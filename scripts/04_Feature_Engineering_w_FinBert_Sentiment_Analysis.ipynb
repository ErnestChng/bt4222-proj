Danker, or her successor as Deputy Secretary, was elected to serve as Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer to comply with an Executive Order issued on December 14, 2005 that requires federal agencies to take certain actions relating to FOIA activities.By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information, primarily to reflect incorporation of the Board\\'s new rules on access to confidential information by non-citizens.By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was selected to execute transactions for the System Open Market.By unanimous vote, Dino Kos was selected to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, on the understanding that his selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was reaffirmed in the form shown below.AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS\\n(Reaffirmed January 31, 2006)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer\\'s ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency  accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.4. In the execution of the Committee\\'s decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee\\'s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee approved the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations with an amendment to paragraph 5 which clarifies the language about permissible investment activities for the foreign portfolio and brings that language into alignment with that present in the authorization for the domestic portfolio.  Accordingly, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was adopted, effective January 31, 2006, as shown below.AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS\\n(Amended January 31, 2006)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Such investments may include buying or selling outright obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof; buying such securities under agreements for repurchase of such securities; selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and holding various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions.  In addition, when appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.7. The Chairman is authorized:A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury;B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in the form shown below.FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE\\n(Reaffirmed January 31, 2006)1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.2. To achieve this end the System shall:A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with selected foreign central banks.C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with international monetary institutions.3. Transactions may also be undertaken:A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States Treasury;B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; andC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under IMF Article IV.Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Foreign Currency Directive and Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations to indicate his opposition to foreign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve.  In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy.  And if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compromise the Federal Reserve\\'s monetary policy independence.By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS\\n(Reaffirmed January 31, 2006)In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.Among the organizational matters raised, the Committee indicated that it intended to take up at a future meeting the relationship between its formal vote and the policy statement issued after each meeting.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that underlying growth in aggregate demand remained solid, even though the expansion of real GDP was estimated to have slowed in the fourth quarter.  Household spending rose smartly, outside of autos, and orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in the business sector were generally quite strong.  Housing markets showed some signs of cooling, but starts and sales remained at high levels.  Industrial production posted moderate gains, even after excluding hurricane-related rebounds in some production categories, and private payrolls expanded at a firm rate on average.  Headline consumer inflation had been held down by falling consumer energy prices; more recently, however, crude oil prices climbed back up to high levels.  Meanwhile, core inflation had moved up a bit from low levels seen last summer.Labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter, as private nonfarm payrolls showed large gains in November followed by more-modest gains in December.  The average increase over those two months represented sturdy job gains, even after accounting for the likely catch-up in employment following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Several sectors, including manufacturing and several service groups, added vigorously to payrolls in December, but the total for the month was held down by employment declines in a number of sectors, such as retail trade and construction, where seasonal adjustment can be difficult this time of year.  Aggregate hours fell slightly in December owing to a decrease in the workweek, but they rose over the fourth quarter as a whole.  The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in part due to the labor force participation rate ticking down.Industrial production rose notably in November and December, boosted by partial recovery from the effects of the hurricanes.  Production in the mining industry, which includes oil and gas extraction, increased sharply.  Utilities output also popped up in December as temperatures turned unseasonably cold in the first half of the month.  Abstracting from the effects of these special factors, underlying activity in the industrial sector advanced moderately.  Modest production increases in most manufacturing categories in December, including high-tech, consumer goods, and business equipment, outweighed production declines in the motor vehicles and parts sector.  The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing stood a bit above its level of one year ago and near its long-run average.Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to have increased only modestly in the fourth quarter, as spending on motor vehicles was restrained following a surge in the summer in response to manufacturers\\' price incentives.  Outside of motor vehicles, consumption was brisk, supported by job growth, increases in personal income, and the decline in energy prices.  Consumption was also likely supported by further gains in home values and equity prices that raised the ratio of household wealth to disposable income relative to that seen earlier in 2005.  Consumer sentiment measured by surveys moved up in December and, judging by the preliminary reading of the Michigan Survey, edged up further in January.Activity in the housing market appeared to continue at high levels, although there were some indications of slowing.  Single-family housing starts decreased markedly in December; however, this decline may have been due in part to unusually cold and wet weather in some areas of the country.  Multifamily housing starts increased in December.  Sales of new and existing homes remained at elevated levels but slowed somewhat toward the end of the year.  Moreover, the stock of homes for sale increased to the upper end of ranges seen in recent years.  Recent data on mortgage applications and survey measures of homebuying attitudes also pointed to some cooling in the housing market.Real outlays for equipment and software appeared to have slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, as expenditures for transportation and communications equipment reversed some of their earlier sharp increases.  With few exceptions, however, new orders appeared to be quite strong, and order backlogs increased for several goods in the transportation sector.  Underlying fundamentals continued to support gains in capital spending as business sector output expanded, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines pushed down the user cost of capital equipment.  Anecdotal reports and surveys also indicated that businesses were optimistic about near-term capital spending plans.  Vacancy rates for nonresidential properties drifted lower as construction expenditures on commercial and manufacturing structures remained well below recent peaks.  However, spending on drilling and mining structures continued to increase strongly.  Business investment in real nonfarm inventories increased moderately in the fourth quarter, boosted by a rapid accumulation of motor vehicle inventories.  Outside of motor vehicles, stocks continued to rise slowly.  The restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall.  That said, the level of stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with demand in most industries.After increasing further in October, the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in November.  The reduction in the deficit reflected a modest increase in exports and a similar-sized decrease in imports that owed importantly to a decline in imports of oil.  The firm pace of third-quarter GDP growth in foreign economies generally appeared to continue in the fourth quarter.Core consumer price inflation remained moderate over the second half of last year.  Core prices had posted a string of very low increases last summer, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices.  In recent months, increases in core prices had rebounded.  The overall consumer price index edged down further in December in response to substantial declines in its volatile energy price components.  However, survey data pointed to large increases in gasoline prices in January, which were due to the backup in crude oil prices.  Preliminary survey measures of near-term inflation expectations for January had nonetheless ticked down, continuing the reversal of a sharp increase after the hurricanes last fall, and longer-term inflation expectations had moved lower as well.  Input prices increased somewhat less in December, as upward pressure from previous energy price increases receded somewhat.  Indeed, the increase in core intermediate producer prices over the year was estimated to be considerably lower than over the previous year.  At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4¼ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.  Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained.  Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflationary pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.Investors had largely anticipated the Committee\\'s interest rate decision at the December meeting and a change in the portions of the statement characterizing policy as accommodative.  Accordingly, the policy announcement elicited only modest reactions in financial markets.  With mixed readings on economic activity and inflation over the intermeeting period, the market\\'s expectations for the path of monetary policy and yields on Treasury coupon securities ended the period little changed, on balance.  Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate debt moved largely in line with Treasury yields.  Major stock price indexes rose modestly, and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the period.Domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have expanded at a somewhat slower pace in the fourth quarter, down from the rapid increase in the third quarter.  Household debt growth likely moderated amid hints of a downshift in mortgage borrowing from its robust third-quarter pace and an outright decline in consumer credit, which owed in part to increased charge-offs from October\\'s spike in bankruptcy filings.  Business sector debt slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, mainly reflecting a runoff of commercial paper by multinational firms that were reported to have repatriated foreign earnings to take advantage of a recently enacted tax provision.  M2 expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter than had been predicted from historical relationships with income and opportunity costs.  In part, the monetary aggregate was likely boosted by payments to hurricane victims by the federal government and insurance companies.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after slow growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, real GDP would expand at a fairly robust pace over the first half of this year, boosted in part by spending on recovery activities associated with the hurricanes.  Thereafter, real GDP growth was expected to moderate, importantly reflecting a reduced impetus to consumption from house price appreciation and some slowing in residential housing expenditures.  Core PCE inflation was expected to be a touch higher this year than in 2005, largely because of the pass-through of higher energy and nonfuel import prices, but, with energy prices leveling out, core inflation was projected to drop back modestly in 2007.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted the slowing in GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but believed that it probably owed in large part to transitory factors and that economic growth would bounce back in the current quarter.  In that regard, several high frequency indicators of production, labor markets, and private demand suggested greater underlying strength of late than had been reflected in the most recent GDP data.  Over the next couple of years, the economy seemed poised to expand at a moderate rate in the neighborhood of its sustainable pace.  Most participants expected core inflation to move up slightly in the near term, reflecting some pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices.  Although heightened inflation pressures could also arise from possible increases in resource utilization, the outlook for economic growth and the stability of inflation expectations suggested that core inflation should remain contained over time.In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2006 and 2007.  The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 2006 were in a range of 3-1/4 to 4 percent, centered at 3-1/2 percent, while those for 2007 were in a range of 3 to 4 percent, with a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with projections of the civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent, with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent, in both the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2007.  Expectations for the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, were in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year, centered at about 2 percent, and in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2007.In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that consumer spending in the latter months of 2005 had been buffeted by the effects of hurricanes, increased energy prices, and reduced auto sales incentives.  However, anecdotal reports contributed to a view that consumer spending had been solid over the holiday season and in recent weeks, while measures of consumer confidence remained high.  Nevertheless, signs of slowing in the housing sector had become more evident, and the boost to construction from hurricane-related rebuilding now seemed likely to be spread over the next couple of years rather than being more concentrated in the near term.  In some areas, home price appreciation reportedly had slowed noticeably, highlighting the risks to aggregate demand of a pullback in the housing sector.  For instance, the effects of a leveling out of housing wealth on the saving rate were difficult to predict, but, in the view of some, potentially sizable.  Rising debt service costs, owing in part to the repricing of variable-rate mortgages, were also mentioned as possibly restraining the discretionary spending of consumers.  The most likely outlook, however, was for a gradual moderation in house price appreciation and in the growth of consumption, which would continue to be supported by increases in jobs and incomes.Participants generally anticipated fairly strong growth of capital expenditures.  Though firms had been cautious about expanding their plant and equipment, business confidence was high, capacity utilization was tightening, and companies were continuing to look for investment opportunities that increased productivity.  As a result, the outlook was for reasonably robust spending on capital equipment even if economic growth slowed a bit.  Anecdotal reports suggested that nonresidential real estate markets were improving in some areas.The slowdown in government spending in the fourth quarter was generally seen as reflecting shifts in the timing of outlays, rather than a change in the underlying trend.  However, fiscal stimulus was expected to diminish somewhat by next year.  By contrast, global demand had picked up of late and would provide ongoing support for U.S. exports; indeed, the sharp increases in commodity prices and rallies in world equity markets suggested the possibility of an even stronger path for demand abroad.Financial market conditions in the United States, as well as those abroad, suggested that investors were optimistic about the economic outlook.  The recent strength in equity markets and the low prevailing term premiums and bond spreads perhaps reflected market assessments that economic risks were lower than usual, as well as strong demands for longer-term assets and an ample supply of liquidity.  The possibility that term premiums and credit spreads could return to more typical settings represented a downside risk for interest-sensitive components of aggregate demand.A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately.  Some participants remarked on the uncertainties regarding the extent of remaining capacity in labor markets and the outlook for labor costs.  In particular, developments affecting the participation rate in the labor force and the pace of growth in productivity would importantly condition prospects for employment and business cost pressures.Participants noted that, while the pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices to prices of core goods and services had remained subdued, there were continuing upside risks to inflation from these sources.  Whatever the size of such pass-through effects, however, it was thought that they would probably be temporary in nature and likely diminish as energy prices flattened out, as long as inflation expectations did not move higher.  In that regard, participants were encouraged that, despite recent energy price increases, survey measures of inflation expectations had notched down and longer-term inflation compensation in financial markets was little changed.  Although high profit margins could imply some existing pricing power, they might also provide a cushion to absorb some future cost increases.  Indeed, anecdotal reports suggested that the ability of firms to pass through higher input costs generally remained limited.  Nevertheless, the increased prices of energy and other commodities and the possibility of a further rise in resource utilization, which some members viewed as nearly full at present, represented continuing risks, potentially adding to inflation pressures.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent at this meeting.  Although recent economic data had been uneven, the economy seemed to be expanding at a solid pace.  Members were concerned that, even after their action today, possible increases in resource utilization and elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  Although the stance of policy seemed close to where it needed to be given the current outlook, some further policy firming might be needed to keep inflation pressures contained and the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.  In the view of some members, the possibility of additional policy moves was reinforced by readings on core inflation and inflation expectations that were somewhat higher than was desirable over the long run.  However, all members agreed that the future path for the funds rate would depend increasingly on economic developments and could no longer be prejudged with the previous degree of confidence.As this meeting marked Alan Greenspan\\'s last as a member of the Committee, meeting participants took the opportunity individually and collectively to pay tribute to his many years of outstanding service to the Federal Reserve and to the nation.  They expressed their appreciation for his collegial and successful leadership of the Committee and of the Federal Reserve System and emphasized the privilege and honor they felt in having served with him.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Votes for this action: Messrs.

Pianalto and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.The confirmation of the date of the next meeting of the Committee was postponed, pending the election of a successor Chairman.The meeting adjourned at 12:25 p.m.Notation Vote \\n        By notation vote completed on December 30, 2005, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held on December 13, 2005.Return to topFOMC I thank you for the invitation to speak today. My remarks will focus on the continuous challenges banking organizations face as they manage risk. Today, banking organizations have a much wider array of risk-management tools and practices available to them, thanks in large part to innovations in financial products and services, improved technology, and many other developments in the industry. But financial innovation also presents new and different aspects of risk that institutions need to address.I will first describe some of the broader risk management issues facing banks. Then, I will describe some guidance supervisors have recently issued to illustrate the importance of these concepts. I know that a number of attorneys who work on banking and financial matters are in the audience, so I will cover not only risks relating directly to lending and trading activities but also those relating to legal and compliance issues.Dimensions of Risk-Management ChallengesCertainly, risk management is not a new challenge. Financial institutions have always faced the task of managing their risk exposures while remaining profitable and competitive. But financial innovation, even when it involves well-established products and exposures that are only slightly altered, continues to present new risk-management challenges. Yet challenges are also opportunities: good risk management is an art that combines the ability to use financial innovation to improve profitability with an understanding of how risk profiles change as a result of that innovation.The Federal Reserve, in its role as both a bank supervisor and the nation’s central bank, has an obvious interest in maintaining the stability of the banking industry and the financial system as a whole. We, along with our counterparts at the other U.S. bank and thrift regulatory agencies, are responsible for ensuring that banking institutions operate in a safe and sound manner. But with the advent of very large banking organizations that engage in a wide variety of business activities--some of them quite complex--the Federal Reserve has become even more interested in ensuring that banking organizations understand the risks of these activities as well as their potential impact.As organizations grow larger, one of their major challenges can be described as making sure that the “right hand” knows what the “left hand” is doing. In other words, risks must be recognized and managed across the entire organization. In some cases, firms may be practicing good risk management on an exposure-by-exposure basis, but they may not be paying close enough attention to aggregation of exposures across the entire organization. Rapid growth can place considerable pressure on, among other areas, an organization’s management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, and asset-liability management.Of course, there are other dimensions of risk to consider besides scale. As noted, the banking organizations we see today often operate in many lines of business and offer many types of products. For example, some organizations have increased their size not just by expanding their existing operations, but also by pursuing several new business lines at the same time. Certainly, this strategy of business diversification has its benefits. But the organization must also understand how the various business components interact on a dynamic basis. In other words, diversification does not simply work on its own, but has to be carefully planned and managed.Another dimension of risk to be considered is the complexity and sophistication of an organization’s products and services. While an institution may alter its risks by expanding into several business lines, the nature of its products and services also makes a tremendous difference in its risk profile. For example, it matters greatly whether an institution expands its mortgage lending by offering traditional mortgage products with which it has substantial experience, or whether an institution offers new mortgage products for which there is little history. At first glance, the new products may appear to be no more risky than more traditional products; however, when more carefully examined, new products can have a higher risk potential, or at least one that is not fully known. Institutions should also be aware that traditional products packaged in a slightly different way or offered to a new customer segment can substantially alter their risk profile. I point to recent cases of legal and compliance risks that occurred because the institutions involved did not necessarily conduct proper due diligence on their new products.The challenge of understanding the potential risks associated with new products in a given business line is heightened when firms attempt to see how those risks intersect with the risks from its other business lines. On the one hand, a firm may be hedging its risks or enhancing diversification by offering new products; on the other hand, the firm may simply be adding to risks it already has. Obviously, knowing the difference is vitally important. Furthermore, an institution has to pay attention to the behavior and performance of its risk mitigants, whose appropriateness and applicability may also vary with changes in the market. The bottom line for today’s banking institutions, particularly the largest and most complex ones, is that they must continue to monitor very carefully the embedded risks of their products and services, pay close attention to subtle changes in business practices that could affect the risks related to a given product, and fully understand how the risks in all their business lines intersect and combine to affect the risk profile of the consolidated entity.Current Perspective on Risk-Management ChallengesCommercial Real EstateNow that I have described in fairly broad terms the types of risk-management challenges institutions may encounter, I think it would be helpful to provide some concrete examples. As you are likely aware, the U.S. banking agencies recently issued for public comment supervisory guidance on commercial real estate (CRE), which focused particularly on CRE concentrations. Regardless of its size, we believe an institution involved in CRE lending would benefit from a review of the guidance. As you know, CRE played a central role in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s and has historically been a highly volatile asset class. Over the past dozen years, CRE concentrations have been rising and are now at record levels at many banking organizations. For certain groups of banks--such as those between $1 billion and $10 billion--average CRE concentrations, which can include owner-occupied CRE, are today above 300 percent. This compares to a previous peak of CRE concentrations of 200 percent seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s.The agencies’ CRE concentration guidance, which excludes owner-occupied CRE, is intended to reinforce existing risk-management guidelines on CRE, and it offers institutions some suggestions for improving their risk-management practices. The agencies share a concern that some institutions’ risk-management practices are not keeping up with the growth in their CRE exposures. The guidance describes the key risk-management elements for an institution’s CRE lending, because banks, in order to attract new business and sustain loan volume, may be inclined to occasionally make some compromises and concessions to borrowers. As supervisors, we want to ensure that loan-to-value standards and debt-service-coverage ratios are meeting the organization’s policies--and that there is not an increasing number of exceptions to those standards and ratios. We also continue to monitor whether lenders routinely adjust covenants, lengthen maturities, or reduce collateral requirements.Additionally, the guidance reemphasizes that institutions should have capital levels appropriate for the risk associated with their CRE concentrations. Some evidence suggests that an institution’s strategic- and capital-planning processes may not adequately acknowledge the risks from its CRE concentrations. By focusing on CRE concentrations, the guidance is also intended to apply to those institutions that might already have excellent underwriting and risk management of their existing CRE exposures but that might not be as vigilant or as rigorous in their management of those exposures on an aggregate portfolio basis. That is, underwriting policies, as well as management and board reporting, should reflect aggregate portfolio risk as CRE loans rise to a significant multiple of capital.A bank with significant concentrations may need to both strengthen its control environment and hold capital well above regulatory minimums. In certain cases, it may be prudent for an institution to reduce its concentrations. This is particularly important, since CRE lending in recent years has occurred under fairly benign credit conditions and, naturally, those conditions are unlikely to continue indefinitely. From a risk-management and capital perspective, institutions should employ stress tests and other exercises to help identify CRE vulnerabilities, including potential correlations with non-CRE exposures that might move in the same direction during a downturn.Nontraditional Mortgage ProductsThe U.S. banking agencies have also issued draft guidance on certain mortgage products. Over the past few years, the agencies have observed an increase in the volume of originations for residential mortgage loans that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and, sometimes, interest. These mortgage loans, often referred to as “nontraditional mortgage loans,” include “interest-only” (IO) mortgage loans, in which a borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years of the loan, and “payment-option” adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), in which a borrower has flexible payment options--and which also could result in negative amortization.In 2005, option ARMs and IOs were an estimated one-third of total U.S. mortgage originations. By contrast, in 2003, these products were estimated to represent less than 10 percent of total originations. Despite the recent publicity, however, it is estimated that these mortgages still account for less than 20 percent of aggregate domestic mortgage outstandings of $8 trillion. While the credit quality of residential mortgages generally remains strong, the Federal Reserve and other banking supervisors are concerned that current risk-management techniques may not fully address the level of risk in nontraditional mortgages, a risk that would be heightened by a downturn in the housing market.Nontraditional mortgage products have been available for many years; however, these types of mortgages were historically offered to higher-income borrowers only. More recently, these products have been offered to a wider spectrum of consumers, including subprime borrowers who may be less suited for these types of mortgages and may not fully recognize their embedded risks. These borrowers are more likely to experience an unmanageable payment shock at some point during the life of the loan, which means they may be more likely to default on the loan. Further, nontraditional mortgage loans are becoming more prevalent in the subprime market at the same time that risk tolerances in the capital markets have increased. When risk spreads return to more “normal” levels, banks need to be prepared for the resulting impact on liquidity and pricing. Supervisors have also observed that lenders are increasingly combining nontraditional mortgage loans with weaker mitigating controls on credit exposures, such as allowing reduced documentation in evaluating the applicant’s creditworthiness and making simultaneous second-lien mortgages as competition in the mortgage banking industry intensifies. These “risk layering” practices have become more and more prevalent in mortgage originations. Thus, while elements of the product structure may have been used successfully by some banks in the past, the absence of traditional underwriting controls may have unforeseen effects on losses realized in these products.In view of these industry trends, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies decided to issue the draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products. The proposed guidance emphasizes that an institution’s risk-management processes should allow it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products. The guidance reminds lenders of the importance of assessing a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, including monthly payments when amortization begins and interest rates rise. Lenders should recognize that certain nontraditional mortgage loans are untested in a stressed environment; for instance, nontraditional mortgage loans to investors that rely on collateral values could be particularly affected by a housing price decline. Bankers should ensure that borrowers have sufficient information so that they clearly understand, before choosing a product or payment option, the terms and associated risks of these loans, particularly how far monthly payments can rise and that negative amortization can increase the amount owed on the property above what was originally borrowed. These products warrant strong risk-management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan-loss reserves.Compliance-Risk ManagementAnother area the financial sector and the regulatory community are focused on today is compliance-risk management. “Compliance risk” can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to an organization’s reputation and franchise value; this type of risk may result when an organization fails to comply with the laws, regulations, or standards or codes of conduct that are applicable to its business activities and functions. The Federal Reserve expects banking organizations to have in place an infrastructure that is able to identify and control the compliance risks facing their organization. Fortunately, many banking organizations in the United States substantially affected by these risks are ahead of the curve and have invested in enterprise-wide corporate compliance.To create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organizations must first understand risks across the entire entity. Managers should be expected to evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually. I also emphasize the need for the board of directors and senior management to ensure that staff members throughout an organization understand the compliance objectives and the role they have in implementing the compliance program. Clear lines of communication and authority help to avoid conflicts of interest.An enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program should be dynamic and proactive, meaning it constantly assesses evolving risks when new business lines or activities are added or when existing activities are altered. To avoid having a program that operates on “autopilot,” an organization must continuously reassess its risks and controls and communicate with its business lines.ConclusionOur ongoing supervision of banking organizations indicates that the preponderance of institutions continues to be sound and well managed. This strong performance has occurred concurrently with institutions’ continued efforts to improve their risk-identification and management strategies. That said, there are certain rapidly growing business lines in banking operations that are placing pressures on risk-management systems. In turn, supervisors are increasingly scrutinizing these business lines to ensure that management is fully aware of their risks and has made any necessary risk-management upgrades.As institutions continue to offer new products and services, they face the challenge of incorporating the associated risks into their existing risk-management framework. This is no small challenge, especially given the growing size and complexity of many banking organizations. Additionally, as supervisors, we want to ensure that institutions are not only able to identify, measure, and manage their risks, but that they are also developing and maintaining appropriate corporate-governance structures to keep up with their business activities and risk-taking. While most U.S. banking organizations enjoy substantial profitability today, they should remember that continued business success depends on their ability to prepare for unexpected, and potentially much less favorable, events and outcomes. Good morning.I would like to begin by thanking President Bush for the confidence he has placed in me and for attending this ceremony. Today marks only the third visit of a President to the Federal Reserve. Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated this building in 1937 and Gerald R. Ford visited in 1975. Mr. President, you do us a great honor.Members of the President\\'s economic team and the heads of the federal financial regulatory agencies have also joined us this morning. I have greatly enjoyed collaborating with many of you during my time in Washington, and I look forward to working with you in the future. Thank you for coming.I would like to extend a special welcome to members of Congress. The Federal Reserve was created by Congress in 1913 and entrusted with the power, granted originally to the Congress by the U.S. Constitution, to coin money and regulate the value thereof. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the Federal Reserve to report regularly to, and work closely with, the Congress. I look forward to a strong and constructive relationship with members of both the House and Senate.Former chairmen Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan also honor us with their attendance. Their leadership and insight have contributed immeasurably to the strength and stability of our economy. The nation and the world owe a debt of gratitude to these two great Americans.That these distinguished guests have chosen to join us today is a testament to the centrality of this institution to the nation\\'s economic life. Our mission, as set forth by the Congress, is a critical one: to preserve price stability, to foster maximum sustainable growth in output and employment, and to promote a stable and efficient financial system that serves all Americans well and fairly. In his remarks in this building in 1937, President Roosevelt described as our purpose \"to gain for all of our people the greatest attainable measure of economic well-being, the largest degree of economic security and stability.\"As I contemplate taking up the challenge of leading an institution with such weighty responsibilities, I count, first, on the love and support of my family: my wife Anna, son Joel, and daughter Alyssa, who are here today. I know also that I can rely on the enormous strengths of this institution: excellent leadership on the Board and in the Reserve Banks and unmatched expertise and experience in the staff. Mr. President, as you know, on September 11, 2001, and the days that followed, Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., who just swore me in, and many members of the Federal Reserve staff--here, in New York and around the country--worked inexhaustibly to ensure the continued functioning and recovery of the American financial system. The dedication and knowledge demonstrated that day by so many people exemplifies why the Federal Reserve as an institution is far more than any single individual.To my Board colleagues and to the staff here today, I would like to say thank you for your service to your country and to the world. I am happy to be back among you and look forward to working with you in the days and years ahead. Together I am confident that we will meet whatever challenges the future may bring.Thank you all for coming. I am honored to deliver the keynote address at this important international symposium. Our focus today--on how developments and challenges around the world are reshaping the insurance industry and its regulation in Europe, Latin America, China, and India as well as here in the United States--is certainly warranted. The worldwide integration of economies and financial markets is increasing, and a sound and vibrant insurance and reinsurance industry is needed to sustain global economic growth. Thus, I am glad to see that this symposium has brought together regulators and major market participants from all parts of the globe.Within the United States, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has over the years promoted interstate collaboration on regulatory matters, established and maintained a centralized information system, and supported and improved the state regulation of insurance. Through its work, the NAIC has enhanced the reliability and financial health of the domestic insurance industry.The NAIC has also been active in fostering cooperation on supervisory issues in the international insurance arena, through groups such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), which the NAIC currently chairs; the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and the Joint Forum. The NAIC is, of course, also actively involved, through the IAIS, in the work of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), of which Alessandro Iuppa is a member. The work of the FSF is the main topic I will speak about today. Before I proceed, I want to say that the views I will express are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Board of Governors.The FSF has taken an interest in a variety of developments affecting the financial sector in recent years. I would like to leave you with three messages based on its work in this area: first, effective collaboration among regulators and other authorities is important; second, enhanced transparency and disclosure are important; third, firms and regulators need to have early and continuous dialogue on regulatory developments.I will discuss these statements in a minute, but before turning to them I want to give you some background on the creation of the Financial Stability Forum, its composition, and its purpose. As you may know, the FSF was established in 1999, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, to promote international financial stability. The FSF uniquely brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in major international financial centers, representatives from international financial institutions, representatives of international regulatory committees, and committees of central bank experts. Its role is to foster cooperation among authorities at a global level in identifying vulnerabilities and strains in the global financial system and developing strategies to reduce systemic risk.An important element of the FSF\\'s work is to assess risks to financial stability that might arise from current economic and financial developments, to discuss risk scenarios, and to consider the capacity of the financial sector to absorb shocks. Several years of solid economic growth and a benign financial environment have helped strengthen balance sheets in the financial sector, and this strength seems likely to continue. Nonetheless, a number of risks and potential vulnerabilities are receiving attention, including the implications for growth and inflation of high oil prices; global fiscal and current account imbalances; elevated house prices and household debt; the compression of risk spreads, which has contributed to low long-term yields; and the potential financial fallout from geopolitical events.I am sure that you yourselves are closely evaluating what these and other matters imply for the insurance industry. Consider, for example, the effect of low long-term interest rates on the insurance sector. Low interest rates may have induced some firms to take on extra exposure through investment in higher-risk assets, including complex or less highly-rated credit products. In some cases, mainly outside the United States, insurers have had difficulty earning sufficient returns to meet the minimum rate they have committed to pay to policyholders. Generally, however, the industry seems to be increasingly focused on better matching the risk characteristics and duration of assets and liabilities. In fact, this better match may be one factor supporting low yields on longer-dated fixed-income assets, at least in some markets.But there are other potential explanations for the low long-term rates now prevailing in many countries. These other explanations include an excess of desired global saving over desired global investment spending and a decline in the risk premia demanded by investors, with the latter likely due in part to a marked decline in the volatility of economic activity and inflation. Suffice it to say, we do not have a full understanding of the complex forces that have driven rates down, and the topic is likely to be debated for some time to come. Some observers have expressed concern about the possibility of a steep rise in long-term rates from their currently low levels. Were such a move to occur, the implications for the economy and asset prices would depend on the source of the rate increase. If, for example, desired investment spending were to strengthen--thereby boosting economic growth--the induced rise in longer-term rates need not be a worrisome development. On the other hand, a sharp increase in risk premia, whether because of a rise in perceived risk or a reduced willingness to bear risk, likely would be more problematic. We simply cannot know before the fact whether a potential rise in longer-term interest rates would be disruptive or not.In addition to their exposure from unexpected developments in financial markets, insurers face a variety of other significant risks, including the potential liability arising from acts of terrorism and natural disasters. At present there is also much speculation about the likelihood and the possible effects of an Avian flu pandemic. The possibility of a pandemic gives rise to new issues for insurance and reinsurance companies. Pandemics may result in significant losses for parts of the insurance sector from increased sickness and mortality. At the same time, a pandemic could pose operational challenges by causing widespread and extended absenteeism and by disrupting the usual flow of goods and services throughout the world economy. All firms, including insurers, would probably be wise to give serious thought to the question of how they would run their business in the event of an Avian flu pandemic.Given that the industry faces these and other risks, the three messages I mentioned earlier take on special significance. I would now like to expound on each of them.Effective collaboration among financial authoritiesGlobalization is creating new business opportunities, opening new markets, increasing efficiency, decreasing the cost of capital, and enabling well-managed companies to deliver expanded services and greater shareholder value. However, these forces are also prompting financial companies to develop far-flung business operations, which make group management and risk aggregation more challenging. At the same time, these forces are blurring business and sectoral lines and making exposures more interrelated. Such challenges to management exist even in a totally domestic setting, but globalization has increased their difficulty and complexity and has intensified the need for supervisory collaboration, especially between home and host supervisors, within and across sectors.In the United States, the nationwide reach of the largest insurers has led to an increasing emphasis on interstate cooperation among insurance supervisors through the NAIC. Now the development of financial conglomerates has rightly prompted increased links with supervisors in other sectors. Meanwhile, globalization has necessitated intensified supervisory cooperation at the international level. In this respect, I am encouraged to see that the NAIC has been meeting twice a year with the European Union since 1999 to address issues affecting transatlantic insurance business. These meetings have led to a Memorandum of Understanding on information exchange and to discussions about the supervision of reinsurance. Similar arrangements for information exchange have also been established with insurance regulators in China, India, Japan, Latin America, and Russia.I should also like to commend the IAIS for its work over the years in promoting international insurance standards and information exchange. The FSF greatly welcomes the continuing work by the IAIS on encouraging practical cooperation among supervisory authorities and on examining whether there are significant barriers to the exchange of information relating to groups and conglomerates.Regulators must sustain work in this direction as insurance activity continues to expand internationally, resulting in large, internationally active insurance groups. Because of the formation and activity of such large groups, regulators must have a good picture of the totality of risks that each insurance or reinsurance group is running. Regulators need to confer and to compare national systems so as to identify regulatory best-practices and avoid duplicative regulatory work. It is important also for each regulator to understand and evaluate the major changes in the laws and regulations in the other regulators\\' countries and the international implications of the changes. Developing strong working relationships through regular, ongoing dialogue also creates better channels for communication when difficulties arise.For cross-sectoral international issues, the NAIC makes a valuable contribution to the work of the Joint Forum, which as you know is a group that brings together banking, securities, and insurance regulators from many countries to evaluate and address cross-sectoral regulatory issues. Some key areas of the Joint Forum\\'s work in which the FSF has taken a close interest are the review of the regulatory and market differences across sectors; credit risk transfer; high-level principles regarding outsourcing and business continuity; and the funding of liquidity risk. Many of these issues have the potential to affect financial stability and are of interest not only to the supervisors but to our central bank and finance ministry members.Enhanced transparency and disclosureTransparency and public disclosure are essential for the efficient functioning of markets. Counterparties and investors need to be clear about the risks that firms and the industry are taking in order to manage their own exposures.The FSF takes an active interest in this area. Its interest is not just to the narrow question of determining which data items to disclose but in the whole process of information disclosure. The FSF is promoting the development of high standards for accounting and auditing, the establishment of public-interest bodies to oversee the standardsetters\\' work, and the development and adoption of best-practice disclosure.Let me elaborate a little on the FSF\\'s interest in the transparency and disclosure practices of the reinsurance sector. After the events of September 11, 2001, and the significant downturn in global equity markets in 2001-02, questions arose whether reinsurance capital might erode to the point that primary insurance capacity would deteriorate. Also at that time anecdotal reports of the industry\\'s growing involvement in credit risk transfer activities, both as investors and as sellers of credit protection, led to concern that such involvement increased the risk that reinsurance difficulties could have wider implications in the financial system. The FSF found that the absence of adequate information at the time made it difficult to assess the knock-on effects of potential difficulties in the sector on primary insurance and on other areas of the financial system.As a result, the FSF encouraged and supported efforts by the IAIS and its working groups (Task Force Re and the Reinsurance Transparency Group) to shed light on these issues. The first and second Global Reinsurance Market reports have since been released and have been well received by FSF members and other users of information. Despite limitations arising, in part, from different accounting conventions, the reports provide analysis that enables stakeholders to gain deeper insight into the structure and profile of the reinsurance industry and its links with other sectors of the wider financial system.Forum members have expressed an ongoing interest in further information on the reinsurance industry\\'s systemic links. In this regard, I would also like to welcome the recent work by the G30 on the reinsurance sector and international financial markets. Contained in the G30 report is a chapter on transparency that sets out a framework to improve the disclosure of risk information by reinsurers. With financial markets and product offerings constantly evolving, firms and the industry must release timely, comprehensive, and meaningful information to enable counterparties, investors, and regulators to do their evaluation and analysis.Early and continuous dialogue about regulatory developmentsOne area that is now receiving attention in both the private and the official communities is the perception that the financial industry is suffering from regulatory overload. This perception arises partly because of a bunching of regulatory initiatives in recent years. But concern about a more continuous accumulation of regulation over time has also arisen.Of course, regulations that improve the strength and integrity of the financial system justify an element of regulatory burden. At the same time, the costs and benefits of new regulations need to be carefully weighed against each other, taking full account of financial industry input. Industry commentary has already resulted in significant and beneficial changes to regulations and directives. I encourage firms to continue engaging actively and early with regulatory authorities on the range of international regulatory and legislative developments to ensure that the authorities have the full benefit of your expertise as they set policy.All these changes mean challenging times for both industry participants and regulators. Companies must keep up with changing regulations and reporting requirements and must allocate part of their limited time and resources to dealing with them. Regulatory resources are stretched as well, and I understand many regulators are working hard to ensure that the intensity of regulatory implementation efforts does not divert resources from ongoing supervision. Regulators and industry participants will have to work together to meet these challenges.We must recognize, however, that regulatory initiatives also reflect a more complex environment. Governments and the public at large understandably want to ensure that safety and soundness are maintained despite complexity. The intricate challenge here is to find the right balance between regulation, on the one hand, and the fostering of industry-led solutions through improved risk management and market practices, on the other.I should like to say that the FSF fully supports the role of the IAIS as the global standard setter for the insurance and reinsurance industry. We also commend the IAIS on the good work it has been doing in developing principles, standards, and guidance on insurance and reinsurance supervision and in promoting their implementation. This work contributes significantly to improved supervision of the insurance industry, to the development of well-regulated insurance markets, and to global financial stability.The NAIC has been active in monitoring discussions and reviewing and commenting on insurance regulatory and supervisory papers. I have no doubt that, given the importance of the coming initiatives, the NAIC will continue to do so.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, it has been my pleasure to set out some thoughts about several issues you will debate at this symposium. I think that you will agree with me on the need for effective supervisory collaboration, for enhanced transparency, for public disclosure, and for a dialogue with industry participants to ensure a well-designed regulatory regime that is effective and proportionate to the risks it addresses.The good news is that, in the future, growing global markets will present new and potentially rewarding opportunities for insurance companies. Perhaps the not-so-good news is that the industry is also likely to face a multitude of challenges. The industry has made much progress in recent years. Insurers and reinsurers have revised their underwriting philosophies, developed new models to assess risk, improved the adequacy of their risk profiles, and adjusted their coverage policies. Many regulators have also made significant changes to ensure that their regulations keep pace with developments or, at least, do not fall too far behind. These efforts give me confidence that both firms and regulators will continue to meet the challenges that lie ahead.Thank you, and I wish you all a very fruitful symposium. It is a great pleasure for me to return to Princeton today, to see so many friends and former colleagues, and to help celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. I taught at Princeton for seventeen years--more often than not in Bowl 1, in the deep, dark basement of Robertson Hall--and my wife Anna and I raised our two children here. Like all good New Jerseyans, we will always think of our home address in terms of a Turnpike exit--in our case, Exit 9.As you know, the Woodrow Wilson School is named after a renowned Princeton professor of politics and law who, having determined from a stint as the University\\'s president that the institution was essentially ungovernable, decided to try his hand at public service. I do not presume to draw any comparisons between myself and the nation\\'s twenty-eighth President, of course; but besides the Princeton affiliation, we have in common a connection with the Federal Reserve System. President Wilson made the establishment of the Federal Reserve one of his early legislative priorities, signing the Federal Reserve Act into law in December 1913, less than a year after taking office. Wilson helped to negotiate the complex political compromises that finally gave the nation a permanent central bank, following two earlier failed attempts.To simplify a complex history, earlier attempts to stabilize the monetary arrangements of the United States had frequently been roiled by perceived conflicts of interest between (on the one hand) the farmers and tradespeople of Main Street America, who believed that they were most advantaged by policies of easy credit, and (on the other hand) the financial barons of Wall Street, who, as creditors and bondholders, preferred \"hard-money,\" low-inflation policies. Recognizing that all parties would be served by a central bank that could help contain the periodic financial crises that afflicted the U.S. economy, Wilson worked with the Congress to develop a structure for the central bank that finely balanced competing interests and concerns. In particular, the Federal Reserve was given a regional structure, with twelve Reserve Banks that were distributed around the country and were empowered to represent sectional interests and to respond to local conditions. Although Wilson understood the political and practical advantages of decentralization, he also resisted some powerful proponents of a completely decentralized system by supporting the creation of a Board of Governors in Washington to oversee and coordinate the activities of the regional Reserve Banks.One of my goals today is to consider the relationships among the three apparently disparate objectives of monetary policy. In particular, I will argue for what I believe has become the consensus view, that the mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment are almost entirely complementary. Central bankers, economists, and other knowledgeable observers around the world agree that price stability both contributes importantly to the economy\\'s growth and employment prospects in the longer term and moderates the variability of output and employment in the short to medium term.The Dual Role of Price StabilityPrice stability plays a dual role in modern central banking: It is both an end and a means of monetary policy.In principle, the problem of inflation could be reduced by the practice of indexing dollar payments such as interest and wages to the price level, but people seem to find indexing costly and avoid it when they can. It is interesting and instructive, for example, that the indexation of wages to prices in labor contracts has always been quite limited in the United States; some indexation was used during the high-inflation 1970s but the practice has been substantially reduced since then. Moreover, some countries that adopted indexing during high-inflation periods, such as Brazil and Israel, largely abandoned the practice when inflation receded. Borrowers and lenders likewise seem to prefer to contract in dollar terms, although inflation-indexed financial instruments have gained wider acceptance in recent years. Borrowing and lending in dollar terms, particularly for long periods, requires confidence that the purchasing power of the currency will be stable and predictable. The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which cost U.S. taxpayers roughly $150 billion, is an example of the kind of problem that can arise in the absence of price stability. An important source of the S&L crisis was the unexpected inflation of the 1970s, which greatly reduced the real value of mortgage loans made by the S&Ls in an earlier, low-inflation era. These losses effectively de-capitalized the savings and loans, helping to set the stage for the problems that followed.Although price stability is an end of monetary policy, it is also a means by which policy can achieve its other objectives. In the jargon, price stability is both a goal and an intermediate target of policy. As I will discuss, when prices are stable, both economic growth and stability are likely to be enhanced, and long-term interest rates are likely to be moderate. Thus, even a policymaker who places relatively less weight on price stability as a goal in its own right should be careful to maintain price stability as a means of advancing other critical objectives.Let me elaborate briefly on the relationship between price stability and the other two goals of monetary policy. First, price stability promotes efficiency and long-term growth by providing a monetary and financial environment in which economic decisions can be made and markets can operate without concern about unpredictable fluctuations in the purchasing power of money. As I have already noted, the dollar provides a reasonably secure gauge of real economic values only when inflation is low and stable. High and variable inflation degrades the quality of the signals coming from the price system, as producers and consumers find it difficult to distinguish price changes arising from changes in product supplies and demands from changes arising from general inflation. Because prices constitute a market economy\\'s fundamental means of conveying information, the increased noise associated with high inflation erodes the effectiveness of the market system. High inflation also complicates long-term economic planning, creating incentives for households and firms to shorten their horizons and to spend resources in managing inflation risk rather than focusing on the most productive activities.Research is not definitive about the extent to which price stability enhances economic growth. We do not have controlled experiments in macroeconomics, and inflation and growth are both endogenous variables that respond jointly to many factors. Nevertheless, I am confident that the effect is positive and see the international experience as at least consistent with the view that, in combination with other sound policies, the maintenance of price stability has quite significant benefits for efficiency and growth. That view appears to be widely shared among policymakers, as governments around the world have made extensive efforts to bring inflation down over the past two decades or so, with substantial success.More recently, the evidence has mounted not only that low and stable inflation is beneficial for growth and employment in the long-term but also that it contributes importantly to greater stability of output and employment in the short to medium term. Specifically, during the past twenty years or so, in the United States and other industrial countries the volatility of both inflation and output have significantly decreased--a phenomenon known to economists as the Great Moderation (Bernanke, 2004). This finding challenges some conventional economic views, according to which greater stability of inflation can be achieved only by allowing greater fluctuations in output and employment. The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public\\'s expectations of inflation will also be low and stable. In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.This mechanism can be illustrated by comparing the effects of the recent rise in oil prices to the effects of the oil price increases of the 1970s. Thirty years ago, the public\\'s expectations of inflation were not well anchored. With little confidence that the Fed would keep inflation low and stable, the public at that time reacted to the oil price increases by anticipating that inflation would rise still further. A destabilizing wage-price spiral ensued as firms and workers competed to \"keep up\" with inflation. The Fed, attempting to gain control of the deteriorating inflation situation, raised interest rates sharply; however, initially at least, these increases proved insufficient to control inflation or inflation expectations, and they added substantially to the volatility of output and employment. The episode highlights the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable, which can be done only if inflation itself is low and stable.By contrast, the oil price increases of recent years appear to have had only a limited effect on core inflation (that is, inflation in the prices of goods other than energy and food), nor do they appear to have generated significant macroeconomic volatility. Several factors account for the better performance of the economy in the recent episode, including improvements in energy efficiency and in the overall flexibility and resiliency of the economy. But, the crucial difference from the 1970s, in my view, is that today inflation expectations are low and stable (as shown, for example, by many surveys and a variety of financial indicators). Oil price increases in the past few years, unlike in the 1970s, have not fed through to any great extent into longer-term inflation expectations and core inflation, as the public has shown confidence that any increases in inflation will be temporary and that, in the long run, inflation will remain low. As a result, the Fed has not had to raise interest rates sharply as it did in the 1970s but instead has been able to pursue a policy that is more gradual and predictable. Of course, the relatively benign state of inflation expectations we enjoy today has not come automatically. The anchoring of inflation expectations in a narrow range has been the product of Fed policies that have kept actual inflation low in recent years, clear communication of those policies, and an institutional commitment to price stability.Price stability also contributes to the third component of the Fed\\'s mandate, the objective of moderate long-term interest rates. As first pointed out by the economist Irving Fisher, interest rates will tend to move in tandem with changes in expected inflation, as lenders require compensation for the loss in purchasing power of their principal over the period of the loan. When inflation is expected to be low, lenders will require less compensation, and thus interest rates will tend to be low as well. In addition, because price stability and the associated macroeconomic stability reduce the risks of holding long-term bonds and other securities, price stability may also reduce the premiums that lenders charge for bearing risk, lowering the overall level of rates.The Origins of the Modern Consensus on Price StabilityI have briefly laid out the modern consensus that price stability, besides being desirable in itself, tends also to increase economic growth and stability. As I noted earlier, however, this view is quite different from the one that prevailed forty years ago. At that time, the ascendant paradigm was that society faced a long-term tradeoff between price stability and high employment. Implied in this position was a potential conflict between defenders of \"hard money\" and supporters of easy credit that echoed, at least faintly, the political conflicts that Wilson faced in setting up the Federal Reserve. The development of the modern consensus was a fascinating example of the way economic science progresses through the interaction of academic research and policy experience--exactly the kind of activity that the Woodrow Wilson School was designed to promote. Thus I thought I might briefly describe the evolution of that consensus here today.The idea of the permanent tradeoff did not go unchallenged, however. In 1967, economists Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps independently produced influential critiques of this view. Their key contribution was to observe that, if inflation expectations react to changes in actual inflation in an economically reasonable way, then any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would be short-lived at best. To illustrate their argument, let us suppose that firms and workers set nominal wages once a year but that, sometime during the year, the prices of firms\\' output rise unexpectedly as a result of stronger-than-expected demand. The combination of higher prices for their output and fixed nominal wages would raise the profitability of increasing production; thus, assuming that more workers are available at the previously fixed wage, firms would respond to the rise in prices by adding workers. Over a short period, then, higher inflation might bring lower unemployment, consistent with the empirical results found by Phillips.However, this logic applies only during the period in which wages and workers\\' expectations of inflation are fixed. If inflation were to rise persistently, Friedman and Phelps argued, workers\\' expectations of inflation would not remain unchanged but would adjust to match the actual rate of inflation. Higher inflation expectations would in turn lead workers to bargain for commensurate raises in nominal wages to preserve the real value of their earnings. With nominal wages rising as well as prices, firms would no longer have an incentive to hire additional workers, and employment would return to its normal level. An attempt to stimulate the economy by choosing a permanently higher level of inflation could thus not succeed, according to this analysis; such an attempt would leave the economy with higher inflation but a level of employment no different than it would have been otherwise. This work was both brilliant and prescient. In particular, among the seminal contributions of the Friedman and Phelps analyses was the identification of the key role of inflation expectations in determining the behavior of the economy, a point that remains central to our thinking today.Moreover, the performance of the U.S. economy soon bore out the predictions made by Friedman and Phelps. The inflationary policies of the 1960s led not to permanently lower unemployment, as the permanent-tradeoff theory predicted, but instead to persistently higher inflation with no improvement in unemployment. For example, in the 1970s, core inflation averaged 6\\xa0percent, compared with 2-1/4\\xa0percent in the 1960s, and unemployment in the 1970s averaged 6-1/4\\xa0percent, compared with the 4-3/4\\xa0percent rate in the 1960s. The volatility of output and (especially) inflation both increased, as the Fed struggled to contain inflation expectations. Other factors, including the aforementioned surge in oil prices, played a role in the deterioration of economic performance in the 1970s. Clearly, though, the theory that a long-run tradeoff exists between inflation and unemployment had sprung a serious leak.Alan Greenspan, who succeeded Volcker as Fed Chairman in 1987, continued to work to stabilize inflation and inflation expectations. Under Greenspan, the Federal Reserve gradually brought core inflation down further, to about 2\\xa0percent in recent years. The Greenspan era also saw important steps toward increased transparency at the Federal Reserve, which helped to clarify for the public the Federal Reserve\\'s strong institutional commitment to price stability. In a sense, Chairman Greenspan had the harder sell: As an economist would say, we might expect diminishing marginal returns to inflation reduction. Yet I think subsequent events demonstrate clear benefits from the tenacity of the Fed under Greenspan. Lower inflation has been accompanied by inflation expectations that are not only lower but better anchored, so far as we can tell. Most striking, Greenspan\\'s tenure aligns closely with the Great Moderation, the reduction in economic volatility I mentioned earlier, as well as with a strong revival in U.S. productivity growth--developments that had many sources, no doubt, but that were supported, in my view, by monetary stability. Like Volcker, Greenspan was ahead of academic thinking in recognizing the potential benefits of increased price stability. Indeed, in recent years, academic research on monetary policy has caught up with the policymakers, providing new support for what I have termed the modern consensus, that price stability supports both strong growth and stability in output and employment.ConclusionPrice stability plays a dual role in monetary policy. Stable prices are desirable in themselves and thus are an important goal of monetary policy. But stable prices are also a prerequisite to the achievement of the Federal Reserve\\'s other mandated objectives, high employment and moderate long-term interest rates. In particular, low and stable inflation and inflation expectations enhance both economic growth and economic stability.The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers. That consensus has not been achieved easily, however, but is the product of many years of policy experience, policy leadership, and sustained economic analysis. No doubt we will continue to learn about the economy and economic policy, even as we benefit from the insights of those who went before us. I am sure the Woodrow Wilson School, its faculty, and its students will continue to play an important role in that ongoing process.ReferencesFeldstein, Martin (1997). \"The Costs and Benefits of Going from Low Inflation to Price Stability,\" in Christina D.

Your theme, \"Celebrating Community: A Tribute to Black Technical, Educational, and Social/Civic Institutions,\" aptly highlights a number of the key building blocks that have enabled many African Americans to fulfill their personal dreams. In that regard, I would like to focus my talk today on education--its importance and its ongoing role in economic achievement.As members of an organization dedicated to cutting-edge scientific research and development, you undoubtedly deeply appreciate the ongoing need for our nation\\'s workforce to embody advanced levels of training. Investment in human capital--as we economists like to call it--is critical to generating products and services with high economic value. Today, much of that high-value output demands workers with the creativity, cognitive abilities, and skills to interact with challenging technologies. In addition, ongoing innovation requires workers to be flexible and to be willing to view education as a life-long commitment. In short, an educated workforce is a must if our economy is to continue to enjoy significant gains in productivity and living standards.At the same time, the link between education and individual economic success is well documented. An investment in education is associated with a higher probability of employment. For African Americans, a college degree can substantially narrow the longstanding gap between their labor market experiences and those of whites. Last year, for example, when the national unemployment rate averaged 5.1 percent, the jobless rate for black adults (25 years and older) with a bachelor\\'s degree or higher was 3.5 percent; for white adults, the jobless rate was 2 percent. For persons with only a high school diploma, both the rates of joblessness and the disparity between the rate for blacks and that for whites were greater: an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent for blacks versus 4 percent for whites.Clearly, economic achievement and educational achievement are intertwined. For that reason, education is at the heart of efforts to promote equal opportunity for all Americans. We have made some progress in opening doors to education for African Americans; we must make more.Of course our job is not done when our students reach high school graduation--indeed, in today\\'s economy, it is only just beginning. Our goal must be to see that our investments in motivating and educating students in our homes and in the elementary and secondary schools provide the students with the ability to pursue the advanced education and training that today\\'s labor market values so highly.The 2004 results show that economic progress for blacks, as measured by real net worth, has been substantial over the fifteen years that the surveys have been conducted. Real median net worth for African-American households in 2004, at $20,400, was more than three and one-half times as great as it was in 1989. That said, the wealth gap between blacks and non-Hispanic whites, whose median real net worth stood at $140,700 in 2004, remains sizable. A substantial part of the wealth gap between black and non-Hispanic white families is associated with their ownership of assets. Although the racial wealth gap is significant at the top of the wealth distribution, a more important difference is that a much greater proportion of African-American families than whites have zero or near-zero real net worth.The increase in ownership of nonfinancial assets for black households in recent years occurred primarily in residences, other real estate, and privately held businesses. Because none of these types of assets is owned by a large share of black families, any wealth gains arising from them will not be widely distributed across black families. Nonetheless, blacks continued to make progress in homeownership in 2004. As is the case regardless of race, the home is typically a family\\'s largest and most important asset. Homeownership is one of the cornerstones of wealth creation and is generally associated with a range of socially desirable outcomes, including better schools, less crime, and greater neighborhood stability. For these and other reasons, increasing the rate of homeownership has been a longstanding national priority. Of course, because we are interested not simply in homeownership or the value of homes but in net worth, an important consideration in terms of wealth creation is the amount of equity that families have in their homes--that is the difference between the value of the home and any debt secured by it. Over the most recent survey period, during which property values have risen rapidly, the median value of home equity for African-American homeowners increased an impressive 24 percent.Business ownership, too, remains an important avenue of wealth creation for African Americans. The median net worth of black families with business assets was about $174,000 in 2004, a level more than eight times the median net worth for all black families. Furthermore, the survey results show far less inequality in median net worth and income between black and non-Hispanic white business owners than between black and non-Hispanic white families overall.All told, the findings from our most recent survey, along with the other trends that I discussed earlier, highlight noticeable gains in the economic well-being of African Americans. However, they also clearly show that much more needs to be accomplished, and I believe that education is the key to further progress.Given the importance of education in today\\'s economy, I was encouraged to see that the Applied Physics Laboratory is committed to a number of programs that engage minority students at all levels of schooling. These programs are aimed at developing a commitment to lifelong learning--beginning with an introduction to math, science, and technology in our primary and secondary schools. In light of the differences in college completion rates I noted earlier, I was glad to see that APL offers internships for talented minority undergraduates in computer science and engineering that give them opportunities to do research and to be mentored by professionals in their fields and that it provides support for graduate study in engineering.Although most of my remarks today have centered on the economic value of education, I want to emphasize that a good education is much more that just the classroom-based learning of facts, or even the skill of critical thinking. Formal education is just the starting point for a lifetime of learning and doing. And a truly outstanding education is one that instills in students moral values and ethical behaviors. In striving to encourage our students to do \"well,\" we must not forsake our responsibility to give them a solid grounding in those topics that will help them do \"good.\" You may be surprised to hear that even the economics profession--well-known for its hard-headed assumption of rational actors pursuing their own self interest--has in the past few decades focused on the role of moral and cooperative behaviors in leading to better economic outcomes. The accounting and corporate governance scandals in recent years have revealed how costly such unethical and opportunistic business dealings can be, potentially to all of us.Let me close by saying that the economy of the United States depends greatly on an educated workforce--one with the skills to tackle new ideas and new technologies, one in which morals and ethics are deeply instilled, and one with a love of learning, exploring, and questioning that lasts a lifetime. The African-American community\\'s commitment to education as a path to equal opportunity dates back at least to Frederick Douglass. We all must resolve to keep that longstanding commitment strong.Footnotes The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent.  Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid. Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.  Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and Janet L. Yellen.  In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 5-1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Chairman Bernanke presented identical testimony before the Committee on Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 16, 2006\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to present the Federal Reserve\\'s Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I look forward to working closely with the members of this Committee on issues of monetary policy as well as on matters regarding the other responsibilities with which the Congress has charged the Federal Reserve System. \\nThe U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose 2 million in 2005, and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly. \\nThe economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again, in response to increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life; destroyed homes, personal property, businesses, and infrastructure on a massive scale; and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries, with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region\\'s ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen, in part, in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence--including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January--suggests that the economic expansion remains on track. \\nInflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained. \\nWith the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, bringing its level to 4-1/2 percent. \\nAt that meeting¸ monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next two years. The central tendency of the forecasts of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly two years, I am comfortable with these projections. \\nIn the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that, to an extent greater than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of non-energy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy now appears to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy\\'s sustainable potential is difficult, and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that, with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur. \\nNot all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy; besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on non-energy goods and services. \\nAlthough the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear that substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data. \\nIn assessing the prospects for the economy, some appreciation of recent circumstances is essential, so let me now review key developments of 2005 and discuss their implications for the outlook. The household sector was a mainstay of the economic expansion again last year, and household spending is likely to remain an important source of growth in aggregate demand in 2006. The growth in household spending last year was supported by rising employment and moderate increases in wages. Expenditures were buoyed as well by significant gains in household wealth that reflected further increases in home values and in broad equity prices. However, sharply rising bills for gasoline and heating reduced the amount of income available for spending on other consumer goods and services. \\nResidential investment also expanded considerably in 2005, supported by a strong real estate market. However, as I have already noted, some signs of slowing in the housing market have appeared in recent months: Home sales have softened, the inventory of unsold homes has risen, and indicators of homebuilder and homebuyer sentiment have turned down. Anecdotal information suggests that homes typically are on the market somewhat longer than they were a year or so ago, and the frequency of contract offers above asking prices reportedly has diminished. Financial market conditions seem to be consistent with some moderation in housing activity. Interest rates on thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which were around 5-3/4 percent over much of 2005, rose noticeably in the final months of the year to their current level of around 6-1/4 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have climbed more considerably. Still, despite the recent increases, mortgage rates remain relatively low. Low mortgage rates, together with expanding payrolls and incomes and the need to rebuild after the hurricanes, should continue to support the housing market. Thus, at this point, a leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook for home prices and construction. In any case, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor this sector closely. \\nOverall, the financial health of households appears reasonably good. Largely reflecting the growth in home mortgages, total household debt continued to expand rapidly in 2005. But the value of household assets also continued to climb strongly, driven by gains in home prices and equity shares. To some extent, sizable increases in household wealth, as well as low interest rates, have contributed in recent years to the low level of personal saving. Saving last year was probably further depressed by the rise in households\\' energy bills. Over the next few years, saving relative to income is likely to rise somewhat from its recent low level. \\nIn the business sector, profits continued to rise last year at a solid pace, boosted in part by continuing advances in productivity. Strong corporate balance sheets combined with expanding sales and favorable conditions in financial markets fostered a solid increase in spending on equipment and software last year. Investment in high-tech equipment rebounded, its increase spurred by further declines in the prices of high-tech goods. Expenditures for communications equipment, which had fallen off earlier this decade, showed particular strength for the year as a whole. In contrast, nonresidential construction activity remained soft. \\nAlthough the financial condition of the business sector is generally quite strong, several areas of structural weakness are evident, notably in the automobile and airline industries. Despite these problems, however, favorable conditions in the business sector as a whole should encourage continued expansion of capital investment. \\nFor the most part, the financial situation of state and local governments has improved noticeably over the past couple of years. Rising personal and business incomes have buoyed tax revenues, affording some scope for increases in state and local government expenditures. At the federal level, the budget deficit narrowed appreciably in fiscal 2005. Outlays rose rapidly, but receipts climbed even more sharply as the economy expanded. However, defense expenditures, hurricane relief, and increasing entitlement costs seem likely to worsen the deficit in fiscal 2006. \\nOutside the United States, economic activity strengthened last year, and at present global growth seems to be on a good track. The economies of our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico, appear to be expanding at a solid pace. Especially significant have been signs that Japan could be emerging from its protracted slump and its battle with deflation. In the euro area, expansion has been somewhat modest by global standards, but recent indicators suggest that growth could be strengthening there as well. Economies in emerging Asia generally continue to expand strongly. In particular, growth in China remained vigorous in 2005. \\nExpanding foreign economic activity helped drive a vigorous advance in U.S. exports in 2005, while the growth of real imports slowed. Nonetheless, the nominal U.S. trade deficit increased further last year, exacerbated in part by a jump in the value of imported petroleum products that almost wholly reflected the sharply rising price of crude oil. \\nSurging energy prices also were the dominant factor influencing U.S. inflation last year. For the second year in a row, overall consumer prices, as measured by the chain-type index for personal consumption expenditures, rose about 3 percent. Prices of consumer energy products jumped more than 20 percent, with large increases in prices of natural gas, gasoline, and fuel oil. Food prices, however, rose only modestly. And core consumer prices (that is, excluding food and energy) increased a moderate 1.9 percent. \\nThe relatively benign performance of core inflation despite the steep increases in energy prices can be attributed to several factors. Over the past few decades, the U.S. economy has become significantly less energy intensive. Also, rapid advances in productivity as well as increases in nominal wages and salaries that, on balance, have been moderate have restrained unit labor costs in recent years. \\nAnother key factor in keeping core inflation low has been confidence on the part of the public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve\\'s effort to promote price stability. And, thus far, the news has been good: Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to the larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part, they were low and stable last year. Inflation compensation for the period five to ten years ahead, derived from spreads between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, has remained well anchored. \\nRestrained inflation expectations have also been an important reason that long-term interest rates have remained relatively low. At roughly 4-1/2 percent at year-end, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury issues increased only slightly on balance over 2005 even as short-term rates rose 2 percentage points. As previous reports and testimonies from the Federal Reserve indicated, a decomposition of long-term nominal yields into spot and forward rates suggests that it is primarily the far-forward components that account for the low level of long rates. The premiums that investors demand as compensation for the risk of unforeseen changes in real interest rates and inflation appear to have declined significantly over the past decade or so. Given the more stable macroeconomic climate in the United States and in the global economy since the mid-1980s, some decline in risk premiums is not surprising. In addition, though, investors seem to expect real interest rates to remain relatively low. Such a view is consistent with a hypothesis I offered last year--that, in recent years, an excess of desired global saving over the quantity of global investment opportunities that pay historically normal returns has forced down the real interest rate prevailing in global capital markets. \\nInflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve\\'s mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve\\'s other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates. \\nAs always, however, translating the Federal Reserve\\'s general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator, or even a small set of such indicators, can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy. \\nRather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers, and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world, and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance--conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors, including myriad global influences, at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight to the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong. \\nDuring the nearly three years that I previously spent as a member of the Board of Governors and of the Federal Open Market Committee, the approach to policy that I have just outlined was standard operating procedure under the highly successful leadership of Chairman Greenspan. As I indicated to the Congress during my confirmation hearing, my intention is to maintain continuity with this and the other practices of the Federal Reserve in the Greenspan era. I believe that, with this approach, the Federal Reserve will continue to contribute to the sound performance of the U.S. economy in the years to come. \\nFebruary 2006 Monetary policy report CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you all very much.  I’ll try to say more later, but I’m not sure I can make it.  [Laughter]  Item 1 on the agenda is just basically for me to turn it over to Roger Ferguson to do as he sees fit.  [Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you very much.  I will do what is right.  [Laughter]  Let me open the floor now for nominations for a Chairman and a Vice Chairman of this Committee.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  For the day. MR. FERGUSON.  Now, you’ll see what happens.  [Laughter]  Don’t presume anything.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  I move that the Committee elect Alan Greenspan as its Chairman to serve for the remainder of today and Timothy Geithner as its Vice Chairman to serve until the election of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2007. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you very much.  Is there a second? PARTICIPANT.  Second. MR. FERGUSON.  Fine.  Is there any discussion?  Is there any objection?  Hearing none, it is unanimous.  Congratulations.  [Laughter]  Before democracy moves too quickly, [laughter] we also have to move to plan for the election of a new Chairman.  So let me, again, turn to Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Governor Ferguson.  I further move that the Committee conduct a notation vote upon the swearing-in of a new Chairman of the Board of Governors to elect Alan Greenspan’s successor as Chairman of this Committee. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you.  Is there a second?  I do need a second on that. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you very much.  Any objection?  Any discussion?  None.  So we will plan to do as Governor Kohn has suggested and hold a notation vote when a new Chairman is sworn in for the Board of Governors.  Mr. Chairman, I now turn the floor back to you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don’t you continue on with the staff while you’re in full swing? MR. FERGUSON.  Well, I’m actually not in full swing, because I don’t have the documents in front of me.  [Laughter]   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don’t you read that? MS. DANKER.  As Secretary and Economist, Vincent Reinhart; as Deputy Secretary, Debbie Danker; as Assistant Secretaries, Dave Skidmore and Michelle Smith; as General Counsel, Scott Alvarez; as Deputy General Counsel, Tom Baxter; as Economists, Karen Johnson and Dave Stockton; as Associate Economists from the Board, Tom Connors, Steve Kamin, Brian Madigan, Sandy Struckmeyer, and David Wilcox; as Associate Economists from the Banks, Bob Eisenbeis, John Judd, Mark Sniderman, Joe Tracy, and John Weinberg. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you.  I need someone to move those names for election. PARTICIPANT.  So moved. MR. FERGUSON.  A second? SEVERAL.  Second. MR. FERGUSON.  Any discussion?  Any objection?  So, again, those are elected unanimously.  Congratulations. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We also have to designate the Chief FOIA Officer.  Thanks to a recent executive order, the FOMC is required to appoint a Chief FOIA Officer.  The consensus mandatory, to designate Debbie Danker, or her successor, as the FOMC’s Chief FOIA Officer, with authority to “subdelegate” duties as appropriate.  And we stipulate that the addition of that word, which is not legally required, be expunged from the record!  [Laughter]  Without objection. The next item is the proposed revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.  Proposed additions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information reflect:  (1) incorporation of the Board’s new rules on access to confidential information by noncitizens, (2) a minor adjustment to align the program with the clause in the foreign currency authorization, and (3) a statement of the Chairman’s powers to make exceptions, which had been inadvertently trimmed in last year’s rewriting.  Would somebody like to move? PARTICIPANT.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without exception.  Our next item is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.  My notes say that New York is again the odds-on favorite.  [Laughter]  I’m always going with the odds-on favorite.  I would suggest that, unless somebody moves, I will do so and assume it’s effectively implemented.  Without objection, so ordered. Next, selection of a Manager of the System Open Market Account.  Dino Kos is the incumbent.  And on the presumption that he is acceptable to the New York Bank, he then becomes the candidate for Manager of the System Open Market Account.  Would somebody like to move the nomination? MR. FERGUSON.  I’ll move that nomination. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Now, as to the authorization for Desk operations—why don’t you take over and propose it? I’m recommending that the Committee approve it.  There are no amendments that are being suggested. MR. FERGUSON.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection. MR. KOS.  Okay.  Thank you.  Then, the next vote is on the foreign currency authorization, the foreign currency directive, and the procedural instructions.  In the memo that I circulated, there was one small amendment that I am suggesting to the authorization, having to do with some housekeeping language related to reverse repos, to bring it into alignment with domestic operations.  It’s a purely housekeeping item. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  President Lacker has expressed his intention to uphold the Richmond tradition of voting against both the foreign currency authorization and the directive.  [Laughter]  But he remains in favor of the procedural instructions.  So lacking Lacker, are there any objections?  [Laughter]  Would you like time to— MR. LACKER.  Very respectfully, Mr. Chairman, I’d like to vote against the foreign currency operation authorization.  Those of you who were here when my predecessor registered a similar dissent three years ago, and three years before that, should be familiar with the reasoning.  For those of you who were not here then, the case is very simple.  Sterilized intervention can’t possibly be more than fleetingly effective unless it serves as a signal regarding future monetary policy operations.  To the extent that such interventions are seen as providing such a signal, we risk confusing the public regarding future monetary policy and threaten to compromise our independence.  And to the extent that such interventions do not signal future policy support and thus is desirable.  So very, very respectfully, Mr. Chairman, I will decline to support the authorization. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further discussion on this issue?  Would you like to— PARTICIPANT.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without other objection—noting, of course, that the Richmond Bank is dissenting.  Dino Kos.  MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With the start of the new year, domestic participants in 2005.  How much longer would the tightening cycle continue?  What is the shape of the yield curve telling us?  Are there signs of a slowdown?  And are inflation pressures increasing, or are they likely to ebb?  The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the three-month rate three and nine months forward in red since June 2005.  As the began to converge in recent weeks.  With three- and nine-month forwards essentially trading on top of each other, and allowing for term premiums, taken at face value forward rates suggest some more modest tightening but also some probability of an ease later this year.  Those market participants that are bearish on interest rates and the economy point to data hinting at softness, such as signs of a slowdown in housing.  The bleak view was given a lift on Friday by the weaker-than-forecast fourth-quarter GDP report.  These market participants see either a quick end to the tightening cycle or a swift reversal toward policy easing later this year.  The counter view is that inflationary pressures will forestall an early end to the tightening, much less usher in a new easing cycle.  Ironically those with that view took comfort from the price data in Friday’s GDP report.    The compression we see in cash and forward rates at the short end of the curve is also visible for longer maturities.  The middle panel graphs the target fed funds rate in green along with yields on two- and ten-year Treasury notes.  Yields have slowly been grinding upward the past few days toward 4½ percent as the market, on balance, has come to discount further tightening beyond today’s meeting.  In the past week, the yield on the two-year note has risen from about 4.35 percent to 4.5 percent.  Given the mixed data, it’s difficult to make the case that the upward move was driven by data alone.  Indeed, for the first time in a while, traders were talking about looming supply given fiscal needs. Yesterday the Treasury announced a somewhat higher-than-expected borrowing need for the first quarter.  And at last week’s two-year auction, the low level of participation by indirect bidders was taken as a signal 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). the view that yields are too low given the likely prospect that the cost of financing positions will continue to rise at least a while longer.    With the convergence of yields along the curve, last summer’s chatter about yield curve inversions flared up anew.  The bottom panel graphs two views of the yield curve going back to 1977.  The red line graphs the spread between the ten-year note and the three-month bill.  The blue line graphs the yield spread between the ten-year and the two-year notes.  These are monthly averages, and the last data point is from  Looking at this chart and similar charts, it’s easy to see why the curve flattening has received so much attention.  In recent decades, recessions have tended to be preceded by curve inversions.  Of course, markets are now so much more developed and sophisticated that maybe it’s different this time.  Changes in markets, such as the role of pension funds or central bank reserve accumulation, may be distorting the curve.  And maybe that argument is right.  But a cautionary point is in order.  After all, the inversion in 2000 was dismissed by most analysts as technically inspired given the shrinking stock of federal debt and the Treasury’s buyback program at the long end of the curve.  On the other hand, the pessimists may be overplaying their hand too early in the game.  We haven’t had much of an inversion as yet.  You need a magnifying glass to see the inversion, which is very small and so far very brief.  The curve has merely gone flat.  As I noted last summer, the curve can be flat for years—as was the case in the late 1990s—without adverse effects on the broader economy.  The Chairman has talked about the conundrum, which most private-sector commentators have used as a jumping off point to talk about low nominal yields at the long end of the curve.  Until recently, less attention was focused on trends in real rates both here and abroad.   The top of page 2 graphs the yield of ten-year inflation-linked securities for the United States, the United Kingdom, and France for the past seven months.  The ten-year TIPS yield in the United States (the green line) has traded at about 2 percent.  That’s up from about 1 percent briefly observed in 2004 but well below the 4 percent earlier in this decade, when the market was still maturing.  U.K. and French real rates have also fallen since the beginning of the decade.  The United Kingdom probably has the most developed inflation-linked market, with maturities going as far out as fifty years.  The middle panel graphs the real rate on ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year inflation-linked bonds since September 2005.  Note that thirty- and fifty-year yields have gone down faster than the yields at the ten-year maturity.  The fifty-year real yield traded below ½ percent, and the fifty-year security issued just last week traded under 40 basis points.  What accounts for such low rates?  Well maybe institutions are worried about the United Kingdom’s long-term inflation prospects.  But that does not seem to be borne out by anecdotal or other indicators.  Two intertwined trends in the United Kingdom related to the insurance and pension fund businesses are frequently cited.  First, after lowered allocations to equity and shifted toward fixed income.  Second, in the United Kingdom, pension rules now require fund managers to match the duration of liabilities with similar-duration assets.  But the shortage of supply relative to demand has pushed bond prices up and yields down.  As a result, the very long end of the U.K. real yield curve has been inverted.  The long end of the nominal curve, as shown in the bottom left panel, has also inverted.  To fill out the picture, the bottom right panel graphs ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year break-even rates; but given the distortions, it’s not clear how much should be read into these numbers.  Such movements in U.K. real yields have caught the attention of U.S. portfolio managers. With continued talk about the prospect for changes to pension fund rules here, there are those who believe that the United States will gravitate toward the U.K. approach of requiring the matching of duration for assets and liabilities.  If so, then the prospect of a steady bid for long-dated assets may both damp yield volatility at the long end and lower yields from what they might have been.  That would truly make the curve very suspect as an indicator of future economic performance.   If the shape of the U.S. yield curve is bearish for the economy, there is no shortage of indicators pointing the other way.  I will note that in 2000, when the curve last inverted, the stock market soon slumped, credit spreads began a sudden widening, and the dollar was appreciating.  In this cycle, these other indicators are not flashing warning lights just yet.  The dollar tripped up many forecasters in 2005 by appreciating.  But as shown in the top panel on page 3, more recently the dollar has depreciated against most currencies, including a few Asian currencies whose exchange rates against the dollar had been somewhat sticky in the past.  Equities have been rallying globally, especially in countries leveraged to the global economy, such as Korea in technology and Brazil in commodities.  Even the Nikkei has recovered from its Livedoor-inspired swoon and the curtailment of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange due to problems in processing large volumes.  Credit markets continue to be favorable.  As shown in the bottom left chart, the volatility on the S&P 100 rose from very low levels recently but has already come back.  And Treasury volatility—shown on the bottom right—is low and recently has drifted still lower.   Moving to page 4, the top panel graphs the high-yield and emerging market debt spreads.  These two spreads essentially moved together for several years and were viewed as being of similar riskiness.  As shown in the top panel, there was a divergence in mid-2004 when emerging-market yields blew out about 150 basis points.  In mid-2005, the divergence cut the other way, with emerging markets outperforming and spreads narrowing to new record lows.  While some commentators ascribed the narrowing of emerging-market debt to the search for yield, rising risk appetite, and “excess liquidity,” others pointed to improving fundamentals driven by higher commodity prices, better fiscal performance, lower inflation, and higher reserve levels that insulated these countries from external shocks.  The pie charts below attempt to explain, if not justify, the benign explanation.  The two middle pie charts show the ratings distribution of the high-yield index as of October 2002 and again as of year-end 2005.  The rating distribution of the high-yield index is nearly of the emerging-market index as of the same two dates.  Note that the share of higher-rated BBB or investment-grade assets in blue grew from 29 to 38 percent.  Meanwhile, the share of low-rated B and CCC paper, which accounted for 33 percent of the index in October 2002, shrunk to only 11 percent at year-end.    In short, the ratings composition is higher for the emerging-market index relative to the high-yield index in absolute terms, and the trend has been toward relative ratings improvement.  Of course, ratings are not the only factor.  In a default situation, bondholders of a corporation can often assert their rights and recover meaningful amounts in a bankruptcy process overseen by the courts.  In contrast, while countries have the power to tax, the ability of the creditors in a default to recover in negotiations—as we saw with Argentina—may not be as favorable.   Finally, a few words about domestic reserves management.  On page 5, the top panel graphs the fed funds target in blue, the highs and lows for each day in gray, and the daily effective rate in red.  You’ll note that, although the effective rate was generally close to the target in the maintenance period that covered the year-end, there was a bit more variability of rates, usually late in the day, with some tendency for rates to soften.  Part of this was related to normal year-end noise.  Note also the drift higher in the effective rate ahead of the December FOMC meeting.  This reflected the market’s anticipation of the new target rate and the tendency to move the funds rate from the old to the new target rate days before the meeting.  The middle panel looks at this phenomenon more closely.  It graphs the difference between the market (effective) rate and the target fed funds rates in the days before an FOMC meeting.  To make a cleaner comparison, the sample includes only those periods in which the FOMC meeting fell on the first Tuesday of the two-week reserve maintenance period and periods in which there were no high-payment days through the meeting date that might have influenced market conditions.  It should be noted that, in all these maintenance periods, the market had come to fully expect a 25 basis point tightening move by the start of the period.  The blue line shows, for the 2004 sample dates, the drift higher in the funds rate as the FOMC meeting date gets closer.  On average, the funds rate was about 7 basis points firm on the Thursday preceding the meeting and rose to be 21 basis points firm to the old target on the Tuesday meeting date itself.  In our 2005 sample, the anticipation effect was even more pronounced in the days ahead of the meeting, with the funds rate 15 basis points firm on the Thursday and the expected move almost fully priced in on the day before the meeting.   The bottom panel underscores the difficulty that the Desk faces when it tries to lean against expectations that are so widely held.  This graph shows, for the same sample of periods, the amount of average excess reserves in the days leading up to the FOMC meeting.  It also shows what more-typical levels of excess reserves look like over the first four days of a maintenance period, based on reserve levels from periods in 2004 and 2005 in which there was no policy change and in which there were no much higher levels of excess reserves than normal in the days leading up to the FOMC meeting during these periods, in order to mitigate the anticipation effects.  And these anticipation effects became even more pronounced in 2005, despite our having increased the levels of excess reserves even further.  We tend to believe that the higher anticipation effects seen in 2005 reflected a learning process on the part of sellers tested their ability to arbitrage their reserve holdings over more days in the maintenance period around the expected policy change.  It’s not clear what the natural limit is to this process.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to report once again that there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  Debby and I are happy to take any questions.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’d like to go back to the British experience, which I think is intriguing in a number of different respects.  The United Kingdom has TIPS-type issues going out fifty years.  What do they index the fifty-year maturity to, incidentally? MR. KOS.  It’s the RPIX. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So it’s not terribly dissimilar to ours.  But what I think is really quite fascinating is that these relationships are largely demographically driven.  In other words, the question is essentially that, if we’re heading into a society in which an ever-increasing proportion of the people are retired, then you have some real pressure to fund—which we don’t do but everyone else should.  Let’s put it this way:  Every pension theoretician will tell you there is no problem with pensions.  All you have to do is make the appropriate maturity matches.  And if you get a big surge in potential retirees, the demand for longer-term issues goes up, which we take as a given. But this is the first evidence—at least that I’ve been able to see—that this is an overwhelming force because, irrespective of the other forces that drive the long-term rates, the spread between the thirty-year and the fifty-year is really quite pronounced.  And it is suggesting that it cannot be an economic forecast.  We have enough trouble forecasting nine months.  wholly random variable.  And so it has to be the demographics.  And what the demographics are telling us is that the issue is large enough to essentially dominate the longer end of the markets.  This suggests to me that the thirty-year, which we struggled to get rid of and is now coming back, suggests that there is a very heavy demand in thirty-year forwards, all of which will tend to depress the thirty-year yield if we don’t have a greater maturity.  And there will be market pressures to de-link that whole thirty-year plus back onto the issue. I was wondering whether or not this subject is engaging the Street because I’ve been puzzled by the tranches of the thirty-year issue, which mature from 2020 on, when the fiscal problems in the United States seemingly mount potential instability—which is another way of saying that these pressures may overwhelm the economics.  At least they are doing so in Britain.  And the question is, do you think we’re going to be replicating Britain’s experience? MR. KOS.  Well, my reason for including this detail at the meeting really is because that’s the anecdotal feedback that I’ve been getting over the past few weeks and months.  And, in a sense, the U.K. experience caught a lot of portfolio managers here by surprise, and it has made them rethink their assumptions about the effect that a change in pension rules would have on our long end.  And that, I think, is exactly the point that you’re making. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But if we know that there has always been this presumption, well, it can’t be large enough to have an effect. MR. KOS.  I think what we’ve learned from the U.K. case is that it can be.  In a sense, the thirty-year gilt in the United Kingdom became disengaged from the rest of the curve some years ago.  And we had an upward-sloping curve to about ten, and then it became inverted because of rules would do to the shape of the curve.  What will be the demographics that will drive it?  And it’s making them rethink their assumptions about demand driven by demographics, as you say, versus other kinds of demands that might increase supply because of fiscal factors.  So you might get an ironic effect in which you’ll get more supply but the demand is even higher because of what’s happening. MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, may I make three points?  The first is that I would underscore what Dino said.  A great event study occurred when the prudent-man law in the United Kingdom changed, and you saw longer-term yields fall as a result because pension managers had to go out further on the curve. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What was the date of that? MR. REINHART.  Around 1998.  Second, as you know, in the discussion with the Treasury, we actually tried very hard to convince them to go to thirty and then to go beyond.  But that’s a very slow-moving boat.  Third, real long-term securities are very convex in return.  So just because of the arithmetic of the yield curve, you would think that the fifty-year yield should be below the thirty-year, as the thirty-year is below the twenty-year.  So in an environment of uncertainty about future yields, it isn’t that surprising. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, what happened to the term premium? MR. REINHART.  In fact, the yield curve is a competition between two factors in uncertainty.  Because of uncertainty, the term premium itself should march up at approximately linearly in maturity. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It gets overwhelmed by the arithmetic. pulling down yields.  That’s why typically the thirty-year yield is below the twenty-year yield.  When you get out to the fifty-year, then the effect of convexity is even more pronounced. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When we were doing the analysis of the change in the term premium, since we know the convexity characteristics and we know what the longer-term rates are, were we able to infer part of our analysis from the longer-term elements?  That’s the only thing we really add. MR. REINHART.  Sure.  For instance, when the United Kingdom first issued a fifty-year security, we priced what a fifty-year maturity would be in the United States.  And it was well below the thirty-year and not that dissimilar to what actually happened.  So partly it is just that, because bonds are in price and that’s what people care about but we quote yields, the effect of convexity is going to pull down longer-term yields. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Going back to the Chairman’s question on size, Dino, the press and many analysts focus on central bank reserves when they talk about what’s buffeting intermediate-term rates.  If you talk to Barclays, they give you awfully big numbers of potential dedicated moneys on the pension side, an order of magnitude of, say, multiples of six or seven times what central bank reserves are.  Could we study the potential size that’s at play here?  And, of course, the United Kingdom is not just dedicated to U.K. fixed-income instruments.  They’re also looking at our fixed-income instruments at the longer end of the curve.  So getting a sense of dimension here, if possible, might assist this conversation.  I think that this is very, very important. very important, is that it’s not just U.S. managers looking at U.S. TIPS but European managers looking at U.S. inflation-linked securities.  It’s a very good point.  I think it’s worth studying. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I just wanted to note that I meet on Monday mornings before Open hear what they’re hearing in the markets.  They are very much on the same wave length that you were, Mr. Chairman, in feeling that the flatness of the yield curve was largely due to the desire for long-dated securities in the pension fund arena to better match assets and liabilities and that it was not at all, or at least not in major part, a comment about the economy but more a function of institutional and market demand for these long-dated securities.  Now, I don’t know whether they think that the legislation now in the Congress is going to pass, but they seem to be very focused on the fact that they need more longer-dated securities and that supplies of the thirty-year would, in effect, create more demand for the thirty-year.   CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The legislation really is irrelevant.  The problem here is that a set of liabilities is being created by the steepness of the retirement curve, and there is an obvious requirement to fund that set.  But the bill in the Congress is trying to play games with the type of discount rate that companies can use.  The only real discount factor that fund managers can use, if they seriously believe that what they are promising is to be guaranteed, is to put pension funds in U.S. Treasuries and to tranch them in a manner that exactly meets the maturity requirements.  That situation, therefore, has nothing to do with what the piece of legislation is and everything to do with the rate of change of the population over 65. frame the problem in the context of increasing pressure from the outside. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In other words, whether that bill passes or not, the pressures to fund these liabilities are going to increase, especially after the baby-boom generation starts to retire and fund managers look at the size of it. MR. KOS.  I have heard a few anecdotes regarding CEOs who have been very surprised and become angry when they saw that their unfunded pension fund cost them earnings over the past few years.  They basically directed the CFO and, in turn, the pension managers not to let this happen again.  Thus, regardless of legislation, there has been a shift at the margin from equities into debt with matching duration. MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.  That’s certainly what the fund managers were saying. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair, would you move to ratify? VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Would you like to make an economic presentation, Dave? MR. STOCKTON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A few years back, I noted that my briefings could largely be characterized as a collection of confessions and excuses.  This morning I would like to add a new element to that list:  denial.  As you know, the BEA’s advance estimate for the growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter—shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit—came in last Friday at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, about half the pace that we had projected.  But at this point, we don’t believe that this estimate should be taken as a signal that the economy has fundamentally weakened.  To be sure, after a first round of sorting through the details of that report, we haven’t found a smoking gun that gives us any strong reason to override the BEA’s estimate.  But we have assumed that there will be a bounceback in some areas that were surprisingly weak last quarter, most notably motor vehicle output and federal spending. As we see it, the recent configuration of data suggests that, to the extent that there was any noticeable weakness in the fourth quarter, it was short-lived, and we are 2 The materials used by Messrs. Stockton, Struckmeyer, and Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). panel, after spiking up this autumn, initial claims quickly returned to pre-hurricane levels and have dropped even further in recent weeks, giving no suggestion of any softening in the labor market.  Industrial production (line 1 of the middle left panel) actually peaked in the fourth quarter, driven by a sharp acceleration in manufacturing output (line 2).  Moreover, as shown to the right, recent manufacturing surveys are supportive of our forecast of moderate gains in production as we move into the new year.  Consumer spending and capital outlays have also remained solid.  Setting aside the effects of the large swings in motor vehicle purchases that occurred in the second half of last year, consumer spending, shown in the bottom left panel, has been on a steady uptrend.  And yesterday’s reading on real PCE excluding motor vehicles in nondefense capital goods (plotted as the red line in the bottom right panel) were released last week after the Greenbook was published, and they were stronger than we had projected.  Moreover, new orders (the black line) have remained above shipments, suggesting that equipment spending should be buoyant in coming months.   The top left panel of your next exhibit lays out our longer-term outlook for real GDP.  As seen by the blue bars, the growth of real GDP is projected to step up this year to 3.9 percent before falling back to 3 percent in 2007.  That pattern is influenced importantly by our assumed hurricane effects, and as shown by the red bars, aside from those effects we are expecting a gradual deceleration in activity over the next two years.  Our inflation projection is shown to the right.  Overall PCE prices are expected to decelerate over the next two years as consumer energy prices slow sharply.  We continue to expect a small bump-up in core inflation this year as higher prices for energy, nonfuel imports, and commodity prices are passed through into the prices of final goods and services.  But we expect core inflation to edge back down in 2007 as these influences abate.  Although this story is pretty much the same as the one in December, we did have, in addition to last Friday’s GDP excitement, a few other developments to deal with over the intermeeting period.  As shown in the middle left panel, crude oil prices rose further in recent weeks and are now projected to average $6.50 per barrel higher than in the December Greenbook.  As Nathan will be discussing shortly, we also revised up a bit our projection for foreign activity, lowered our projection for the dollar, and—as shown in the middle right panel—raised our forecast for nonfuel import prices.  With oil and imports providing a little more upward pressure on costs, we nudged up our forecast for core PCE prices this year and, along with it, our fed funds assumption over the next year—plotted as the black line in the bottom left.  We made no substantive changes to our fiscal policy assumptions.  As shown in the bottom right panel, fiscal policy provides some impetus to activity this year, related largely to hurricane spending and the implementation of the prescription drug benefit, but is expected to be a nearly neutral influence next year.  The principal source of slowing in aggregate activity in our forecast continues to be the housing sector, the subject of exhibit 3.  The accumulating data have made us more confident, though far from certain, that we are reaching an inflection point in the housing boom.  The bigger question now is whether we will experience the gradual cooling that we are projecting or a more pronounced downturn.  I’ll be interested to hear your reports this morning.  As for the recent data, sales of existing homes (the red line in the top left panel) have dropped sharply in recent months and by more than we had expected.  New home sales (the black line) have also moved off their peaks of last summer but are more consistent with our expectation of a gradual softening.  That expectation receives some further support from the more-timely mortgage bankers’ purchase index—plotted to the right.  Purchase applications also are off their highs but are not indicating any sharp retrenchment through January.   With respect to house prices, the recent data and anecdotes also have pointed to some weakening.  As a result, our forecast of a sharp deceleration in home prices—shown in the middle left panel—seems less of a stretch than it did a while back.  As shown to the right, the bottom line is that, after contributing importantly to the growth of real GDP over the past four years, residential investment is expected to decelerate sharply this year and to turn down a bit in 2007.  As we have noted before, our house-price forecast also has implications for consumer spending.  Slower growth of house prices is the chief factor causing the wealth-to-income ratio (the black line in the bottom left panel) to drift down over the projection period.  That downdrift, along with the lagged reaction to higher interest rates, results in a gradual rise in the personal saving rate over the next two years.  As shown to the right, although spending growth falls short of that of income, overall PCE receives considerable support from the strong gains in disposable income that result from the projected flattening of energy prices, ongoing employment gains, and a step-up in the pace of hourly compensation.  Business investment is the subject of exhibit 4.  Spending on equipment and software, plotted as the black line in the top left panel, slows gradually over the projection period, largely because the accelerator effects that propelled the earlier recovery in capital outlays begin to wane.  Nevertheless, with the cost of capital remaining moderate and corporate balance sheets strong, we are forecasting solid increases in real E&S spending this year and next.  Our projection for total nonresidential structures, shown in the panel to the right, reflects some divergent patterns in the components.  We expect outlays for drilling and mining (line 2) to increase sharply further this year in response to the run-up that has occurred in the prices for crude oil and natural gas.  Although those prices are expected to level off, the lagged effects of the earlier gains should result in some further, albeit diminished, increase in drilling activity in 2007.  Excluding drilling and mining (line 3) we are projecting a modest recovery in nonresidential construction activity in response to ongoing gains in employment and gradually declining vacancy rates in the office and industrial sectors. One of the reasons that we are reasonably optimistic about the investment outlook is that the total return to capital—plotted in the middle left panel—remains quite favorable.  And although we expect that return to recede a bit as labor costs pick up, it would still remain elevated by historical standards over the forecast period.  The remainder of the exhibit is something of a going-away present to the Chairman.  While he always seemed to have a grip on where productivity was headed in the future, we always seemed to be struggling to explain what had happened in the past.  Most recently, those struggles have centered on understanding the continuing strong gains in productivity in the first half of this decade.  One important element of our story has been that the investment boom of the late 1990s was at least partly responsible for sowing the seeds of the further acceleration in multifactor productivity that we have experienced this decade.  That capital equipment embodied rapidly improving technologies and allowed firms to sometimes radically restructure business processes.  More broadly, as adjustment costs associated with absorbing those investments waned, the productivity advantages showed through more clearly.   The bottom panel provides some modest support for the proposition that some of the improved performance of multifactor productivity of the first half of the decade can be traced to the earlier investment boom.  That panel employs a new data set based on research spearheaded by my colleagues Carol Corrado, Paul Lengermann, and Larry Slifman that calculates multifactor productivity for detailed industries.  Along the x-axis, we measure for each of 60 industries the average rate of growth in investment over the 1995-to-2000 period relative to that industry’s historical norm.  On the y-axis, we plot the acceleration in MFP experienced by each industry from the 1995-to-2000 period to the 2000-to-2004 period.  As seen by the red regression line, those industries for which the growth of equipment and software was unusually high in the late 1990s were more likely than others to experience a subsequent acceleration in multifactor productivity in the first part of this decade.  Obviously, this is not a structural relationship and is meant to be impressionistic.  But the recovery in equipment spending over the past few years leaves us optimistic that multifactor productivity can continue to grow at a rapid clip, though perhaps not quite at the pace registered over the first half of the decade.  Sandy will now continue our presentation.  MR. STRUCKMEYER.  Your next two exhibits detail the supply-side assumptions of the staff forecast, starting with the projection of structural labor productivity.  In our analysis, structural labor productivity growth is defined as the increment to labor productivity that can be sustained over time.  It is a medium- to long-run concept that attempts to eliminate the bulk of the cyclical influences on productivity growth.  As shown on the top right, structural labor productivity growth can, in turn, be decomposed into the contributions from capital deepening, labor quality, and structural multifactor productivity growth.    As indicated in the middle left panel, the recovery that has occurred in the level of business capital spending over the past four years translates into a pickup in the years of 1995 to 2000.  The contribution of capital deepening to structural productivity growth—that is, the product of the growth in capital services per hour and the capital share of output—picks up gradually over the next two years.  Note in the middle right panel that the bulk of this contribution comes from investments in information technology—as has been the case for all of this decade.   In contrast, the pace of growth in structural multifactor productivity—shown in the bottom left—has greatly exceeded the pace over the 1995 to 2000 period.  This is just the manifestation at the aggregate level of the driving forces shown in Dave’s scatter plot.  However, we have allowed for slightly slower growth in 2006 and 2007 than in the preceding years as the marginal gains from additional organizational improvements and embodied technical change begin to wane.  In addition, as noted in the right, we’ve seen some leveling-off in expenditures on research and development lately, which may well manifest itself in a somewhat slower pace of technological change in the years ahead.  Your next exhibit presents our estimates of potential output growth.  As shown on line 1, we expect potential real GDP to expand at a 3¼ percent pace over the next two years.  As you can see on line 2, total potential hours worked—or trend labor input—is expected to slow somewhat.  Although population growth is expected to be well maintained, the trends in both labor force participation and the average workweek are offsetting factors.  As we’ve noted before, the downtrend in the labor force participation rate (shown in the middle left) mainly reflects the changing demographic composition of the workforce.  The estimated trend in the workweek (in the middle right panel) shifted down in 2001—reflecting the introduction of NAICS in the payroll survey—and is expected to fall at about the same pace in 2006 and 2007 as it has since 2001.  The implications of these supply-side assumptions for the labor market are shown in the bottom two panels.  Although nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase briskly in the near term, we expect gains to slow progressively over the next two years, reflecting the moderation in the pace of economic growth and the slower growth in the potential labor force that I just described.  Indeed, we expect trend payroll growth to average only 100,000 per month over the next two years.  As shown on the bottom right, the unemployment rate holds fairly steady this year and next.  Given the pace of economic growth last year, our model of Okun’s law was surprised by the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate—the gap between the red and black lines.  We are expecting this error to be worked off over the course of this year, and in 2007 the unemployment rate moves in sync with the Okun’s law simulation.   Your next exhibit presents the outlook for the growth in labor compensation.  In the January Greenbook, we projected hourly compensation, as measured by both the ECI and P&C compensation per hour, to accelerate over the next two years.  We think that continued strong growth in structural labor productivity will elevate wage demands, while labor market slack will be a relatively neutral influence on have allowed for some pass-through into wages of the higher price inflation in 2004 and 2005.    This morning’s reading on the ECI showed that hourly compensation in private industry increased 3 percent in the 12 months ending in December—the same as the judgmental projection in the January Greenbook.  However, as you can see in the bottom left, our econometric equation for the ECI has overpredicted the actual growth in compensation since the middle of 2004, possibly suggesting that our estimated NAIRU of 5 percent is too high.  In looking at the range of econometric wage and price models that we follow, the evidence on a change in the NAIRU is mixed.  We have noted a tendency for some models to overpredict inflation lately.  But as shown in the bottom right, the random nature (and the smaller absolute size) of the errors from one of our better reduced-form price equations does not yet suggest the need to lower our estimate of the NAIRU.  I will return to the implications of this assumption later in my remarks.   Your next exhibit presents the outlook for inflation.  Recent readings on headline inflation (shown in the top left) have remained at the high end of the elevated range that has prevailed since 2004.  Those readings reflect mainly the direct effects of higher energy prices, which have increased at an average pace of 20 percent per year over the past two years.  In contrast, we have seen some moderation in the pace of core consumer price inflation, with the twelve-month change in both the core PCE and the core CPI indexes slowing to about 2 percent.    Looking ahead, we have had to cope with somewhat greater pressures on inflation in this Greenbook.  These pressures stem mainly from the upward revisions to our projections of crude oil prices and core nonfuel import prices that Dave discussed.  As a result of these changes, the moderation in PCE energy prices is somewhat less than in past Greenbooks, and we anticipate greater spillovers on the prices of other industrial materials (shown in the middle right).  On net, we expect core PCE prices (line 4 in the bottom left panel) to increase 2¼ percent this year before decelerating to 1¾ percent in 2007 as the influence of these cost shocks recedes.  The bottom right panel shows two alternative simulations that address key risks to the inflation outlook.  The adverse shocks simulation assumes that the economy is hit with additional increases in the prices of oil, non-oil imports, and industrial materials that match those that prevailed in 2004.  Under the assumption that the funds rate remains on its baseline path, core PCE inflation moves up to about 2½ percent in 2006 and 2007 (the red line).  In contrast, as I noted earlier, our estimate of the NAIRU may be too high, and a second simulation examines the implications of a 4¼ percent NAIRU—essentially one standard deviation below our current estimate.  Under this assumption, core PCE price inflation falls to 1½ percent by the end of next year.  Even though these two simulations embody some fairly large differences in assumptions from the Greenbook baseline, both simulations remain well inside a presentation.  MR. SHEETS.  Your first international exhibit focuses on the dollar.  As indicated by the red line in the top-left panel, despite widening U.S. external imbalances, the dollar rose strongly against the major currencies through much of 2005.  As seen on the top right, against the euro and the yen, the dollar has recorded net gains of more than 10 percent over the past year, even after tailing off some during the last two months.  The dollar’s rise against these currencies occurred as interest rate differentials (shown on the bottom left) moved strongly in favor of dollar assets, and market commentary has pointed to this as a key factor supporting the dollar.  Against the Canadian dollar, however, the greenback has moved down since mid-2005, and—as displayed on the bottom right—the dollar has also fallen against an array of emerging-market currencies, as market confidence in these countries has climbed.  On balance, the broad nominal dollar has strengthened about 1¾ percent over the past year.   As shown in the top panels of exhibit 10, the dollar’s resilience last year came in the context of a shift in the composition of reported U.S. financial inflows, away from official financing and toward private financing.  In 2005, foreign official inflows (line 1 on the left) were down sharply from their 2004 pace.  A plunge in official inflows from the G-10 countries (line 2) led this decline, as the Japanese authorities ceased intervening in foreign exchange markets.  In contrast, inflows from emerging Asia (line 3) continued to move up, reflecting massive reserve accumulation by China.  Purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners (the top right panel) surged last year to more than $700 billion.  All major categories of instruments saw increased foreign purchases, with particularly large gains in Treasury securities (line 2) and corporate bonds (line 4).  The positive sentiment toward the emerging market economies, which was seen in foreign exchange markets, has also been manifest in global debt markets.  As shown on the bottom left, the EMBI+ spread—which had hovered above the U.S. double-B corporate spread in recent years—cut below the double-B spread in mid-2005 and has now sunk to historical lows of just above 200 basis points.  These favorable conditions, however, have not triggered a rise in external borrowing.  As shown on the bottom right, net issuance of international debt securities by the emerging Asian economies has remained stable over the last year or two, and the Latin American countries have been paying down debt on net.  Moreover, a sizable fraction of these economies continue to run current account surpluses.  Your next exhibit focuses on the outlook for activity abroad, which in our view is quite favorable.  As shown in line 1 of the top left panel, we estimate that total foreign growth in the second half of last year climbed to 4.1 percent, as growth in the emerging market economies (line 6) exceeded 6 percent.  Going forward, we expect the foreign economies on average to expand at a strong pace of 3½ percent.  Recent particularly in Germany, as strengthening in the export sector appears to have jump-started investment.  We expect this impetus eventually to feed through to increased employment and consumer spending.  Accordingly, we have marked up our forecast for the euro area and now expect growth there to remain near the 2 percent pace posted in the second half of 2005.  Our forecast for Japan (line 4) calls for the expansion to broaden and for growth to remain above our estimate of potential.  As shown in the middle left panel, over the past decade, Japanese corporations have dramatically reduced their debt burdens (the blue line).  As balance sheets have strengthened, business investment (the black line) has risen and labor market conditions (the red line) have improved.  More recently, as shown on the right, urban land prices—after many years of sharp contraction—appear to have stopped falling, and bank credit seems to be following a similar pattern.  These developments suggest that conditions in the Japanese financial sector may finally be normalizing.  The bottom panels focus on China.  Over the intermeeting period, the Chinese authorities reported that GDP in 2004 was $280 billion (or 17 percent) larger than they had previously realized.  Given these revisions, China’s GDP last year now appears to have exceeded that of France and the United Kingdom, making China the world’s fourth-largest economy.  Other recent data indicate that China’s trade surplus (displayed on the right) jumped to $100 billion in 2005, as import growth declined sharply.  Returning to the top left panel, this deceleration in imports did not reflect a slowing in the overall pace of Chinese activity last year, as GDP growth (line 8) remained near 10 percent.  We see growth there notching down to around 7¾ percent in 2006, as the authorities are expected to implement administrative measures to restrain investment.   As displayed in the top right panel, average foreign inflation is projected to remain well contained, cycling near 2½ percent through the forecast period.  Inflation rates in the foreign industrial countries are seen to step down in mid-2006, as the run-up in oil prices plays through.   For the emerging market economies, oil price increases typically pass through into consumer prices more slowly, as a number of these countries have price controls or subsidies in place that temporarily cushion the upward pressure on prices.  As such, the rise in oil prices should continue to push up consumer price inflation through the next few quarters, but these pressures should abate in 2007.   The top panels of exhibit 12 focus on trade prices.  As shown on the left, the spot price of West Texas intermediate (the black line) has surged about $20 per barrel over the past year and now trades above $65 per barrel.  Oil prices have been driven up both by strong global demand and by concerns about the reliability and adequacy of global supplies.  Recent developments in Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria have further intensified these concerns.  Tracking futures markets, our forecast calls for the price of WTI to remain elevated through the end of 2007.  Nonfuel commodity prices (the red line) have also risen sharply over the past year, as metals prices have surged in commodity prices to flatten out near current levels, as supply responses help cap further price rises.    The center panel displays our projection for the broad real dollar.  After rising somewhat on balance last year, the dollar is projected to depreciate slightly, at an annual rate of about 1⅓ percent, through the forecast period.  We see the expanding current account deficit and associated financing concerns—as well as monetary tightening by some foreign central banks—as likely to be sources of downward pressure on the dollar.   Core import prices (the right panel) spiked in the fourth quarter, driven largely by a surge in natural gas prices following the hurricanes.  Given that natural gas prices have already retreated, the run-up in core import price inflation should quickly unwind.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, we see core import price inflation moving down to around 1 percent by early next year, consistent with flat commodity prices and only modest dollar depreciation.  Recent data on U.S. nominal trade (the bottom left panel) indicate that the trade deficit has widened further.  In October and November, exports of goods and services (line 2) increased $17 billion, led by a rise in capital goods exports (line 3), owing in part to a rebound in aircraft exports following the Boeing strike in September.  Notably, exports of industrial supplies in October and November (line 4) were down relative to the third quarter.  A large share of U.S. firms that produce these goods are located in hurricane-affected areas, and their production has been temporarily impaired.  As shown on the right, this circumstance is highlighted by a sharp drop in real exports from several industries that were particularly affected by the hurricanes.  Nominal imports of goods and services (line 6 on the table) rose a hefty $80 billion in October and November, notwithstanding soft growth in consumer goods (line 7) and capital goods (line 8).  The recent rise in imports primarily reflected large increases in industrial supplies (line 9) and oil (line 10).  These gains were due both to higher import prices, particularly for oil and natural gas, and to rising import quantities (which have substituted for impaired domestic production).  Notably, as seen on the right, real imports have risen sharply in some of the same hurricane-affected industries in which exports have been particularly weak.  As shown in the top left panel of your final international exhibit, we estimate that the growth of U.S. real exports of goods and services (the blue bars) dipped during the second half of 2005, as the hurricanes contributed to softness in goods exports and as last year’s dollar appreciation reduced the stimulus to services exports.  Imports (the red bars), in contrast, expanded at a solid rate in the second half of last year, with a boost from the hurricanes.  This pattern is expected to reverse in the first half of 2006, with exports recovering from the effects of the hurricanes and imports of oil and industrial supplies moderating.  Thereafter, imports and exports are projected to grow at comparable paces, in line with solid U.S. and foreign growth and with the panel, the contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP growth in the second half of last year is estimated to have been around negative 0.6 percentage point, but it is projected to swing slightly positive in the first half of this year.  Subsequently, the subtraction due to net exports should run at roughly ⅓ percentage point; imports and exports grow at comparable rates, but with imports more than 50 percent larger than exports, a sizable subtraction from growth results.   As shown in the middle left panel, the U.S. current account deficit widened from about $150 billion in 1997 to $780 billion in the third quarter of last year.  Over the forecast period, we see the deficit increasing further, to over $1 trillion, or about 7½ percent of GDP.  The bottom panel provides some additional perspective on the widening of the current account deficit.  As shown in the first column, from 1997:Q1 to 2001:Q4—a period of dollar appreciation—the current account balance fell $217 billion, which was more than accounted for by a decline in the non-oil trade balance.  Over the next four years (the second column), the current account balance dropped another $421 billion, largely because of a continued decline in the non-oil trade balance (despite a net depreciation of the dollar) and a sharp rise in oil imports.  As shown in the last column, we expect the current account deficit to widen nearly $300 billion over the forecast period, with all four major components contributing to the decline.  Notably, net investment income is expected to fall sharply, as growing U.S. indebtedness and rising short-term interest rates push up our payments to foreigners.   The middle right panel shows that our current account projections for 2006 and 2007 are markedly gloomier than those of other forecasters.  Thus, there is a distinct possibility that investors will be surprised by the extent that the current account deficit widens.  We see this as representing an important downside risk for the dollar.   MR. STOCKTON.  The final exhibit presents your economic projections for 2006 and 2007.  The central tendencies of those projections anticipate real GDP to increase about 3½ percent this year and then to run between 3 and 3½ percent in 2007.  Forecasts of core PCE price inflation are centered on 2 percent this year and between 1¾ and 2 percent in 2007.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to be between 4¾ and 5 percent both this year and next.  I would appreciate receiving any revisions in your forecasts by the close of business Friday.  My colleagues and I would be happy to take any questions that you might have. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In exhibit 6, the average workweek is something of a  puzzlement.  I’m curious to get a sense of what is our now retrospective explanation of the sharp fall in the year 2000-01 and the failure to start back up as the economy picked up.  Are we looking at an age or a demographic mix? classifications into the payroll survey.  So it was just a methodological change that was realized. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So, really, we never had such a drop.  The series is just discontinuous. MR. STRUCKMEYER.  It’s discontinuous.  If you look at the two slopes, they’re about the same before and after, but there is discontinuity in 2001. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We know labor force participation changes as people move into different age brackets.  So if we have data of average hours by age, do we have any judgment as to whether their average workweek hours change as well? MR. STRUCKMEYER.  Not to my knowledge.  MR. STOCKTON.  I don’t know either, Mr. Chairman.  I would suspect, though I don’t really know, that workweeks would tend to decline later in an individual’s life cycle, certainly relative to the prime age working years. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Individuals also may be more affluent so that they have an ability to actually— MR. STOCKTON.  Or affluent and more likely to be taking on part-time work in retirement.  [Laughter]  I’m not suggesting that your workweek is likely to fall; I’m sure it’s going to maintain its current level!  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I object to that!  [Laughter]  I mean, there are data by age.  Certainly in the household survey we pick up something. MR. STRUCKMEYER.  Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m just curious.  President Santomero. Greenbook, as I understand it, you’ve got housing prices going up at about a 5½ percent rate as compared with last year’s number, which I think is 12 percent.  We’ve been looking at the sensitivity of what happens to our GDP growth rate in ’06 and ’07 to the extent that housing prices stay flat.  Our numbers suggest that a flat housing price associated with the decline in residential investment would shave about ½ percentage point off GDP in ’06 and about 0.6 or 0.7 if you add the consumption effects.  Does that sound like a reasonable sensitivity to you? MR. STOCKTON.  That sounds like a reasonable sensitivity.  As you know, we have presented this effect in the past.  It’s a little larger than the effects that we get when we run our model, which would be measured more around ¼ percentage point to ½ percentage point.  Now, you may recall that last June John Williams presented some simulations of various housing-price scenarios.  Our relatively small effects come from just simulating a lower path for the price of housing, and as you know, our model has a relatively low marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth, one that is similar to that out of overall household wealth. It’s not difficult to imagine upping those effects.  If one wants to assume that, instead of the three and a half cents on the dollar effect that we have incorporated in our model, the marginal propensity to consume was around five to seven cents on the dollar, those effects would obviously be increased.  The second potential channel that our straightforward model simulations don’t account for is that a lower path for housing prices could be accompanied by some hit to consumer sentiment.  There would be an outsized effect on consumer spending if households really became more pessimistic given the downturn in what is an asset with a high profile in their portfolios.  And the third possibility that John explored in his simulations was related to one of the alternative simulations we show this time around:  If weakening in house prices and housing activity occurred on the housing-sector side, which could be amplified, but also on other forms of interest sensitive spending. So I think there are some pretty wide confidence intervals.  The numbers that you cited are bigger than our standard simulation, but seem reasonable and in the ballpark if one wants to make a few adjustments in some of the assumptions that we made.  As I contemplate our outlook and the things that I worry about the most on the domestic side of the economy, I’d say the housing sector is clearly one of the biggest risks that you’re currently confronting. MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Nathan, if you look at the differences between the Greenbook forecast of the path of the external balance and those of other forecasters, can you summarize for us what the major sources of differences are?  Are they about the exchange rate assumption, or are they about something else? MR. SHEETS.  I think the source varies from forecast to forecast.  One difference across these forecasts relative to ours is in the oil price.  The other forecasters are in the $50-$55 range, whereas we have an oil price of $65 to $70.  So that’s a piece of it.  Looking at the assumptions embedded in these forecasts pretty carefully, the one forecast that has a much sharper depreciation of the dollar than what we’ve written down is the Global Insight forecast, which shows the dollar falling quite dramatically over the next year or so.  But I don’t find significantly different assumptions about the exchange rate in the other forecasts.  So I guess the bottom line is that I think a lot of this difference is just a difference in models, and we’re confident that—if you give us an variables into a path for the current account. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, before we go to the general discussion, because of the unusual nature of this particular one-day session with various timing problems, I just calculated that, in the eighteen years I’ve been here, we’ve gone from an average presentation of three minutes to one of six minutes.  [Laughter]  The drift has been inexorably upward.  And I will suggest to you that, unless we are somewhat unusually restrained today, we’re going to run way over what our luncheon plans are, and we will be forced to call them dinner.  [Laughter]  So may I suggest, if at all possible, that you try to restrain the time that you’re employing on this particular occasion.  With those restrictions, who would like to start off?  [Laughter] MR. MOSKOW.  With restraint, Mr. Chairman, most of our contacts this round were positive about current business conditions.  However, they were cautious about the prospects for ’06, largely because they didn’t see any obvious drivers for growth. With regard to current conditions, national labor markets appear to be solid.  Both of the temporary-help firms headquartered in our District reported that their business was very good.  Of course, they mentioned that it was softer in the Midwest, primarily because of the problems of the Big Three automakers and their spillovers and because of suppliers in the regional economy.  One mentioned that Michigan was the only state in which he had seen a drop in the demand for business and technical workers.  I mentioned last time that things could get worse if the Delphi negotiations result in a strike, and all three parties—Delphi, UAW, and GM—are talking.  Delphi has toned down its rhetoric, and the deadline has now been pushed back to February 17. pace.  With regard to other costs, I heard the usual concerns about prices for energy and energy-related inputs in shipping, but the reports about other material costs were mixed.  There was one interesting case in which capacity considerations were showing up in higher prices, and that’s the airline industry.  United reported that the reduced capacity in the industry has made it easier for them to raise prices, particularly when it comes to passing through fuel costs.  And, as you know, they are scheduled to exit bankruptcy shortly. As I mentioned in the past, I’m concerned about the high amount of liquidity circulating in financial markets.  For example, one of our directors who heads a major private equity firm noted that such funds were having no trouble attracting investors.  He said that the amount of new money invested in private equity firms is expected to expand 50 percent this year, and there is a slightly ominous look to some of the new investors, such as underfunded state pension funds that are “reaching for return,” as he described it.  Similarly, early last week we held our semiannual meeting of academics and local business economists, and I heard comments about unusually high liquidity levels from several economists who work for investment firms and commercial banks.  And as we all know, risk spreads are quite low by historical standards.  So I worry that there’s a lot of money chasing investments out there, and that this may have driven the price of risk down too far. In the national outlook, even with the weak fourth-quarter numbers we continue to expect that economic activity will expand at a solid pace similar to that in the Greenbook.  We see growth at or slightly above trend over the next two years and the unemployment rate remaining around 5 percent.  Of course, if the fourth-quarter sluggishness spills forward, we would have a more complicated set of issues to deal with, but I agree with the staff and expect that growth will bounce back this quarter.  With regard to prices, we think that core PCE inflation will average close to agreed with this outlook, although a couple predicted that GDP growth would fall somewhat below 3 percent in 2006. Most of these economists thought that we would raise the fed funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent and then go on hold.  As always, we’re going to have to take a hard look at the data and forecasts before we decide what to do.  Inflation could moderate further.  We’ve been pleasantly surprised at firms’ ability to absorb cost shocks.  If they continue to do so, we could be looking at core PCE inflation rates heading down this spring.  In that event, inflation risks would be diminished, and there would be fewer risks in ending the current rate cycle.  But there’s a good chance that recent cost increases will pass through, and we’ll experience a repeat of last winter’s uptick in core inflation.  Moreover, I can see some plausible outcomes for growth that would pressure resource utilization.  And in that event, we’d be looking at a forecast for core inflation that was stuck above 2 percent.  I think this would be a problem.  With inflation remaining at such rates, we could begin to lose credibility if markets mistakenly inferred that our comfort zone had drifted higher.  When we stop raising rates, we ought to be reasonably confident that policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back toward the center of our comfort zone, which I believe is 1½ percent.  And as I read the long-run simulation in the Bluebook, it seemed to say that the funds rate needed to rise a bit over 5 percent by late 2006 to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent within a reasonable period.  So for today, we should move forward with an increase of 25 basis points, and we should allow ourselves enough flexibility so that policy can either stop or continue moving, as the situation warrants. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data on economic activity, as summarized by the fourth-quarter GDP figure, have been surprisingly weak.  But there are good Greenbook and other forecasts in expecting a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter. That said, I want to sound a note of caution.  This view is based on incomplete data for the fourth quarter and a paucity of information concerning activity in the first quarter.  It is not inconceivable that the weak numbers for the fourth quarter could presage a more-prolonged, sluggish phase as the lagged effects of past policy tightening and higher oil prices take effect.  This caution is heightened by my concern that the economy faces some pretty big downside risks, especially having to do with the interrelated issues of possible overvaluations in housing markets and low term premiums in bond markets.  These risks are highlighted by the alternative simulations in the Greenbook concerning a rise in the saving rate and a higher term premium.  In summary, I see the Greenbook’s view of real activity for this year as very reasonable, but downside risks to that forecast give me pause. Turning to inflation, core PCE inflation over the past twelve months—at 1.9 percent—has come in higher than I would like to see.  But assuming that growth slows to trend later this year, my outlook for inflation in 2006 is more optimistic than the Greenbook.  One reason stems from work our staff has done on the extent of pass-through from energy prices to both labor compensation and core price inflation.  As I’ve said before, the evidence suggests to us that there has been relatively little pass-through since the early 1980s, perhaps due to the credibility of our commitment to the stability of core inflation.  Under our assumption of very little pass-through, we expect the core PCE price index to rise around 1¾ percent, both this year and next.  The Greenbook shows an increase of 2¼ percent this year, presumably reflecting larger energy-price pass-through, and then a drop to about 1¾ percent in 2007 as the effects of energy prices subside.  So though I differ with the Greenbook on inflation in 2006, over the longer period I think we’re about on the same page. economy is near full employment with real GDP tending toward trend-like growth.  Core inflation is within a reasonable range but a bit on the high side.  Needless to say, it’s fitting for Chairman Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape.  And if I might torture a simile, I would say, Mr. Chairman, that the situation you’re handing off to your successor is a lot like a tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot.  [Laughter] Positive though the situation is, it also obviously raises the issue of how much higher the funds rate needs to go to keep the economy on this desirable trajectory.  There are a number of ways of looking at this question, all yielding similar answers.  First, a funds rate of 4½ percent rests right near the center of the range of estimates for the equilibrium funds rate.  Along the same lines, our staff ran simulations of FRB/US to calculate the net effect of monetary policy actions over the past several years on real GDP growth.  The results are that, after adding importantly to growth over the last few years, past policy accommodation is roughly neutral in terms of growth this year and next.  A second approach is to compare a funds rate of 4½ percent with the recommendations of Taylor-type rules.  Such calculations suggest that a 4½ percent funds rate this quarter is a bit on the tight side now but should be about right later this year under the Greenbook forecast.  The long-run simulations in the Bluebook are a third method to judge the stance of policy.  These simulations show the funds rate optimally peaking at a little over 5 percent, well above where we are now.  But a major factor accounting for this relatively high peak is the Greenbook’s assumption, incorporated in the Bluebook simulation, that energy pass-through pushes up core PCE inflation to 2¼ percent this year.  And as I’ve emphasized, we’re not convinced that this much pass-through is likely, and our lower inflation forecast implies a lower peak for the funds rate along an optimal path. meeting, as I think we should, we will be close to the appropriate peak in the funds rate based on what we know now.  As for the future path of the funds rate, I believe it should be highly dependent on unfolding events and cannot be prejudged with any degree of confidence.  So the bottom line is that we need to position ourselves for flexibility in our policy choices going forward. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Consistent with the national economy, overall activity in the Third District slowed somewhat more than expected in the fourth quarter.  Despite this slowing, the general view in my District is that our regional economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace in 2006.   Payroll employment continues to expand in our three states, but at a more moderate pace than we saw in the first half of 2005.  Overall, market conditions remain firm.  The three-state unemployment rate ended up at 4.8 percent, slightly lower than the national rate.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey declined to plus 3.3 in January, its lowest level in seven months.  But the indexes of shipments, new orders, and employment were all up.  This divergence is unusual.  Typically, they move together.  When they do diverge, I tend to put more weight on the shipments and new orders indexes, as these reflect the respondents’ own firms rather than the opinions about general economic conditions.  In addition, the fact that our firms have not yet changed their capital spending plans for 2006 suggests that their outlook remains positive. Retail sales in our District are rising moderately.  Retailers still express concern about the potential depressing effect of higher gasoline and heating costs on consumer purchases in 2006.  Our auto dealers have not fared as well.  In fact, our District has seen a decline in automobile sales.  nonresidential construction continues to improve.  In fact, the office market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and office vacancy is declining in both the city and the suburbs.  By contrast, over the past month or so, we have continued to receive anecdotal reports that a slowdown in residential construction may be at hand.  Real estate contacts report that house-price appreciation has slowed or even ceased, and there has been an increase in inventories.  These signs, however, seem to point to a softening of activity, not to a sharp drop. We have received some welcome indication of a moderation in price pressures in the District.  Our survey measures of prices received and prices paid were down in January and well below their October peaks.  Expected price increases also declined sharply.  The only caveat I would put on that statement is that the survey was taken before the most recent run-up in energy prices. Turning to the nation, the advance fourth-quarter GDP report was quite a bit weaker than we were all expecting.  That said, we, too, think it’s too soon to conclude that the weakness seen in the fourth quarter is more than a temporary soft patch.  Our forecast for GDP over the next two years is similar to that of the original Greenbook that we received this month.  We expect growth to be on average around 3½ percent, near potential.  We have a somewhat smoother path than the Greenbook since we expect the boost in activity from the rebuilding effort in the hurricane-afflicted areas to be more spread out than front-loaded. We also see somewhat stronger employment growth next year than the Greenbook because we see somewhat stronger output growth in 2007.  We project nonfarm payrolls to rise at an average of 160,000 a month this year, stronger in the first half as people displaced by hurricanes continue to return to work.  We project an average increase in payrolls of about 150,000 per month next year.  However, our unemployment rate forecasts are similar, about 5 percent, because we see somewhat higher labor force participation. We anticipate core PCE to rise a bit less than 2 percent in 2006 and then to accelerate to 2 percent in 2007, reflecting a modest acceleration in unit labor costs.  In contrast, the Greenbook sees a slight deceleration in core inflation over the forecast period. Our forecast is predicated on being near the end of the tightening cycle.  Exactly where we stop is yet to be determined; the data will tell the Committee.  But all of these data suggest that we are closing in and we are close to being done.  For this meeting, I think it’s prudent for us to do what the market expects and make another move of 25 basis points.  But I think we also want to be in a position to pause if that is appropriate, given the incoming economic data. Of course, I will not be here for that interesting discussion.  [Laughter]  As you know, this is the last FOMC meeting that I will be attending as President of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.  I am honored to have had the opportunity to lead that institution.  Of all the experiences during my six years of service at the Fed, none was more challenging and more rewarding than serving on this Committee.  I have enjoyed and learned from the first-rate staff of the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  I feel privileged to have served at a remarkable point in economic history.  In my tenure, we’ve gone through a recession and a recovery, seen concerns shift from disinflation to inflation, moved to a record low funds rate, and then returned it to more-normal levels.  And all of this was accompanied by an unprecedented degree of transparency in our policy discussions.  I have also been inspired by the leadership shown by our Chairman, I may add, in forging a consensus from diverse opinions in periods of uncertainty and in fostering a collegial service at the Fed a rewarding experience.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I should point out that a luncheon in the President’s honor is planned at the March meeting.  And I guess you and I will be looking from the sidelines, but neither one of us will know what happened at that March meeting until we get to it.  [Laughter]  Thank you for your nice remarks.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There’s not a lot new in New England.  So I thought I’d just skip over my usual probably more-lengthy-than-necessary comments on the region.  Let me just mention a couple of things, though.  Employment growth is still slower, and income growth is still slower than that of the nation.  Our regional unemployment rate went up rather than down over the past year, and we have seen some slowing in residential real estate markets.  However, surprisingly enough, there seems to be a good deal of optimism in discussions we have had with people about business spending and about commercial real estate markets.  So, for the first time in five or six years, we’ve actually had net absorption of space, both downtown and in the suburbs.  That situation is making a big difference in the smiles on people’s faces around town.  I hope it means that New England is getting back and moving along the same trajectory as the nation. Turning to the nation, we, like most observers, were surprised at the modest growth rate of the economy in the fourth quarter.  But we, like almost everybody else, believe that the reduced pace of government spending and smaller-than-expected inventory investment that affected the fourth quarter are likely to be temporary and reflect issues of timing rather than overall economic strength.  Thus, we, too, anticipate a slightly stronger first quarter this year than we had before.  But our forecast takes the same basic trajectory over the balance of ’06 and ’07—that is, strength in the However, as we look at GDP, our forecast for ’07 is slower—½ percent or a little bit less—than the forecast for ’06, reflecting an expected outright decline in housing investment.  We also see inflation trending off both this year and next, with core PCE inflation never above 2 percent over the two-year period.  I mean, not “never,” which is a strong word, but at the points we’re mapping.  Some of this difference in price pressures is accounted for by a sense of a somewhat greater supply of labor resources, as reflected in a slightly lower NAIRU and a higher labor force participation rate. Looking at these forecasts and assessing all the data and anecdotal inputs I have received since the last meeting, I am struck by a couple of things.  First, these forecasts, and the vast majority of those available from other sources, describe an almost ideal outcome.  U.S. demand is strong but slowing, as consumers save more and borrow less.  Fiscal stimulus diminishes, business spending remains solid, employment grows, inflation edges off, and foreign growth is spurred by domestic demand at last and acts to create some export growth, though we continue to have a widening current account deficit.  If these forecasts were to be realized, it would truly be just about the best of outcomes, and I would agree with President Yellen—a major sweet spot as the Chairman hands over the reins. But that scenario sort of begs the question of risks, both large and small, and how they are balanced.  We could certainly be surprised by new energy shocks or geopolitical events of such magnitude to cause financial turmoil and consumer and business retrenchment.  We could also witness the turbulence that could accompany a sharp unwinding of the nation’s ever-growing external deficit.  But you don’t have to focus on major upsets.  Risks of a lesser proportion loom as well.  We could very well be wrong about the remaining capacity in labor markets, and the resulting given the solid pace of external growth and pressures on a range of commodity prices.  To date, however, the growth of wages and salaries has been on the slow side, particularly relative to productivity, and there is little evidence that firms believe they have the pricing power to pass on much more than energy surcharges.  Indeed, their profit margins suggest that they have a cushion against increases in input costs.  Alternatively, the impact of a cooling housing market could take a larger bite out of consumption than we now expect and cause a greater-than-projected, though welcome, increase in personal saving.  This would, of course, slow the economy from baseline and damp price pressures.  We haven’t seen this yet either, but it could be just as likely as missing on the inflation side. Thus, as I look at both the upside and downside risks, they seem to me to be more balanced than they have been.  As some evidence of this, both the Greenbook and the fed funds futures ’06 or early ’07. I also find myself beginning to wonder about the cost of being wrong.  When policy was arguably much more accommodative, it seemed to me that letting inflation get out of hand might be harder to deal with and ultimately more damaging to the economy than if growth slipped a bit.  That expectations so, too, is some sense that policy will be supportive of growth when the threat of rising inflation is less imminent.  In short, we need to be credible about achieving both our goals.  At this point, another nudge toward a policy rate that neither stimulates nor restrains the economy seems appropriate.  But the need for further moves seems to me to be increasingly driven by the incoming data. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I took note of the two Davids’ forecast of 4.7 percent growth in the first quarter.  Especially against President Yellen’s comments, it brought to mind the name of one of Henry Jerome’s albums on the Decca label called “Brazen Brass.”  That is, some might consider brazen or even brassy that it jibes or, in this context, jives with what I’m hearing anecdotally both in our District and nationwide—though we have only three and a half weeks of observations and the year-end to look at. Very quickly to sum up these observations, the CFO of UPS put it this way: “The economy feels much better than what I read.”  UPS reports a very strong December adjusted for seasonality, and January has stayed strong.  Over the year-end in the recent past, they have had only one holiday peak day of processing 20 million shipments.  They had three at year-end of more than 21 million.  Burlington Northern–Santa Fe’s volume for the first three weeks of ’06 is up 9 percent year over year.  Interestingly, they just auctioned off their entire lumber-carrying capacity for the year at an 8 percent premium over current market.  Texas Instruments reports a positive book-to-bill ratio, which is a very rare thing coming out of the fourth quarter.  They find that they underinvested relative to demand and report a seven- to ten-day delivery delinquency rate.  As the CFO says, “We have stopped scratching our heads about demand, and we’re just taking it all in.” The CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.A. reports that “the consumer hasn’t hidden” as expected.  It’s true that traffic is down, but average purchases are up in the Southeast and Texas, and the West is strongest in overall demand, aided by the warmest winter by their calculations in 112 years.  The CEO and the top managers met with their 5,000 suppliers the week before last in Kansas City, and he reported that the suppliers described themselves as “upbeat.”  Wal-Mart and others report what we’re hearing from the railroads, the shippers, and other retailers—all of which lends verisimilitude through Atlanta to the State of Florida and then, of course, the “uber” states across Texas and up to California and the West Coast—is enjoying robust growth.  To the extent that there’s weakness, it appears to be in the north central and northeastern regions. On the price front, Dick Evans, on our board, of Cullen/Frost, a very astute banker, says that he “keeps hearing people talk about potential inflation, but the economy seems to be able to pull it out of the hat.”  Wal-Mart International reports no pricing power other than in resin-based products.  The CEO marvels at how the world continues to, as he puts it, “replace technology at lower and lower prices.”  Further up the retail chain, Penney’s CEO reports no price inflation in home furnishings and continued price deflation in apparel.  And on the two subjects for which I reported price pressures before, the CEO of DX Services, a large chemical company, reports that PVC prices have fallen off because of overproduction but the prices of the key building blocks of chlorine and ethylene are falling.  “There’s no pricing on the upside,” according to that CEO.  And as for my other favorite subject of diapers, incidentally, Proctor & Gamble and Kimberly Clark have rolled back their price increases of 5 percent. Our shipping contact at Northern Navigation reports that Panamax rates—and Panamax is the key fleet of bulk carriers—are now down to $16,700 per day from $17,300 in December, which was down 35 percent from the average for the year of ’05.  The container fleet will absorb a 14 percent increase in fleet size per year for the next three to four years driven largely by what one could consider Chinese ego because they have now entered the building market in size.  And interestingly, UPS worries that, if this continues, they will come under price pressure to decrease air freight rates.  Despite fierce demand and delivery delinquencies, Texas Instruments reports that it has slowed down its price increases. feel comfortable with it.  I started with Henry Jerome.  Let me conclude with another Henry, the Fifth, at least as written by Shakespeare.  I’ve been honored to serve with you, Mr. Chairman, the least time of anybody at this table.  In Alfalfan terms, I’m just a sprout in the crop of otherwise experienced men and women.  But I’m sure they would agree with me, without getting too dramatic, about the appropriateness of Henry V’s remarks at Agincourt—and I’ll rephrase them—economists and bankers now asleep (remember these are bankers) shall think themselves accursed that they were not here.  I consider myself privileged to have been here, Mr. Chairman.  This isn’t Agincourt, but it’s important.  I’ve served under two saxophone players now, [laughter] and I would say without question, you’re a leader of the very best kind, and I thank you for your leadership. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  And the last time I spoke to Henry V [laughter] I got a view of his notions of strategy.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic activity continued to advance broadly in December and January.  Service-sector employment and revenue strengthened, and retailers reported generally strong sales and a pickup in hiring.  In manufacturing, the signals are mixed.  Shipments flattened out in December and turned down in January, and our new orders index turned negative as well.  At the same time, we’ve seen a very sharp rise in our index of expected manufacturing shipments six months out.  Major swings in this index do a pretty good job of predicting subsequent upturns in orders and shipments.  The last time we saw a rise nearly this steep was at the beginning of 2002, and a sharp rebound in orders and shipments soon followed.  While the figures for prices paid and prices received for both manufacturing and services have come down off their November highs, they remain noticeably elevated, and measures of expected price trends have moved up over the past two months. economic growth was on pretty solid footing.  Friday’s report came in weaker than expected, of course, but as Dave Stockton mentioned, it appears plausible that several temporary factors are at work.  So I continue to think that prospects for economic growth are pretty good this year.  Both employment and consumer spending are likely to continue expanding at a healthy pace, and the fundamentals for business investment point toward fairly robust spending growth. At our last meeting, I, like many others, believed that the threat that energy-price increases would pass through to core inflation and inflation expectations had diminished since the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  However, I wasn’t convinced that the threat was entirely behind us, and unfortunately, my concerns on that score remain.  Oil prices have nearly returned to their Greenbook’s estimate, and the Greenbook has reversed course and marked up the ’06 inflation forecast a bit.  The staff is now expecting core PCE inflation to rise to 2.3 percent in the middle of 2006 and not to fall below 2 percent until 2007 and then only slightly below.  This forecast represents a bulge that is somewhat more extended than I would like to see.  So, for today, I believe we should strive not to move the near-term yield curve down. In the broader context of the historic nature of today’s meeting, however, it’s quite striking that among the prominent subjects are a quarter-point bulge in inflation and the issue of whether long-run and trend inflation should be 1.5 percent or 2.0 percent.  Few now doubt whether the Federal Reserve can or will keep inflation stable, a question that was seriously in play decades ago.  Your leadership in the intervening years, Mr. Chairman, completed the work begun by your predecessor to restore the expectation of price stability that had been lost in the transition from the prior commodity standard.  Given the number of centuries that regime was in place, I believe future transition.  This achievement required altering public expectations about the trend rate of inflation that we would tolerate.  It also required substantially damping the association between strong real growth and resurgent inflation.  Moreover, it required demonstrating that there was no need for adverse cost shocks to spawn higher trend inflation.  The key to all of this, in my mind, was establishing a pattern of predictable FOMC behavior that was well understood by the public.  Leading this transition as you did, Mr. Chairman, required tremendous acumen and tremendous courage.  Personally, Mr. Chairman, I count serving with you, however briefly, as one of the greatest privileges an economist could imagine. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  By now I’m sure that most of you are tired of hearing me report that conditions in my District are not as vigorous as conditions in most of the country.  I know that I’m tired of repeating it.  Fortunately, optimism is increasing in many parts of my District.  My directors and business contacts that have national and international business interests report fairly solid conditions in most of their industries.  They tell me that they plan to maintain a strong pace of capital spending this year and that they expect healthy productivity gains from doing so.  These trends encourage me to think that our economy will be able to maintain the 3 percent rate of structural productivity growth that underlies the Greenbook baseline projection.  Since we are nearing the point of monetary policy neutrality, I’m counting on a strong rate of productivity growth to help us gradually nudge the inflation rate back down over the next several years.  I have not changed my thinking about the underlying trends in the economy since our last meeting.  I was pretty much in sync with the Greenbook outlook then and remain so today.  The quarters but not to affect the longer-term outlook. Even though I still expect to see headline and core inflation moderate over the projection period, I have become a bit more sensitive to the upside inflation risks in the baseline projection.  First, in the Greenbook we received last week, the staff concluded that inflation this year could creep up a bit more than they had thought in December, and the staff elevated their estimate of core PCE inflation for the fourth quarter from 1.9 percent to 2.2 percent as a result of the most recent BEA report.  The staff hedged against that possibility by imposing a temporary 25 basis point surtax on their December fed funds rate path beginning at our next meeting, and it seems sensible to me to keep this option open.  At our December meeting I said that I thought we were very close to being able to stop increasing our fed funds rate target at every meeting.  I still think so.  If monetary policy is a combination of science and art, I think we’re now out of the laboratory and inside the art studio, and having flexibility as we go forward is highly desirable to me. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I have to admit that I’ve spent more time since our last meeting thinking about what to say in acknowledgement of your last meeting than I’ve thought about economic conditions, and it’s impossible to come up with words to express my feelings.  I just simply want to say that it has been truly an honor and a privilege to serve under your leadership of this Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also have not had the occasion in the public farewell ceremonies to say thank you to you.  So let me say what an honor it has been to serve under your leadership and to be associated with the great confidence and respect you’ve given people in what we do at the Fed.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. District that may have implications for the national outlook.  Generally I would say that the anecdotal information and the available data suggest that economic growth in our southeast region continues at a very solid pace.  At the past two meetings, I reported evidence of the slowing in the real estate markets, and those reports continue.  It has become especially notable in a few selected pulling back on their construction lending.  We’re receiving increasing numbers of reports that planned projects have either been put on hold or are not going to come out of the ground.  And we’re now beginning to see some signs of downward pressure on prices—in some cases in the high single digits, but in a few markets substantially higher than that.  As an example, we heard one report that in the Panama City area of Florida, condos that had been going for $600 a square foot are now being priced at $450 a square foot.  That’s a 25 percent correction.  I think we have to view these corrections that are taking place as healthy.  Worker shortages due to hurricane cleanup work in Louisiana and coastal Mississippi are also contributing to the slowdown in Florida.  I would emphasize, again, that this evidence is not indicative of a broad trend throughout the District.  Our general real estate situation still feels pretty solid. I’d also like to make a couple of comments on the situation of the hurricane areas, where, according to the staff , FEMA spending turned out to be less than expected in the fourth quarter.  At the last meeting I noted it had become clear that the stimulus from the flow of government funds would be slower than expected.  Work in both Mississippi and Louisiana is still mostly in the initial cleanup phase.  Despite what we see in public statements, there is no substantial rebuilding under way yet, except for casino reconstruction in Mississippi.  The grace period on mortgage payments has already or is about to run out, and this could bring additional hardship for the affected property actually be at risk.   Considerable uncertainty exists concerning federal flood insurance policies going forward, and in certain areas no rebuilding can take place until flood maps are redrawn, building codes are reassessed, soil contamination is assessed, and permits are issued—all of which could take many, many months.  Because so few people have been able to move back to their properties, even those homes that were only modestly damaged by the storm are now beginning to show signs of deterioration due to mold and a lack of maintenance and repairs.  I think the take-away from this discussion is that the economic kick we’ve been expecting from hurricane rebuilding is probably going to be spread over 2006, 2007, and perhaps even a bit further.   The damage to the energy sector in the Gulf now appears to have been worse than most had thought.  Although national production of crude is reported back at about 92 percent of pre-hurricane levels and natural gas production is back to 95 percent of pre-hurricane levels, our sources tell us that 25 percent of the Gulf region capacity for crude and about 16 percent of the Gulf capacity for natural gas remain shut in.  And that shortfall, in my view, remains significant.  More than half the crude oil that is shut in is attributable to the production lost from Shell’s Mars platform, which isn’t expected to be operational until mid-2006.  Our contacts are also now saying that natural gas production will probably not fully return to pre-hurricane levels because the production at several sites is already in decline—as much as 8 percent below the peak. Finally, as has been the case for some time, we’ve continued to receive information from our directors of pricing pressures, of plans to push through price increases, and of a greater willingness on the part of upstream purchasers to accept those increases.  And I think we are likely seeing some of that in the latest inflation data. disappointed by the considerably weaker than expected initial report on fourth-quarter GDP, but like the Greenbook, I think I’m satisfied that we can explain most of the shortfall.  I do not see it as an erosion of fundamentals, and in fact, I think we may well see some offsetting gains in the current quarter.  I expect a return to solid growth in the current quarter.  My own forecast for output, inflation, and unemployment for 2006 and 2007 remains positive. At the same time, there are some especially interesting unknowns and risks at the moment that we’ll have to watch being played out.  As others have already suggested, energy remains a major wild card with the very delicate balance between worldwide supply and worldwide demand.  With recovery of the energy industry in our Gulf Coast region not yet complete, with the fragile political situation in many oil-producing regions around the world, and with the ever-present risk of natural disaster and sabotage, it seems reasonable to expect continued elevated energy prices and substantial energy-price volatility.  It’s not clear to me whether households and businesses have fully adjusted to these new realities.  The residential real estate adjustment, which seems to be beginning to take place both in the level of activity and in prices, could have important implications, as Dave Stockton and others have already suggested.  Whether consumers will be able and willing to continue to smooth their expenditures relative to current income seems to be substantially dependent upon home prices, mortgage interest rates, and the ability to tap home equity.  And the potential inflation pressures we’ve highlighted for some while, and which still do not seem to have played out fully, should not be too easily and too quickly discounted. All things considered, I think we have to be reasonably comfortable with the outlook and the policy path we have been on, but I look forward to discussions of policy and the way we communicate what we see ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, in thinking about the status of the U.S. economy and the appropriate funds rate target at this meeting, I would start by suggesting that, in my judgment at least, the current funds rate is probably within the neutral range.  Therefore, we should be mindful of not going too far, especially when it would appear that growth is slowing to trend.  The most compelling reason for considering the move now is the continued drift upward in core inflation, but even in this case, I think we need to be especially aware of the past increases in the funds rate.  We have yet to see their full effects on inflation. The fourth-quarter growth was surprising; but at this point, as others have said, it does not yet alter our long-term outlook.  Like the staff, however, I revised upward my 2006 forecast ¼ percentage point and now expect that growth will be about 3¾ percent in 2006, about ½ percentage point above trend, and will return to trend in 2007.  Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be about 2½ percent this year, as higher energy prices are passed through to higher overall and core inflation.  However, it is reasonable to expect that the increase will be temporary, as others have said, with core inflation likely to fall back to 2¼ percent in 2007.  The reasons for this pattern have a familiar ring.  Greater-than-trend growth reflects the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation and generally supportive financial conditions, whereas the prospective slowing growth reflects the removal of monetary accommodation and, in this instance, higher energy prices. Evidence from our District is consistent with an outlook of strong but slowing growth as well.  Manufacturing production and new orders rose solidly.  Expectations for future production remained high, and expectations for future orders actually surged.  Hiring plans also rose strongly in consumer spending was solid, though not spectacular, during the holiday season.  In fact, a number of our contacts said their holiday sales were below plan.  Just quickly in the farm sector, there are concerns being voiced for 2006 following a generally good year in 2005, and they were mostly that drought may be reemerging in the District. Wage pressures in the District remain mostly subdued, and increases in raw material costs actually slowed somewhat.  However, manufacturers continued to raise output prices in response to past increases in input costs, and a substantial number said they were raising wages more than normal for certain types of workers in short supply.  Reports of retail prices said that increases were down somewhat from the last meeting but still higher than they were just last summer. Let me turn just briefly to the risks.  I would submit that inflation risks are on the upside and output risks have become more on the downside recently, not exactly the kinds of risk that are friendly from a policy perspective.  The outlook for core inflation is 2¼ to 2½ percent.  This is higher than I would prefer.  Moreover, the potential for even higher energy prices makes core inflation more likely to be higher rather than lower over the next several months.  But at the same time, the risks to output are on the downside.  First, forward momentum has certainly diminished.  For example, real GDP grew about 2.6 percent during the last half of 2005, decidedly below trend.  In addition, while the fourth-quarter slowdown was probably temporary, it could also be signaling a more fundamental slowdown.  Finally, a possible increase in the term premium poses downside risks to growth.  You know the term premium is far below the historical average.  If the decline reverses faster than expected, both would be significantly weaker as shown by the Greenbook alternative scenario.  As I see things then falling out, the choices are obviously difficult, but I think that the inflation risk for the time-being is the greater risk, and therefore I would be inclined to move likely in the fed funds rate at the next meeting. And finally, Mr. Chairman, although I have not served as long with you as some others around this table, I have served among the longest with you, and I would like you to know it has been a real privilege. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s break for coffee.  Since our time is really quite restricted, I would request that we come back in seven minutes.  [Laughter] [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  David Stockton. MR. STOCKTON.  Mr. Chairman, I quickly consulted with my labor economist experts at the coffee break about your question about the demographic effects on the workweek, and, indeed, there is—and it’s incorporated in our forecast—a modest effect of the aging of the workforce on the workweek, with older workers having shorter workweeks.  Obviously, the longer-term trend has been driven more by the shift in the composition of employment from manufacturing toward more service-oriented industries, which have shorter workweeks, but there is a perceptible demographic effect as well. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What strikes me from my conversations with my contacts is the growing confidence that they do not see major risks on either side, that there are reduced standard errors around their projections.  Very few had comments or concerns about inflation outside of energy, which, of course, is on everybody’s mind. I’d like to make an analytical point that actually comes from my UPS contact.  I think I mentioned at an earlier meeting that UPS is moving its business off the mixed rail—the piggyback.  which in turn is a consequence of the railroads’ decision that it is not worth the capital investment that would be necessary for what for railroads is a relatively low-yielding business.  UPS is also working to maximize the return on its own capital.  The company is very disciplined about adding capital and is planning to price low-yielding business out of its network.  That is, for the low-yield products, they’re going to raise prices expecting that the business will go away.  My contact at UPS said that he thought that the strategy would not really be successful and that they will probably be looking at substantial increases in capital spending in ’07, once they find that they have optimized their existing plant, that the volume doesn’t go away when they try to raise the prices on it, or that not enough of it goes away.  And I think that this phenomenon might be more general in our economy.  Companies are very disciplined about their capital investment.  But as the economy continues to expand, they’re going to run out of ways to optimize the existing capital plant, and we will see investment coming in stronger over the next couple of years.  That’s an observation that I support the Greenbook’s forecast, plus or minus a quarter of a standard deviation.  [Laughter]  Not worth worrying about.  Instead, what I’ve been trying to do is to make lists—and these could be much longer—of risks on the high side and the low side.  On the high side, I would point to commodity prices, which are high and have gone up a lot, and growing strength—as I just commented—in business fixed investment.  I mention high money growth, because I don’t think that the rapid money growth is fully explained, and it certainly has frequently been a precursor of higher inflation. Some indicators on the other side—we talked about housing, the possible reversal of the unusually low saving rate, the behavior of the yield curve, the risk of oil supply disturbances.  Most primarily—Africa as well—could certainly produce a significant downward shock on economic activity and upward shock on prices.  No doubt these lists could be amplified, and I think it’s probably worth spending more time thinking through the risks and how to respond to various events than it is trying to optimize the forecast and get that last quarter of standard deviation exactly right. Mr. Chairman, many around the table have commented about their experience serving here.  I will, of course, echo those.  I would like to put a little different angle on it.  Of the people who have had a major impact in my life, you are certainly one.  I mark on the fingers of one hand the people who have had extraordinary influence on me.  You have influenced me mostly in my professional life but also in many aspects of leadership that go beyond economics and policy in a narrower sense.  So I thank you for that.  I am also looking forward to continuing to learn from you.  I understand that you have some books, at least in your head.  And given my interest in making sure we have clear communication, I have a suggestion for a title for your first book.  And it is in line with some books by your predecessors.  So I suggest “The Joy of Central Banking.”  [Laughter]  And I suggest that your second book be “More Joy of Central Banking.”  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  “How to Be a Joyous Central Banker, Even Though We Don’t Have Hearts.”  [Laughter]  Can we end the speculation on the title?  [Laughter]  Thanks very much, Bill.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with one anecdote about housing activity in the District.  I don’t know how representative this is nationwide, obviously, but there are signs of slowing in both housing construction and, more dramatically, in sales recently.  And this winter in the Twin Cities, several hundred unionized construction workers are not working.  Last year 100 percent were.  But they’re all expected to be back at work in the spring, and that suggests occur later and be more severe than I was earlier expecting. As far as the national economy is concerned, like others, I am inclined to discount the fourth quarter.  I find the Greenbook story about the outlook reasonably convincing.  I personally think that we will see pretty good growth in both ’06 and ’07.  I tend to rely, as you know, on the underlying fundamentals and the resilience of the economy, and those things seem to me to be sound and in place.  And so I think the overall outlook is pretty good. I do think that there was a disconnect in the fourth quarter between the supply or output side and the demand side.  If you look at the numbers for employment and hours, you would have certainly come up with a stronger forecast.  Now, you may plug in a negative productivity number.  That’s one way of reconciling it.  Maybe the November and December employment data will get revised down.  I guess that’s another way of reconciling it.  Perhaps some of the aggregate demand components will ultimately be revised up a bit.  But there does seem to be a disconnect there, nothing that I find all that troubling, but something I think worth bearing in mind if we want to think about the fourth quarter. I think the key to the outlook and to policy going forward, though, is inflation.  And I went and looked at what has happened to the core PCE over the past eight or nine years.  And the range of increases in core PCE inflation over that period was about 1¼ to 2¼ percent, and I think the average over the past eight or nine years was something like 1¾ percent.  I don’t cite those numbers just to prove that I can look them up.  I cite them because I would characterize that whole period as a period of low inflation, maybe something resembling price stability.  And if I ask myself, “Is inflation likely to break out on the high side of that range in the relatively near term?” my answer to would also answer that question with a “no.” Part of that is, of course, that we have been moving policy, and it seems to me that policy, measured by the real federal funds rate, is now certainly in the ballpark where it needs to be.  I anticipate that we’ll move again today, as I think we should, in part to validate market expectations.  Is policy perfectly positioned within the ballpark?  Well, I don’t know the answer to that, but I do think it is well positioned within the ballpark, and I think we need to bear that in mind as we go forward. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, in the interest of crispness, I’ve removed a substantial tribute from my remarks.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am most appreciative.  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I’d like the record to show that I think you’re pretty terrific, too.  [Laughter]  And thinking in terms of probabilities, I think the risk that we decide in the future that you’re even better than we think is higher than the alternative.  [Laughter] With that, the economy looks pretty good to us, perhaps a bit better than it did at the last meeting.  With the near-term monetary policy path that’s now priced into the markets, we think the economy is likely to grow slightly above trend in ’06 and close to trend in ’07.  We expect underlying inflation to follow a path close to current levels before slowing to a rate closer to 1.5 percent for the core PCE sometime out there.  Relative to the Greenbook, we’re a little softer on growth in ’06 and a little stronger in ’07, but our inflation outlook is similar. The uncertainty around this forecast still seems considerable, perhaps more than the market has priced in.  On the positive side, consumer and business confidence still seems pretty high, with income growth is likely to be pretty strong.  Investment may be strengthening, and it could surprise us with more strength.  The tone of the anecdotal to us seems more positive, less cautious than it has been.  And just to cite our Empire survey, the six-month-ahead numbers show a fair amount of optimism.  Overall, financial conditions, of course, still seem quite supportive of continued expansion.  Global growth has strengthened.  And like the staff, the market seems to have looked through the negative surprises in the fourth-quarter numbers and priced in a bit more, rather than less, confidence about the strength of demand growth going forward. On the darker side, we have the familiar concerns about potential adverse shocks, energy supply disruptions, terrorism, et cetera.  But even in the absence of these events, we face a fair amount of uncertainty about key elements of the forecast.  The prevailing expectation of a gradual moderation in housing prices and a relatively small increase in the saving rate could prove too optimistic.  Private investment growth could slow further, productivity growth could disappoint, risk premiums could rise sharply.  And, of course, that could happen even in the absence of a major deterioration in the growth or inflation outlook.  But this, on balance, still leaves us with what looks like a relatively balanced set of risks around what is still a quite favorable growth forecast. The inflation outlook still merits some concern—I think modest concern—about upside risk.  Underlying inflation is still somewhat higher than we would be comfortable with over time.  The core indexes are running above levels said to define our preference over time.  Other measures of underlying inflation are running above the core rates.  The behavior of inflation expectations at longer horizons has been reassuringly stable in the face of the elevated headline numbers, but the levels are still at the higher end of comfort.  With the economy near potential, unit labor cost growth should accelerate.  And, of course, although profit margins still show ample room to absorb more demand, the continued rise in commodity prices, other input costs, and the latest increase in energy prices all suggest a possibility of further upward pressure. With this outlook and this set of risks, we believe some further tightening of monetary policy is necessary with another small move today and a signal that some further tightening is probable.  We’re comfortable with how the market’s expectations have evolved over the past few weeks and with the present forecast of perhaps one—maybe slightly more than one—move beyond today.  It’s hard, though, to understand why the market attaches so little uncertainty to monetary policy in the second half of the year.  And this underscores the fact that one of our communication challenges ahead is to make sure we convey enough uncertainty about our view of the outlook and its implications for monetary policy.  In this regard, I want to compliment the recent innovations to the Bluebook presentations and hope that they persist. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The surprise of the fourth-quarter GDP number and the slightly elevated inflationary pressure have caused us to take, I think, a closer look at the underlying strength of the economy.  And to an extent it is reassuring—certainly, the strength in industrial production and real personal consumption.  However, the risks that we have seen before remain and may, in fact, be slightly elevated.  The potential risk of increased oil costs and the pass-through effect into underlying core inflation is at least slightly heightened, and with the flattening of housing values, the potential effect on consumption remains slightly strong. It is often easy for us at these meetings to say we’ll have a clearer understanding at the next meeting of where we are; but although the next meeting answers this meeting’s questions, it also raises new questions.  However, in this instance, we may have more reason than not to make that predictive power, we may see a strong report.  I couldn’t help but notice the juxtaposition of the initial claims chart next to the GDP number as an indication that it’s one that will be looked at carefully.  Also, given the magnitude of the change in the prior-period GDP, the revised GDP number for the fourth quarter may be much different from the preliminary number.  Also, between now and the next meeting, our new Chairman will be making a semiannual presentation to the Congress on the state of the economy, with an opportunity to be more definitive than we can perhaps be at this meeting. In conclusion, I suggest that we make the obvious move and raise our target ¼ point but not be any more definitive or predictive than necessary in the accompanying statement.  I support President Yellen’s suggestion for flexibility in our description today.  And I share with everybody else the honor of having worked with you for these four years that I’ve been here. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much, Governor.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Greenbook baseline presents a relatively positive scenario.  But as the 90 percent confidence interval given in the Greenbook clearly indicates, there is considerable uncertainty around this baseline.  In a theoretical world of certainty equivalence, that range of uncertainty would not matter.  But as you’ve taught us many times, in the world of practical policymaking, how that uncertainty is resolved will matter importantly for policy judgments. As a mere cadet, if you will, sitting next to the monetary policy Yoda, [laughter] I will attempt to look at some of these uncertainties and to understand how they may unfold in their implications for policy.  Yoda, of course, is a complimentary word in my household.  [Laughter]  One particularly salient aspect of uncertainty relates to the way that inflation expectations are term inflation expectations remained stable or edged even somewhat lower, reversing the run-up that we saw in the fall.  As the presentation this morning showed, preliminary January Michigan survey results for median inflation expectations for the coming year ticked down, and median five- and ten-year inflation expectations also moved lower.  Rate spreads from TIPS also indicated remarkably contained inflation expectations despite oil price shocks. This stability is both remarkable and quite important, because, in my view at least, the optimal course of monetary policy at this juncture depends critically on the fragility or stability of inflation expectations in the presence of the oil price shock.  I judge that, for now at least, this important element of uncertainty supports a continued execution of the strategy we are following to date, with no need to fear that we’re falling behind the curve, even as energy prices have spiked again.  Of course, with the slight rise in the near-term inflation outlook and, in fact, slight deterioration in near-term inflation itself, prudence will require close monitoring of these variables as we go forward.  But thus far, I judge that the announced strategy is consistent with maintaining our credibility. Second, as we discussed earlier, there is great uncertainty about why long-term rates are low and what the shape and level of the yield curve may imply for us.  As we saw in yesterday’s Board briefing, forward nominal rates fairly far out in time have moved down over the past year, both here and abroad, and are low today by historical standards.  As we know, long-term rates are low today partly because inflation expectations are low.  If this were the whole story, short-term rates would not need to depart from the historical terms or norms in real terms.  But while this is part of the story, it isn’t the whole story.  As we’ve already discussed, if the shape of the yield curve and low proper response would be to run a looser-than-average monetary policy. But I agree, and I think most of us agree, with the staff assessment that the low real long-term interest rate and a flat yield curve are not precursors to a global softening and an expected drop in rates but rather are due to an unusually low term premium.  In my judgment, part of the reason for that low term premium is an increased assessment on the part of global investors that the future looks like an environment involving less risk than usual.  This was borne out I think in Dino’s pie charts earlier on and also in the global equity markets.  I’d also say, based on various conversations I’ve had with central bankers in January on the various committees that I attend and others I attend with the Chairman, there is a general sense in the world of policy that this low-risk assessment is approximately right.  However, I continue to think that these lower rates reflect some forces that are holding back investment demand globally.  And, for the United States, I think they also reflect a drag from the external sector.  However, with corporate balance sheets in good shape and global growth firming, I don’t expect a sudden reassessment of risk and a rise in the term premium to result from these sources. I do have some concern that we may see a snapback in term premiums from another source that we’ve touched on a bit already, and that’s the third and final uncertainty I wish to look at, which is the housing sector.  Here I’d say that President Santomero’s comments in some sense preceded and introduced mine.  I don’t doubt that the housing market is slowing somewhat, but I do wonder about the impact of a slowing of house prices and wealth extraction on household saving and consumption.  Here I pick up where Dave left off, which is that the models take a historical norm.  Let’s say we’re at about the 3 percent that Dave indicated.  I think there’s possibly a greater risk, for reasons that Dave has already indicated, that we may find a much stronger impact on the global recognize their economies are different, I am still somewhat troubled by the experience in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands, all of which had an unexpectedly large impact, from a GDP standpoint, from a relatively slow flattening of house prices.  I recognize that these other economies are different from ours, but I’d also say that we’ve seen even in our own economy some nonlinearities that have emerged—for example, as asset prices moved down relatively rapidly—that might have surprised us in the past. So what’s the implication of all of these uncertainties?  I’d like to put three things on the table for this meeting.  First, I continue to believe, as I think the Greenbook or the Bluebook does, that the equilibrium real rate has, in fact, moved down somewhat on average, to lower than it was, let’s say, over the past ten years, with the exception of the recessionary periods of 2001 and 2002.  Second, I firmly believe, as do many of you, that we are well within the range of neutrality at this stage.  And, third, since I would say there’s a great deal of uncertainty here, I want to make sure that what we say, both in word and in deed, reflects a great deal of flexibility.  I heard Vice Chairman Geithner suggest that we want to put out some words that say it’s probable that we’ll move at the next meeting.  I suggest that we be a little more nuanced and put out some words that suggest it’s at least possible that we move at the next meeting. Having said all of that, obviously, I, along with everyone else, think that what happens going forward will be extraordinarily data-dependent.  All the more reason for us to keep, if you will, our powder dry and our options open.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The projections I submitted for this meeting reflected expectations of an economy that probably is operating in level terms somewhere in the years with growth broadly in line with the growth of potential and inflation basically stable.  My forecasts for 2006 are very close to those I submitted last January and June.  That’s partly a product of innate stubbornness.  [Laughter]  But it also reflects the fact that 2005 came in largely as expected—after allowance for hurricanes and an energy shock last year that elevated core inflation and damped growth somewhat compared with our forecasts last January.  This is encouraging in that it suggests that we are not looking at major unexplained and unanticipated forces acting on the economy. At this point, our focus appropriately is on keeping inflation contained.  I see several reasons for optimism in this regard.  One is the performance of core consumer prices and price measures, which continue to suggest that the pass-through of higher energy prices will be limited.  Core inflation was roughly stable last year.  It picked up a bit in the fourth quarter, but that was from unusually low readings in the third quarter.  Declining consumer inflation expectations in the most recent Michigan survey, along with the failure of market-based inflation compensation readings to respond significantly to the substantial run-up in oil prices and higher core readings over the intermeeting period, just reinforce my assessment that any pass-through should be small and limited in duration. As we noted at the last meeting, perhaps the greater threat to sustained good inflation performance comes from possible increases in pressures on resources.  The critical question is whether growth in output close to trend is a reasonable expectation with only modest further policy firming, given the low level of long-term rates, reduced drag from energy prices, and a boost from rebuilding.  I thought it was a reasonable expectation, for a number of reasons.  First, after smoothing through the fluctuations caused by auto incentives and hurricanes, private domestic final slowed from 4¼ percent in the first half of the year to 3 percent in the second half of the year, with every element—consumption, business fixed investment, residential housing investment—moderating.  The staff estimates that about 0.3 of this was due to hurricane effects, but that still leaves underlying private demand slowing to an annual rate of about 3¼ or 3½ percent.  This moderation did not reflect the full effects of our policy tightening, especially on the housing market.  Even well-anticipated increases in the short-term rates seem to be having a significant effect on housing markets, which have become more dependent on adjustable rate mortgages to maintain affordability.  We are just beginning to see the anticipated slowdown in this sector. With growth in consumption and sales constrained by a leveling-out of housing wealth, businesses are unlikely to see the need to step up the pace at which they are adding to their capital stock.  As a consequence, investment growth could slow, at least slightly, over the next few years, reflecting reduced impetus from the accelerator.  Finally, although foreign economies are strengthening some, foreign investment and consumption remain subdued relative to income.  And given our continuing outsized appetite for imports, net exports are unlikely to be putting added impetus to demands on domestic production.  I think there are several upside and downside risks around this picture of growth near potential, as a number of you pointed out.  I agree that the housing market is the most likely source of a shortfall in demand.  I don’t think we can have much confidence about how the dynamics of this market will play out now that it has begun to soften.  My suspicion is that, as little bubbles in the froth are popped, the risks are tilted more toward quite a sharp cooling off than toward a very gradual ebbing of price increases and building activity.  On the other side, it seems to me global demand would be a major upside risk to growth and to price stability.  The extraordinarily rapid rise turnaround in foreign demand and attitudes beyond just a stepwise strengthening of growth.  For now, these remain risks that we’ll need to monitor. In making my forecast, I assumed we would tighten at this meeting, and likely at the next as well, to gain greater assurance that inflation will remain contained over time, consistent with my forecast of a 1¾ percent increase in core prices in 2007.  However, I do see action in March as dependent on the readings we get in coming months.  There is, as usual, considerable uncertainty about the precise nature and magnitude of the risk to the outlook, but we’re dealing with an economic picture that overall is remarkably good and expected to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Reflecting on this situation, among many, many aspects of the past, I end my remarks as I began them:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When I was preparing for this meeting early last week, I was feeling very comfortable with the forecast of good growth in 2006, in the mid-3 percent range near potential, and a modest uptick in core inflation above 2 percent.  As many of you have already remarked, the GDP numbers on Friday made me slightly more pessimistic, both on growth and on inflation.  The surprise drop in government spending, I have full confidence will turn around.  Final sales fell, however, so that all the growth that occurred in the fourth quarter came from inventory growth.  Given that inventory–sales ratios continue to run at historically low levels, though, inventories should continue to be a source of growth going forward.  As many of you also have noted, other indicators show much stronger performance.  Initial unemployment claims, goods orders, capacity utilization, and strong corporate balance sheets—all of them effectively say that we gave me a bit of pause.  We came through two good quarters, the second and third quarters, with very low inflation; but again, the uptick shows how much variability we see around the inflation numbers quarter to quarter and warrants attention. The one area—and I want to second Dave Stockton’s remark—of main concern is the housing market.  Let me talk about it a little differently from some previous comments today.  When we look at the aggregate levels of debt that households have and relative prices, one of the things as an old lender I worry about is the ability to service the debt and the discretionary spending that households have.  While 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rate, 20 percent are variable.  Starting in 2002, we saw a jump in ARMs, taking advantage of the very steep yield curve at the time.  We now are in a period when not only the fancy option ARMs, the exotic products of the past eighteen months, but also the 3/1 ARMs and the five-year ARMS that became very popular in 2002 and 2003 are repricing. If interest rates just hold where they are right now, we estimate that the monthly debt service cost is going to go up by at least 50 percent on that 20 percent of mortgage portfolios.  If you look at the Greenbook, you’ll notice that the financial obligation ratio rose quite substantially in the past six months.  It is now back to the peaks of 2001 and 2002, and we have a lot of mortgages still to reprice.  We also know that some of these exotic mortgages don’t amortize, but they will kick in and start amortization and that will also pull cash out of discretionary spending. In an overall look at consumers, with housing and the cost of heating this winter rising, you’re beginning to see a little caution in the borrowing numbers.  The drop in home equity lines of credit that I mentioned a meeting or two ago now has been sustained through the whole quarter.  So we have actually seen that home equity lines outstanding that have been drawn on have dropped.  slowed to just over 10 percent.  So households are signaling that they’re pulling back on new borrowing, not just in housing but in general.  When you look at the ability of consumers to spend discretionarily out of their monthly take-home pay, these are signals we need to look at.  And the rising fixed payments that they have is something, in looking at the tail of the distribution on housing market risk, that I think is important for that segment of the population going forward. The other sad thing is that this is our last meeting with the Chairman, and I just personally also want to echo some of the comments of my colleagues around the table to thank you for your leadership.  I’ve been very impressed with the kind of atmosphere that I found when I joined during your tenure as leader of this institution.  The integrity with which everything is done, your emphasis on the quality of ideas, and your continuing to search for new ways to look at information—because the economy is dynamic—remind us that we have to watch for new things always evolving.  The collegiality with which you have led this organization has made it enjoyable for all of us to be here.  And finally, as an old risk manager, I was glad to feel right at home with your approach to monetary policy.  [Laughter]  So thank you for your leadership.  It has been a pleasure to have served with you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you so much.  Vincent. MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material that Carol Low handed out during the coffee break.  Judging by the information derived from money market futures plotted in the top panels of your first exhibit, this seems likely to be another of those meetings in which the important part of the discussion is about words, not the upcoming deed.  As can be seen from the bars in the top left panel, market participants put near a 100 percent probability on a ¼ point firming today and high odds on a like-sized move at the March meeting.  Both those probabilities were marked up over the past seven weeks, partly on apparent increased pressures on costs, what with oil and other commodity prices surging and the foreign exchange value of the dollar weakening, and—unfortunately—on market commentary that was taken as having an inside track on your policy choices.  The 3The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). modestly above 4½ percent this spring before turning down late this year.  impetus a bit more intense, the Committee will want the real federal funds rate, the solid black line in the middle panel, more assuredly in a range that is not associated with policy accommodation.  What market participants do not seem to have bought into is the idea that you’ll act like the hypothetical policymakers described in the Bluebook.  The paths for the nominal and real federal funds rates, derived from an optimal control exercise using the version of the FRB/US model endowing policymakers and financial market participants with perfect foresight, are shown in the bottom panels.  The solid and dotted lines are the policy prescriptions under inflation goals of 1½ percent and 2 percent, respectively.  With actual inflation and the FRB/US measure of long-run expected inflation now running around 2 percent, policymakers can hold the nominal funds rate steady and allow the real funds rate to drift lower to achieve 2 percent core PCE inflation in the long run. To induce enough resource slack to work toward a 1½ percent inflation goal, however, policymakers would have to raise the nominal funds rate to about 5 percent.  probably for some combination of three reasons.  The first two explain why—even if your goal for inflation is 1½ percent—you might be less aggressive than in the corresponding simulation.  For one, market participants may see less near-term pressures on inflation than in the Greenbook and its extension.  For another, they may believe you’d tolerate inflation toward the high end of that range, in part because of the perception that you would be unwilling to create economic slack deliberately to achieve a different outcome.  Instead, they may think you are willing to wait for some opportunity in the future, when a negative shock pulls inflation down.  And the third is a reason that—even if you were aiming for inflation of 2 percent—you might be tighter than the corresponding simulation.  In particular, market participants may believe that your policy choice will be shaped by considerations about risks that deterministic simulations cannot capture.  For example, you might be satisfied with inflation around current levels, if it were ensured, but be asymmetrically concerned with regard to its being higher rather than lower.  Thus, you might tighten more than the 2 percent goal simulation as insurance that inflation does not move higher.  If, like market participants, you see yourselves operating in the range between the two paths called for by the optimal control exercises, you most likely would be willing to tighten ¼ point today and place high odds of doing so again in March.  The two chief wording issues that follow from that decision are listed at the top of exhibit 2.  First, how high are the odds you place on tightening at the March meeting?  In writing the Bluebook, we thought you’d want to preserve the current configuration of financial market prices, which appears to be based on a 70–30 split on tightening versus no action in six weeks.  Thus, in the portion of the statement language of alternative B listed in the bottom left, we offered the sentence, “The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the balance.”  We thought that this wording gives a strong presumption that policy will tighten once more but not the certainty that makes many of you uncomfortable.  From what I’ve heard today, I would suggest tweaking that verb phrase to dial down the  The second question is, How strongly do you want to underscore that coming the December statement, also repeated in the bottom left panel, provided sufficient assurance on that score.  Indeed, this layout seemed to have the attraction of expressing a back-up strategy in which you would deviate from the anticipated policy path if events dictate.  We also thought that you’d want to make as few changes to the language as possible today.  An alternative is to reverse the order of the last two sentences, as is done at the bottom right.  “The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability.  In these circumstances, the Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to those objectives roughly in balance.”  Note that the first sentence now describes the baseline assumption, not a contingency plan.  This wording is similar, but not identical, to language circulated by President Poole.  It shares his reordering of the sentences but does not repeat the “measured policy firming” phrase on the logic that the Committee discussion, it would be helpful if you would focus some of your remarks on the two questions I have raised.   With the help of exhibit 3, I now turn to my standard procedure in closing to hector the Committee on some point of governance.  The issue, as I explained in my memo of January 25, is that the statement released this afternoon will likely be only partly covered by the Committee’s vote.  The responses to the survey I sent around earlier indicated significant support for voting on the entire statement but that a minority was decidedly opposed.  Those opposed are primarily concerned that requiring members to agree on all the words in the statement may make it more difficult to reach a consensus.  In addition, the public may be confused if a member dissents, not because of disapproval of the policy action but because of distaste for the words characterizing the action.  Moreover, FOMC participants arguably have more leeway now to offer views to the public differing from those in the statement than would be the case if the entire document had the Committee’s seal of approval.    Those favoring a formal vote on the entire statement hold that all its aspects, including the description of the economy, are important in shaping market expectations about the future path of policy.  In that view, it may be a good thing that the formal vote constrains how members subsequently describe the rationale for policy action to the public, as it would send a more consistent message about the prospects for policy.   alternatives listed in the exhibit:  (1) Vote on the entire statement and the directive.  (2) Vote on the directive and assessment of risks, as now.  But to clarify ownership of the remaining portions of the statement, the Committee could also vote to authorize the Chairman to provide a rationale for that action.  (3) Retain the status quo, perhaps with the issue to be raised again at a later date under the next Chairman.  The two bottom panels present the formal vote for alternative B should you prefer, respectively, option 1 or option 2.  (The language for option 3, as always, is in the Bluebook.)  Students of this institution probably believe that the statement is partly owned by the Committee and partly by the Chairman.  For the rest, what is issued at 2:15 p.m. on the day of decision is a Committee document.  Thus, some people would view option 1 as delimiting the Chairman’s authority, while others would view option 2 as rolling back the Committee’s authority.  It would seem best that such suspicions not be harbored about the new Chairman by resolving this governance issue today if option 2 appeals to you—that is, voting only on the interest rate, not the rationale, portion of the statement and granting the Chairman an explicit authority to craft the rest.  If, instead, you prefer to vote on the entire statement, then I would suggest putting off option 1 to another day—so as not to risk creating a misimpression about your intent.  One such opportunity might be the March meeting.  Ben Bernanke has asked me to relay that he prefers that the next meeting run for two days—Monday and Tuesday, discussions.  The Secretariat will send around formal notice about the logistics of this meeting as soon as possible, subject to a notation vote by this Committee naming a new Chairman.  Some supporting documents for the two-day meeting will then circulate during the intermeeting period.  Your last exhibit repeats table 1.  I should note that we changed the “smoothing” language that few of you favored.  Instead, the rationale portion opens, “Although recent economic data have been uneven.”  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent? MR. LACKER.  How do your inflation expectations evolve in your two simulations, and in particular, how are they affected by policy?  Is it just through the effect of resource slack on actual inflation? MR. REINHART.  In these simulations, long-run inflation expectations evolve very gradually based on the path of actual inflation.  So what happens is in the 1½ percent simulation you work it down. MR. LACKER.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Anybody else?  Do we have copies of the statement?  Could you circulate them, please?  I will be rather brief for a number of reasons, not the least of which is I mostly agree with what has been said around this table and I just don’t want to duplicate it.  I do think that this is an extraordinary economy.  If you look at the world data, the balances out there in Europe and Asia and Japan—remember Japan is the second largest economy in the world, and we used to forget that because it never moved and hence did not contribute to either expansion or contraction.  But it’s clearly now moved beyond its very serious difficulties and is likely to be a positive force, as indeed much of Asia and now, more recently, Europe is beginning to be.  So the outlook out there is benevolent, but benevolence is not something that goes on forever. So far I think it’s fairly clear that there’s consensus around the table that we’ll move 25 basis points today.  And I think that there is an awareness that we’re probably not all that far from where we want to be, considering that our major focus was the removal of accommodation, which we had purposefully put in place to bring the funds rate down to 1 percent over a protracted period.  I think that, at this particular point, whatever the Federal Reserve does henceforth, it is going to become increasingly dependent on the data because we’re not in the position in which we had been for quite a period of time of essentially saying what it is we plan to do and then proceeding to do it.  We have run the string.  We have gotten to where we wanted to be, and now the data are going to determine what largely is going to happen. I don’t think there’s much debate on this particular statement relevant to what the March actual action is going to be.  I suspect that whatever the Committee does in March will depend very work their way through over the next six weeks.  And since we’re not very far from where we would like to be, there’s no real problem here. Therefore, I would venture that we move 25 basis points and that we adopt the language, the critical part being “further policy firming may be needed.”  This language in my judgment is essentially consistent with the outlook as we can best evaluate it, and I would move, in the context of what Vincent has been saying, both the statement and the action and would request that our Secretary read the appropriate language. MR. FERGUSON.  Do you want to go around first? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m sorry.  I’m trying to cut the discussion short. [Laughter] MR. POOLE.  Do you have someplace to go?  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, but I’m looking at the clock. MS. MINEHAN.  The clock, I mean, it has stopped. [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Let the record reflect that the Committee has thwarted the attempt by the Chairman to change the process in a way that— [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually I thought it was elegantly done.  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, I, too, think that we should move by 25 today, and I’m comfortable with the language as it’s modified here.  I do think that it’s important to note that the market judges the odds of March as probable.  The Greenbook assumption is more consistent with that and, as Janet said, some of the Bluebook filters we can use to look at things are slightly more in that direction.  But having said that, I think it’s fine to leave the statement with “may,” and I don’t really know whether the market’s reaction to that statement would take out some of the pricing now built in or leave it where it is.  It’s hard to know. we need to spend much time on it.  I think we should defer this decision until March.  My own view is that the actions the Committee takes are really not principally the changes in the fed funds rate we announce or don’t announce at the meeting.  They have a lot to do with how we characterize our view of the path of output and inflation relative to our objectives, the risks around that, and what we signal, if anything, about the monetary policy implications of that judgment.  Having said that, I think it is hard not to argue that the Committee needs to express a view when it votes on that basic set of signals.  I think it’s worth deferring that judgment, though, simply because we should talk through a little more what it really means for our process and how we’re going to manage the preparation and the discussion in a world where we’re more explicitly deciding what we’re going to vote on.  So my compliments to Vince for framing it the way he did, and I suggest we defer the vote. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree on the second point that we should postpone consideration of what we vote on for the reasons that the Vice Chairman just noted.  I support the increase in the federal funds rate today.  I’m a little concerned, like the Vice Chairman, that this “may” language could cause a bit of a rally in financial markets, but I think it reflects the general tone around the table and is certainly close to my thinking.  I think we’re more likely to have to firm than not at the next meeting—the odds are 50–50 or greater—and this puts the market on notice that that’s approximately what our thinking is.  So I agree with that one. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO.  I support the recommendation in terms of the 25 basis points and also the wording.  I actually like “may” rather than “may well.”  I think the data will in all likelihood be like the ordering as is presented here.  So this fits very well into my view of where we should be.  On the last point, I’d like to compliment Vince for predicting that he will yet again be back talking about it.  [Laughter]  I think that’s the right path.  I think bringing it to everybody’s attention is a good thing.  But your third solution, which is somewhere in between, is actually the right answer.  How one fosters a consensus around that is tricky, and I’m glad I don’t have to do it. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I support the increase of 25 basis points at this meeting.  I would like to add a third question to the two that Vince gave us at the top of exhibit 2.  What language creates the best basis for smooth transition of future language?  Every time we make a change, it gets parsed, examined, cut, read between the lines, and so forth.  So part of my motivation in suggesting the reversal of those two sentences was to make what I thought might be an easier transition in the future.  Clearly, it’s a very fine point, but that’s what we end up dealing with in order not to provide any signals that we didn’t really intend. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Well, I support a 25 basis point move.  I think President Poole has made a good point.  I wrote a note in support of it, but I can accept the language that’s here.  Then, finally, I am in full accord with the President of the Reserve Bank of New York’s articulation of the issue of procedure, which I think we should defer. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recommendation of 25 basis points.  I rather like moving the operative forward-looking language to “may” as opposed to “may well” because I think it frees the markets to look much more at the data, as they would do naturally “may” covers us well enough for March. On the procedural point, I obviously agree with the consensus in the room that we should postpone this until the March meeting.  I must express some uncertainty about how we vote on an entire statement and directive as a group of nineteen.  So I would have a tendency toward the status quo, but that just may be because I’m inappropriately conservative and not appropriately imaginative.  So let me stop at that and move on to the next person. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman, I agree with your proposal.  I’m very pleased with taking the word “well” out just because I think the statement should be giving the market 50–50 odds rather than something greater than that as we look forward.  And we are data dependent.  So I really prefer that.  And I agree with postponing the discussion on procedure for the next meeting.  There’s much to be done, and I think in the transition we need to wait until then. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I find myself in agreement with, I guess, everybody who has already spoken.  The ¼ point increase seems appropriate to me.  I’m comfortable with the language as proposed, and I think we should defer the discussion of ownership of the statement until March. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, am comfortable with your proposal to move 25 basis points today.  I am also comfortable with this language.  I actually could have gone with an even shorter formulation that was on page 22 of the Bluebook, which basically combined rows four and five and didn’t make reference to the need to move further.  But all things being Fifty-fifty?  I don’t know.  I am not sure that it is a 50–50 chance, but maybe it is.  So I am okay with that. On the ownership of the statement, what President Santomero said resonated with me.  I think there is a halfway path here, and the issue needs a little more conversation.  I don’t think it’s something we should decide now.  So we should stay with the status quo. I’d also like to raise some concern if Monday–Tuesday is going to become commonplace.  Monday is a hard day, particularly if you’re not going to give us the Greenbooks and the Bluebooks until late the week before.  I think the timing puts a lot of pressure on everybody that we could alleviate by going with Tuesday–Wednesday. MR. REINHART.  The reason for Monday–Tuesday was that you probably already had travel plans that got you into D.C. on Monday, whereas having to extend to Wednesday might pose more of a hardship.  But it was viewed as just for this meeting. MS. MINEHAN.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support your recommendation on the 25 basis point increase in our fed funds rate target.  I, too, like the language as you proposed it.  Removing the word “well” in the statement gives us, I think, more of the flexibility that I said I desired.  And I, too, would like to defer the decision on what we vote on.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.  I’m comfortable with the language.  Some of the alternative language that has been suggested is attractive.  I think we should make as few changes today as we can, and this recommendation does that.  I also support the Vice statement.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And I also support fully your recommendation with respect to the 25 basis point move and with respect to the language, and I agree with the Vice Chairman’s comments that the discussion about what we should vote on is very important.  It has all become an aspect of policy, but there are a lot of details to discuss, and we should defer a decision on it. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support both the 25 basis point increase and the wording of “may,” and again, I think it would be good to defer the discussion about the implications of the alternatives that Vince has laid out. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, during your tenure the FOMC has been successful in anchoring long-term inflation expectations that are appropriately at low levels, and I think we want to make sure we maintain that legacy going forward.  I continue to be concerned about the possibility that inflation will move up and run above 2 percent for an extended period of time.  So I’m not certain how long we could experience core inflation of more than 2 percent without having inflation expectations rise. But I can agree with your recommendation on the statement.  I think it does enable us to be flexible going forward as to what we’re going to do and does allow for the possibility that we might have to move higher than the Greenbook assumptions.  And I agree on postponing the decision on the broader question of what we vote on at the meetings.  Finally, in the spirit of less is more, I just has been a great privilege to work with you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Olson. MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support both the ¼ point increase and the statement.  I remind my colleagues that in the last two meetings we will have now removed the terms “accommodative” and “measured,” and in combination, that’s a very significant move forward.  We have left ourselves at the point where I think we want to be, with the flexibility moving forward to respond to the data as they come in. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I support a ¼ point move today, Mr. Chairman, and I support the language in this statement.  I’d be ready to support today moving to voting for the whole statement consistent with the global march of democracy, but it’s hard to be against further deliberation, especially within the Federal Reserve System.  So I’ll defer to my colleagues and agree to that course of action.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I gather correctly there’s been no real interest in reversing the paragraphs.  So I think that we can go forward and, as I said before, you may read—[Laughter] MS. DANKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In that the decision has been to go ahead with the status quo in the same way as in the past, I will read the wording out of page 31 of the Bluebook—the directive wording first and the risk assessment second, dropping the word “well.” “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4½ percent.”  And “The Committee judges sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.” Chairman Greenspan  Vice Chairman Geithner Governor Bies Governor Ferguson President Guynn Governor Kohn President Lacker Governor Olson President Pianalto President Yellen          Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I request the Federal Reserve Board to engage in addressing the requests for changes in the discount rate. [Recess] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to accept the discount rate requests of eleven Banks.  As to the date of the next meeting, Vincent will send notice. MR. REINHART.  As soon as we have a new Chairman, which is subject to action by the Senate, signature of the President, and a notation vote by this Committee, I will send a memo around providing the time of the next meeting.  As the agenda is not yet set, I am not quite sure what time it will start. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The meeting is adjourned. END OF MEETING ',\n",

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding strongly in the first quarter.  Consumer spending was on track to rise at a robust pace, and business purchases of equipment and software picked up appreciably.  Warm weather boosted housing construction in January and February, although sales of new homes dropped back and house prices decelerated slightly.  Private payrolls advanced solidly in the first two months of the year.  Headline consumer price inflation jumped in January but moderated in February as energy prices moved down.  Core inflation remained contained.Labor demand continued to increase in the first two months of 2006, as private nonfarm payroll employment showed large gains in both January and February.  With favorable weather conditions, employment growth was especially brisk in the construction sector.  Financial activities, business services, and nonbusiness services also posted solid payroll gains.  Although the average workweek edged down in February, the level of aggregate hours for production and nonsupervisory workers was above its average for the fourth quarter of 2005.  The unemployment rate continued to decline and averaged 4¾ percent over the first two months of the year.  Several other labor market indicators also signaled a further tightening of labor market conditions.Industrial production picked up in February after a modest decline in January.  That pattern was attributable to swings in utilities output, as temperatures were historically warm early in the year before reverting to near seasonal norms in February.  Excluding utilities, industrial production posted a sizable gain in January before flattening out in February, pointing to a solid rise in the first quarter.  Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--slipped in February after registering robust gains in each of the previous three months.  Manufacturing output was unchanged in February after a significant increase in January.  The rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector stood a bit above its long-run average.Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded strongly in the first quarter.  Motor vehicle purchases bounced back in late 2005 and early 2006 from the sluggish pace that followed the end of the past summer\\'s \"employee pricing\" programs.  Excluding motor vehicles, consumption spending was robust, supported by continuing improvement in the labor market and advances in wage and salary income.  The annual raise in the pay of federal employees, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits and other transfer programs, and the initiation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan boosted the level of personal disposable income in January.  Consumption was likely supported also by ongoing increases in home prices and gains in the stock market.  Consumer confidence as measured by surveys remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.Housing activity had moderated somewhat from the robust pace of the past summer.  Although the level of single-family housing starts was unusually high in January and February, much of this strength was likely the result of mild winter weather; new permit issuance extended the downward trajectory that began in October.  After an unusual spike in January, multifamily housing starts dropped back in February to a rate well within their historical range.  Sales of new homes fell in the first two months of the year, while sales of existing homes turned up in February for the first time since last August; both measures were well below their peaks of mid-2005.  The stock of homes for sale was elevated compared with its range of the last several years.  Mortgage applications continued to decline in February, and survey measures of homebuying attitudes also maintained their recent downward trend.  Housing demand was likely damped by rising mortgage rates, which moved up further in late 2005 and early 2006.  House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the rapid pace of the summer, but price increases for both new and existing homes remained well within the elevated range that has prevailed in recent years.Real outlays for equipment and software decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2005 but appeared to have gained strength in early 2006.  This pattern reflected sizable swings in outlays for transportation equipment.  The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost.  Although vacancy rates for nonresidential properties were well below the peaks reached in the first quarter of 2004, real spending on new construction had yet to gain traction.  In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures continued to rise rapidly and appeared poised to increase further in the near term.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of 2005, and inventories appeared to have continued to build in January.  Much of the increase reflected rising prices of goods held, and real inventory accumulation was subdued.  The inventory-sales ratio declined slightly in January, extending its long-run downward trend.  Inventory stocks appeared to be well aligned with demand in most industries.The U.S. international trade deficit rose in the fourth quarter and widened further in January, as gains in exports of goods and services were outweighed by a substantially larger rise in imports.  Exports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and agricultural products picked up robustly in January, while the increase in imports was widespread across most product categories.  Real GDP growth in foreign industrial economies was mixed in the fourth quarter, as economic activity slowed in the euro area and in Canada while the Japanese economy expanded briskly and growth in the United Kingdom firmed.  Recent indicators of economic activity in developing economies were generally quite positive.Readings on core consumer price inflation were favorable in recent months.  Nonetheless, the overall consumer price index edged up in February after registering a large increase in January that was driven mostly by a spike in energy prices.  While prices of food and core items recorded only modest increases in February, energy prices fell back amid increases in oil inventories and unseasonably mild temperatures since the latter part of December.  Weekly data for March, however, indicated that gasoline prices rose sharply.  Prices of capital equipment inched up in February after a more substantial gain in January.  Nevertheless, prices of capital equipment decelerated over the past twelve months.  Higher energy prices still seemed to be passing through to the prices of a number of core intermediate materials, although such increases were more moderate than those observed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes last autumn.  The increase in the employment cost index in the fourth quarter of 2005 was relatively modest.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, after having increased substantially in the third quarter, was estimated to have risen somewhat less in the fourth quarter.  Preliminary survey measures of short-term inflation expectations in March edged up, but longer-term measures remained steady.At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4½ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, although recent economic data had been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.  Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained.  Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance but reiterated that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster its objectives.Investors had largely anticipated both the Committee\\'s interest rate decision at the January meeting and the text of the accompanying statement.  Consequently, the policy announcement elicited little market reaction.  Policy expectations and yields on Treasury coupon securities subsequently firmed, on net, over the intermeeting period, as incoming data indicated robust economic growth in the United States and strengthening expansion abroad.  Yields on investment-grade corporate debt rose roughly in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, while yields on speculative-grade corporate debt were little changed.  Broad stock market indexes were modestly higher amid favorable economic news and lower oil prices, and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated slightly over the period.Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have moderated only a bit in the first quarter from its robust pace in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Net issuance of corporate bonds and expansion of business loans at commercial banks had abated in February and early March after robust growth in January; commercial paper outstanding was about flat in the first quarter.  Household mortgage borrowing was thought to have slowed somewhat in the first quarter in response to increased mortgage interest rates.  Consumer credit rebounded some in January after contracting in the fourth quarter because of elevated charge-offs related to the spike in bankruptcy filings.  Based on monthly Treasury statements, federal debt seemed likely to have accelerated in the first quarter.  On average, M2 grew briskly in January and February.  While liquid deposits expanded moderately, small time deposits and retail money funds advanced strongly, supported by further increases in offering rates.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP expanding briskly in the current quarter.  Economic growth was expected to moderate later this year.  The level of output in the current quarter was estimated to be close to the economy\\'s potential and was anticipated to remain so over the projection period.  Core PCE inflation was expected to move slightly higher in 2006 because of cost pressures induced by high energy and import prices and to step back down in 2007 as these cost pressures were anticipated to abate.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly from the slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year, with aggregate spending and employment expanding briskly in the current quarter.  Growth was expected to moderate to a more sustainable pace later this year.  The ongoing cooling in the housing market would act to restrain residential construction and growth in consumption, but business and household confidence and supportive financial conditions would help to foster growth in employment and incomes, keeping consumption and investment on a solid upward track.  Several meeting participants observed that, although the economy\\'s sustainable potential output could not be observed directly or estimated with precision, historical patterns and recent data suggested that current levels of labor and product market resource utilization were in a zone consistent with little or no remaining economic slack.  The recent behavior of core consumer prices seemed to indicate that any pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices had been limited.  In addition, productivity growth, moderate increases in compensation, contained inflation expectations, and international competition were helping to restrain unit labor costs and price pressures.  Nonetheless, meeting participants generally remained concerned about the risk that possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, could add to inflation pressures.Regarding the major sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that consumer spending appeared to be growing at a solid pace, notwithstanding earlier rises in energy prices.  Contacts in the retail sector reported strong demand, and lending to households seemed to be robust.  However, some automobile dealers reported subdued demand for domestic name-plate products.  In coming quarters, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by continued employment gains, household income growth, and relatively low long-term interest rates, even if gains in housing wealth abated.Meeting participants discussed at some length signs of cooling in the residential real estate market.  Published data on housing starts showed little evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity.  However, anecdotal reports from several markets, surveys of homebuyer attitudes, and data on inventories, home sales, and new home cancellation rates all pointed to a moderation in housing activity.  It was noted that the relatively robust data on construction activity could owe in part to unseasonably warm weather.  Going forward, participants expected a deceleration in house prices to contribute to an increase in the household saving rate and to weigh on consumption growth.  Aggregate demand was also expected to be restrained directly by a softening in the pace of home building.  Moreover, rebuilding following last year\\'s major hurricanes appeared to be proceeding at a slow pace, and so would provide only limited offset to the implications of more fundamental developments in this market.Generally, however, the economic expansion appeared to be broad-based.  Contacts indicated that certain sectors, such as energy and semiconductor production, were particularly strong.  Against this backdrop, robust growth in business spending was seen as likely, even as household spending growth moderated somewhat.  Business capital expenditures, especially on equipment and software, appeared to have considerable momentum, supported by strong corporate profits, exceptionally liquid balance sheets, and greater business optimism.  Some participants indicated that nonresidential construction was in the process of picking up and commercial vacancy rates were declining in some regions.Financial market conditions remained supportive of growth, with long-term rates relatively low, risk spreads in corporate debt markets narrow, and banks seeking lending opportunities.  Merger and acquisition activity was strong and infusions of private equity continued at a rapid pace, but the domestic market for initial public offerings was reported to be quite weak.  Although rates on fixed-rate mortgages remained historically low, some ratcheting up of rates on adjustable-rate mortgages was seen as a factor weighing to some degree on the housing market.  More generally, the effects on spending of the substantial increase in short- and intermediate-term rates since June 2004 had probably not yet been fully felt.There were reports of increased construction by state and local governments, which were benefiting from strong tax collections.  Federal defense expenditures had leveled out.  Foreign economic growth appeared to have strengthened of late, prompting some firming of monetary policy by several foreign central banks.  Nonetheless, increases in imports were expected to continue to outpace increases in exports in coming quarters, trimming the rate of expansion of domestic output.Meeting participants saw both upside and downside risks to their outlook for expansion around the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential.  In the housing market, for instance, some downshift from the rapid price increases and strong activity of recent years seemed to be underway, but the magnitude of the adjustment and its effects on household spending were hard to predict.  Some participants cited stronger growth abroad and robust nonresidential investment spending as potentially contributing more to activity than expected.  It was also noted that an abrupt rise in long-term interest rates, reflecting, for example, a reversion of currently low term premiums to more typical levels, could weigh on both household and business spending.Several participants noted that the labor market had continued to strengthen, with payrolls increasing at a solid pace.  The labor market was now showing some signs of tightness, consistent with a relatively low jobless rate.  There were anecdotal reports of shortages of skilled labor in a few sectors, such as health care, technology, and finance.  Still, participants expressed uncertainty about how much slack remained.  Pressures on unit labor costs appeared contained, despite rising health-care costs, amid continued robust productivity growth and still-moderate increases in several comprehensive measures of compensation growth.In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that data over the intermeeting period, including measures of inflation expectations, suggested that underlying inflation was not in the process of moving higher.  Crude oil prices, though volatile, had not risen appreciably in recent months on balance, and a flattening in energy prices was beginning to damp headline inflation.  In addition, core consumer inflation was flat or even a bit lower by some measures.  Some meeting participants expressed surprise at how little of the previous rise in energy prices appeared to have passed through into core inflation measures.  However, with energy prices remaining high, and prices of some other commodities continuing to rise, the risk of at least a temporary impact on core inflation remained a concern.Participants noted that there were as yet few signs that any tightness in product and labor markets was adding to inflation pressures.  To date, unit labor costs were not placing pressure on inflation, and high profit margins left firms a considerable buffer to absorb cost increases.  Moreover, actual and potential competition from abroad could be restraining cost and price pressures, though participants exchanged views on the extent to which conditions in foreign markets might be constraining prices domestically.  However, participants observed that there was a risk that continuing increases in resource utilization could add to inflationary pressures.  Some participants held that core inflation and inflation expectations were already toward the upper end of the range that they viewed as consistent with price stability, making them particularly vigilant about upside risks to inflation, especially given how costly it might be to bring inflation expectations back down if they were to rise.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4¾ percent at this meeting.  The economy seemed to be on track to grow near a sustainable pace with core inflation remaining close to recent readings against a backdrop of financial conditions embodying an expectation of some tightening.  Since the available indicators showed that the economy could well be producing in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential and that aggregate demand remained strong, keeping rates unchanged would run an unacceptable risk of rising inflation.  Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much, given the lags in the effects of policy.  However, members also recognized that in current circumstances, checking upside risks to inflation was important to sustaining good economic performance.  The need for further policy firming would be determined by the implications of incoming information for future activity and inflation.With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, members expressed some difference in views about the appropriate level of detail to include in the statement.  In the end, they concurred that the statement should note that economic growth had rebounded in the current quarter but that it appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters.  Policymakers agreed that the announcement should also highlight the favorable outlook for inflation and summarize their reasons for that assessment, but that it should reiterate that possible increases in resource utilization, along with elevated levels of commodity and energy prices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  Changes in the sentence on the balance of risks to the Committee\\'s objectives were discussed.  Several members were concerned that market participants might not fully appreciate the extent to which future policy action will depend on incoming economic data, especially when an end to the tightening process seems likely to be near.  Some members expressed concern that retention of the phrase \"some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks...roughly in balance\" could be misconstrued as suggesting that the Committee thought that several further tightening steps were likely to be necessary.  Nonetheless, all concurred that the current risk assessment could be retained at this meeting.The Committee also discussed its experience with the two-day meeting.  Participants agreed that the additional time had facilitated their discussion of the economy, policy, and the wording of the announcement.  It was agreed that, because of scheduling conflicts, the next meeting of the Committee would be held on one day, Wednesday, May 10, 2006.  After experience with that and perhaps the subsequent meeting that is already scheduled for two days, a decision would be taken about the general format of future meetings.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Votes for this action: Messrs.

I will discuss both the baseline outlook and some of the risks to that outlook. As always, the views that I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.Last year was, in some respects, a difficult one for the American people and the economy. As you recall all too well, the hurricanes in the fall inflicted a terrible human toll, in terms of both the number of lives taken and the dislocation of so many people. On the economic side, the storms destroyed residential and business capital along with critical infrastructure and also disrupted economic activity, particularly in the energy and petrochemicals industries and at ports on the Gulf Coast. These effects also contributed to the sharp increase in energy prices that occurred last year. Both the aftermath of the storms and the influence of the higher energy prices are reflected in the slower growth of real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year.Even so, over the course of the year as a whole, real GDP rose a bit more than 3 percent, payroll employment increased significantly, labor productivity posted another solid advance, and the unemployment rate moved down further. Increases in overall consumer prices were boosted by the rise in energy prices, but increases in prices apart from those for food and energy--that is core inflation--remained moderate. In light of the challenges confronting the economy, this was quite a favorable outcome.Moreover, much of the slowdown in growth last quarter reflected factors that are unlikely to persist. First, as I mentioned, the hurricanes significantly damped economic activity in the Gulf Coast region and led to a sharp increase in energy-related imports. Although the recovery of economic activity in the worst-affected areas will take a long time, many of the affected industries, including those in the energy sector, have made considerable progress toward returning their production to normal levels. Second, much of the weakness in consumer spending came from a sharp drop in motor vehicle sales after the end of last summer\\'s employee pricing programs. Third, defense spending, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter, dropped sharply in the fourth quarter. The unwinding of these factors should provide some support to growth of real activity in the near term.Indeed, the most recent data suggest that economic activity in 2006 is off to a solid start. Payroll employment expanded briskly in January--the latest month for which figures are available--on top of sizable gains over the preceding two months. Although these increases contain some bounceback from the effects of the hurricanes, they also likely reflect underlying strength in labor demand--an impression that is corroborated by the recent low readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance. In addition, the underlying pace of activity in the industrial sector has been quite robust recently. Real household spending continued to climb in January; although unseasonably warm weather that month left an imprint on the data, the result suggests some underlying strength in this sector. Housing activity has, on balance, been a bit softer recently but still remains at a high level.Overall, the fundamentals appear sufficient to support continued economic expansion. Underlying productivity growth remains strong, the financial positions of households and businesses remain conducive to spending, and, if we have no further run-up in oil prices, the drag on activity from higher energy prices should diminish over time. And the outlook for activity abroad is quite favorable. In Japan, the expansion appears to be broadening, and signs suggest that the Japanese financial sector may finally be stabilizing. Prospects in Europe are gradually improving, particularly in Germany, after several years of sluggish growth. Many emerging market economies also are doing well, with exports providing a significant boost to activity in these countries. These developments should provide some ongoing support to the U.S. economy.The Inflation OutlookThe continued surge in energy prices was the dominant factor affecting inflation last year. Rising energy prices contribute to consumer inflation in several ways--by boosting prices for gasoline and other energy goods; by raising the price of non-energy goods and services as firms pass on increased energy costs; and by putting upward pressure on expectations of future inflation. Despite those pressures, core inflation has, as I mentioned, remained contained, a result likely attributable to a range of causes.The decline in the economy\\'s energy intensity is one of the factors that has restrained the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation in recent decades. As energy prices started to rise in the 1970s, households responded by purchasing products that were more energy efficient and adjusting their consumption habits in other ways. Businesses responded by designing and purchasing capital goods that were more energy efficient and by redesigning production processes in ways that used less energy. One measure of these changes in energy intensity is the ratio of energy use to real GDP, which has fallen more than half since the mid-1970s.Econometric evidence suggests, however, that the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation has dropped by more than would be implied by the decline in energy intensity. In particular, we often look at forecasting equations for core inflation that include a term for the price of energy, weighted by a measure of energy intensity. Using data for years preceding 1981, the pass-through of energy prices to core prices is large and statistically significant. In the period since 1981, the evidence of pass-through of energy prices to core inflation is more limited. Because the energy-price term in these models already controls for the decline in energy intensity, this result suggests that other factors also are restraining the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation.Although many factors could have led to these results, a likely explanation is that inflation expectations have become better anchored. In the 1970s, monetary policy unfortunately allowed large increases in energy prices to have a persistent effect on inflation, a policy that undercut the Fed\\'s credibility and caused long-run inflation expectations to be more volatile. Since that time, however, the Federal Reserve has been more aggressive in fighting all sources of inflationary pressures, including energy price changes. This effort appears to have paid off not only in low and stable inflation but also in a reduction in the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to energy prices. The reduced sensitivity is evidenced by how little movement has appeared in survey measures in response to the rise in energy prices over the past two years.This same tendency can be seen in longer-horizon measures of inflation compensation derived from a comparison of yields on nominal Treasury securities and those on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which are indexed to a measure of price change. Specifically, for the period five to ten years ahead, the TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation has remained well anchored in recent quarters. Moreover, econometric evidence suggests that since early 2004, energy prices have had only a modest effect on TIPS-based inflation compensation at relatively longer horizons. Because inflation-indexed securities were not issued in the 1970s and early 1980s, we cannot know for sure how these recent effects differ from those that might have operated earlier, but I believe that the difference would be stark.All told, increases in energy prices over the past couple of years probably added about 1/2 percentage point to core inflation in 2005, and the lagged pass-through of past increases in energy prices appears likely to add roughly the same amount this year, provided that energy prices do not rise significantly further.The Term Structure of Interest RatesAnother development that has received considerable attention recently is the term structure of interest rates--the yield curve. Typically, longer-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, so a curve plotting yields would rise as maturity lengthens. However, since late last fall, yields on longer maturities have been equal to or less than those at some shorter maturities, creating a flat to inverted yield curve. Going back to the 1950s, a simple picture suggests that the yield curve tends to invert before recessions. In addition, some academic research, along with recent market commentary, suggests that the shape of the yield curve is a strong predictor of future economic growth.However, the Treasury yield curve is now only slightly inverted between one and five years and is roughly flat beyond that. Moreover, yield curves can be flat or inverted either because short-term interest yields are relatively high or because long-term rates are relatively low. Historically, flat or inverted yield curves owing to unusually high short-term rates have tended to be followed by slowdowns, but that has not been the case for those episodes of inverted yield curves owing to relatively low long-term rates. And, in the current situation, the flatness of the term structure results largely from relatively low long-term yields.In addition, the relationship between the yield curve and future economic growth may have weakened in recent decades because the decline in inflation, the dropoff in the variance of economic growth since the mid-1980s, and financial innovation may have altered the sensitivity of households and businesses to changes in rates. Indeed, in simple regression models estimated with recent data, a change in the slope of the term structure has a smaller effect on economic growth than when the models are estimated with data taken from a longer sample period. And models using the more recent data anticipate more rapid real GDP growth in coming quarters than do models using the longer sample period.The relationship between the yield curve and future growth also appears to depend on the factors that are keeping long-term rates low. Long-term interest rates embody both expectations of future interest rates as well as the amount of compensation demanded by investors for the risk of unanticipated movements in real interest rates and inflation--that is, the term premium. By historical standards, the term premium appears to have come down significantly in recent years and to be quite low. A flat yield curve resulting from low term premiums should have quite different implications for future growth than would a flat yield curve resulting from tight monetary policy. Indeed, an exogenous decline in term premiums would make financial conditions more accommodative and would, other things being equal, be followed by higher growth. To account for these developments, an estimate of the term premium can be added to a simple regression model of the relationship between real GDP growth and the slope of the yield curve. Forecasts of future real GDP growth from this extended model are higher than those from models that include only the slope of the yield curve. And the forecasts from this extended model currently are very close to the private-sector consensus forecast.Thus, we have reasons to believe that the current configuration of the term structure is not signaling an economic downturn. At the same time, the amount of economic stimulus arising from low long-term rates is probably not especially large. Indeed, low long-term rates may be signaling relatively low demand for capital around the world relative to saving, which in turn may reflect a lack of sufficiently attractive investment opportunities. For example, in the United States, the nominal share of business fixed investment in GDP has risen recently only to about its long-run average--a level arguably somewhat lower than might be expected given the low level of long-term interest rates. Because interest rates equilibrate the supply and demand of capital, an excess of desired saving relative to desired investment would tend, all else equal, to hold down long-term rates. In turn, low rates have stimulated activity in areas outside of business investment: Housing has been boosted significantly, and consumer spending may also have received some additional impetus.Some Risks to the OutlookAll told, the U.S. economic expansion appears to be solidly on track. Nevertheless, the outlook for real activity faces a number of significant risks, including the possibility that house prices and construction could retrench sharply and that energy prices could rise significantly further.Housing construction has been a significant source of strength in this expansion, and consequently, some analysts have suggested that a correction in this sector could take a big bite out of growth. By my reading, the incoming data suggest that the housing market has begun to cool somewhat, but they do not point to a sharper falloff. Sales of both new and existing homes have declined in recent months, although they remain at a high level; and after cutting though volatility likely related to swings in weather, housing starts appear to have softened recently. Moreover, other indicators of activity, along with anecdotal reports, also seem consistent with an easing, but not with a sharp downward correction.Of course, house prices may become an area of vulnerability. House prices have increased at a remarkable rate during the past several years, and for some fundamentally sound reasons, including low mortgage rates. However, the possibility remains that the recent run-up in prices may be greater than can be justified by the fundamentals and that increases in house prices may moderate or undergo a sharper adjustment. The latest data on house prices--including the figures released this week--provide a hint that a moderation in house prices, and nothing more serious, may now be under way.The primary channel through which a deceleration or downturn in housing prices would be likely to affect the economy is the so-called wealth effect. That is, the path of house prices directly affects the value of housing wealth, and changes in wealth influence households\\' consumption and saving. Estimates from the Federal Reserve Board staff\\'s large econometric model and from various consumption equations suggest that wealth effects are somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 cents on consumption for every dollar of change in wealth, with roughly half the effect realized within a year.However, these estimates are uncertain, and plausible estimates of the wealth effect range from about 2 cents to 6 cents for every dollar of change in wealth. Moreover, these estimates are obtained from equations that look at changes in total wealth, whereas historically, much of the variation in wealth has reflected movements in equity prices. Although efforts have been made to isolate the effects of changes in different types of wealth, it is difficult to get precise estimates of wealth effects specifically for real estate. And, it is always possible that the effects of housing wealth on consumption might have changed in ways that would be hard to identify using standard econometric modeling techniques. For example, the effects could, perhaps, have increased in the last decade as a wave of financial innovation made it easier and less costly for households to tap accumulated housing equity.A decline in consumer confidence is another channel through which a correction in house prices could affect the economy. In the current situation, a sizable deceleration in house prices could have an outsized effect on consumer confidence and thereby reduce household spending by more than is implied by conventional estimates of the wealth effect.Another possible avenue for gauging the effects of housing prices on the economy is to look at experiences in other countries. House prices have risen markedly in recent years in many industrial countries amid low long-term interest rates, ample liquidity, and steady economic growth. Although movements in real house prices flattened out or turned down in several countries in the first half of 2005, they have since recovered for the most part. Of the countries that have seen recent booms in house prices, Australia has experienced a decline in real house prices over the past year; real prices are down about 3 percent since their peak at the end of 2003. During this period, residential investment contracted, and the growth of real consumption slowed a bit; but the economy continued to grow, in part because investment in other sectors picked up in response to strong global demand.More countries have experienced a slowdown in rates of increase in home prices than experienced an outright decline. For example, in the Netherlands--where residential property prices rose particularly rapidly in the late 1990s--the rate of increase slowed significantly beginning in 2000. In 2002 and 2003, the economy experienced a mild recession, with domestic demand contracting as a result of declines in investment (including residential investment) and contracting consumption. But, even so, the economy started to recover in 2004 and 2005, and house prices there have continued to rise in recent years.In the United Kingdom, house prices also flattened out last year, and this deceleration was accompanied by a slowdown in real consumption growth. More recently, house prices have started rising again, and consumption growth has also picked up.Given the limits of what we know about the future path of housing prices and about the implications of any particular house-price scenario for real activity, the Federal Reserve will have to continue monitoring this area closely.Further increases in energy prices are another risk to the economic outlook. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from around $30 per barrel in December 2002 to around $65 per barrel in mid-August 2005, shortly before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall. Since the storms hit, prices have fluctuated widely in response to developments in both domestic and foreign oil markets and recently stood a bit below pre-Katrina levels. Over the same time period, prices of far-dated futures contracts have also risen a substantial amount. As oil prices have pushed higher since late 2003, prices of natural gas also have trended up sharply. And storm-related disruptions to natural gas production as well as weather patterns this winter have caused considerable volatility in natural gas prices.Economic theory suggests that energy price hikes of this magnitude should have an important contractionary effect on the economy by reducing the purchasing power of households and holding down business profits outside the energy sector. Persistently higher oil prices also likely reduce labor productivity and potential output over time as firms adjust their production processes to use less energy. As for the reduction in aggregate demand, higher energy prices increase the bill for imported oil and natural gas, which can be viewed as a \"tax\" on U.S. residents by foreign energy producers, thereby holding down aggregate demand. Given the rise in energy prices since 2003, the import \"tax\" has risen more than $150 billion annually. Although they are imprecise, simulations from the Federal Reserve Board staff\\'s large-scale econometric model, which account for these effects, suggest that increases in spot and futures prices of energy from late 2003 to the present subtracted a 1/2 percentage point from real GDP growth in 2004 and more than 1 percentage point in 2005. The model suggests the subtraction this year will be about a 1/2 percentage point.In addition to their effect on economic activity, further increases in energy prices also pose a risk to the inflation outlook. Looking ahead, the path of far-dated futures prices for oil indicates that markets are not expecting prices to rise significantly further. However, given strong global demand for energy resources and the ever-present risk of supply disruptions, additional increases in energy prices cannot be ruled out. Such increases would boost the overall inflation rate and might put additional upward pressure on production costs and inflation expectations, which in turn, could create forces that would tend to push core inflation up. If that were to occur, the Fed would need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that inflation remained under control.Where Do We Go From Here?As you know, the Federal Reserve seeks to foster price stability and to promote sustainable growth in output, and the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are committed to achieving these objectives. Translating these general economic objectives into operational decisions about monetary policy poses many challenges, and no simple toolkit of economic and financial indicators or economic models can provide reliable guidance at all times. Rather, the FOMC must assess the implications of a wide range of developments and data as well as rely on the best modeling that the economics profession can provide.In the current situation, the economic expansion appears to be on track and core inflation has remained moderate. As I indicated, significant risks, if realized, could alter this generally sanguine outlook, and the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments closely. Given the considerable uncertainties facing the economy and the outlook for policy, policy decisions in coming months will depend heavily on the implications of incoming economic data for future growth and inflation.Footnote Good morning. I am pleased to join you today to discuss matters of mutual interest to the Federal Reserve and community banks; to learn more about your business; and, I hope, to meet many of you in person.Community banks have long played a critical role in the U.S. economy, and this is no less true in the twenty-first century. Today, I will begin by making some observations, based in part on research done at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, about the health of community banks and their evolving role in our economy. Community banks are generally doing quite well, and I expect that good performance to continue. But community banks also face a changing business environment that presents a number of important long-run challenges. In the second portion of my remarks, I will speak a bit about how the Federal Reserve, as the supervisor of many community banks, is also adjusting to a changing environment, and I will review some of the key financial risks facing community banks.Developments in Community BankingBy a wide variety of indicators, the overall performance of community banks in recent years has been quite strong. Average return on equity (ROE), for example, following a decline associated with the 2001 recession, remains solid and indeed has shown a slight upward trend. Return on assets for community banks as a whole demonstrates a similar pattern and has stayed well above traditional benchmarks of strong performance. Net interest margins remain higher than those of the largest banks, and this gap has even widened since 2003. Various measures of loan quality for community banks have been robust, and bank failures have been rare. Equally important, both our on-site examinations and our off-site surveillance system, which uses statistical models to attempt to flag emerging weaknesses at community banks, detect signs of potential problems at very few banks. Consistent with this view, community bank capital ratios remain impressively high, and community banks\\' ability to attract deposits continues to be a source of strength.One strong indicator of the continued health of community banks is the rate at which new banks continue to be created. For example, if we define a community bank as any bank or thrift organization with total real (2002) assets of a billion dollars or less, slightly more than 700 community banks were formed from the beginning of 2000 through 2005, an average of about 120 per year. Clearly, many people remain willing to invest in the future of community banking. The Board has long taken the view that community banks will remain a vigorous and innovative sector of the economy. I think that forecast remains a good one today.All of this is good news. But I am sure that many in this audience would agree that community banks also face serious challenges. Expansion of the geographic scope of banking activities, rapid technological change in the production of financial services, the increasing importance of nonbank providers, and evolving patterns of economic growth are among the factors that are changing the banking marketplace. And, while many of these changes have improved the efficiency of our financial system and lowered costs for consumers, it is only realistic to acknowledge that they also present new and sometimes daunting tests for community banks.Indeed, we have seen major shifts in the structure of the U.S. banking industry in recent decades. Under the same definition of community banks that I used a moment ago, the share of banking industry assets held in community banks has fallen from about 20 percent in 1994 to a little more than 12 percent in 2005. In addition, the number of community banks has dropped from more than 10,000 in 1994 to about 7,200 in 2005. Other definitions of community banks and other structural measures, such as the share of total deposits, also show declines in recent years.Most of this consolidation is a result of mergers. A recent study by a member of the Federal Reserve Board staff shows that between 1994 and 2003 there were more than 3,500 bank and thrift mergers (Pilloff, 2004). In about 92 percent of these mergers, the target institution had one billion dollars or less in total assets. Although bank merger activity has generally declined since the late 1990s, at least 200 deals were completed in each year from 2000 through 2005.The Evolution of Relationship FinanceThese developments notwithstanding, research by our staff and other economists supports the view that community banks continue to play an important role in the provision of financial services, particularly to small businesses, but also to a wide range of retail customers nationwide. Indeed, conventional wisdom in the research community is that \"the central principle of community banking is \\'relationship finance\\'\" (DeYoung et al., 2004, p. 81). By relationship finance I mean financial services whose value-added depends importantly on the ongoing personal interactions of bankers with their customers, interactions that improve the flow of information and allow for more customized services. Relationship finance strengthens the economy by allowing credit and other financial services to be provided more efficiently.But recent research also confirms what many community bankers tell us--that traditional notions of relationship finance are changing, along with the nature of community bank-customer relationships.The conventional research paradigm included the idea that small businesses and households tend to be informationally \"opaque\"; that is, information about these potential borrowers can be costly to obtain and hard to quantify. According to this view, the efficient supply of credit to such parties required close interactions to elicit \"soft,\" or qualitative, information, such as the personal characteristics of the borrower or relevant aspects of local markets and opportunities. This paradigm holds that large banks have a comparative advantage lending to those relatively transparent customers from which they can obtain \"hard,\" or quantitative, information, such as standardized accounting data, and community banks have a comparative advantage lending to relatively opaque small businesses and households.However, this division of labor between large and small institutions has begun to blur. Today, practitioners and researchers understand that low-cost information processing, improved credit-scoring, and more sophisticated management techniques are rapidly reducing the effective opacity of many small businesses and households. Credit card lending provides an example of this phenomenon. Technological and financial innovation, including credit scoring, securitization, and economies of scale in data processing, have combined to make credit card lending a hard-information, transactions-driven business, quite different from traditional unsecured personal lending, which relies heavily on personal knowledge and relationships.Some recent data from the Board\\'s forthcoming Survey of Small Business Finances sheds some light on how the marketplace, and the role of community banks, is changing. The Board conducts this survey every five years. Our most recent data, which are still preliminary and will be released later this year, are for year-end 2003; they are the result of interviews with more than 4,200 small businesses that represent an estimated 6.3 million small businesses in the United States. The surveys show that small businesses are heavy users of financial services. For example, the proportion of these businesses using some type of financial service at a bank or thrift rose from 92 percent in 1998 to 96 percent in 2003. Increases occurred across a broad range of financial services and were especially strong in the area of \"financial management services,\" which includes activities such as check clearing, cash management, letters of credit, and credit card processing.According to the surveys, community banks remain an important provider of these services, albeit in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Among small businesses that reported using a bank or thrift in 2003, about 37 percent used a community bank, down from about 42 percent in 1998. Over the same period, the share of small businesses using a financial service supplied by a nondepository institution rose from 40 percent to 54 percent.Although these surveys show that community banks face increasing competition, including from nondepository providers, they also highlight the importance of one of the traditional strengths of community banks: local presence. For example, in 2003 the median distance between a small business\\'s headquarters and its bank or thrift was three miles, about the same as in 1998. Indeed, part of the success of nondepository institutions may have been due to the fact that the median distance between a small-business customer and its nondepository service provider fell from 83 miles in 1998 to 37 miles in 2003, with most of the change resulting from greater proximity of customers to nondepository loan providers. Being close and convenient is important.Data collected as part of the banking agencies\\' Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) activities also demonstrate the importance of proximity. As you know, the CRA focuses on banks\\' lending and services provided within their local communities. From CRA and other data, we can estimate the share of loans to small businesses made by depository institutions located physically within the local market area. These data show that between 1996 (the year we began collecting such data) and 2004, the competition from out-of-market lenders has increased, a result that will not surprise you. However, in value terms, the share of small-business loans made by out-of-market firms did not exceed 18 percent in any year. Small-business owners look overwhelmingly to local lenders for credit.We see that, for community banks, the overall picture is complex. In financial terms, community banks remain quite strong, and there is considerable entry into the business. New technologies and management methods have eroded some of the traditional informational benefits of relationship finance, however, and community banks have lost market share to larger banks and to nondepository institutions. But the data also show that many customers want to be served locally; they value proximity and convenience. In my view, the strong relationships and personalized services provided by community banks remain an important reason for their continuing success.Supervisory PerspectivesLike community banks, bank supervisors must also adapt to a changing financial and economic environment. I would like to discuss some of the ways in which the Federal Reserve\\'s supervision of community banks has evolved in recent years and also briefly review some of the key financial risks that we see in our examinations.In the 1990s, bank supervisors began to take a more proactive, risk-focused approach. Under this approach, examiners focus their on-site reviews on those activities that appear to pose the greatest risks to each individual banking organization, with particular attention to the bank\\'s procedures for evaluating, monitoring, and managing those risks. The objective is to address weaknesses in management and internal controls before, rather than after, financial performance suffers.In adapting to change, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have also consistently kept in view the competitive pressures that community banks face, pressures that make the costs of regulation an important concern. Whenever possible, we have streamlined procedures and worked to eliminate unnecessary burden. For example, based on industry feedback and supervisory experience, the Federal Reserve recently modified its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to raise the asset size used to define eligible companies from $150 million to $500 million. These revisions address changes in the industry and in the economy since the initial issuance of the policy statement in 1980. While the bank holding companies (BHCs) affected hold only 6 percent of total BHC assets, this change increases the exempt group to roughly 85 percent of all BHCs, thereby providing some burden relief to many smaller companies. These companies will be exempt from consolidated risk-based capital guidelines and will be allowed to file abbreviated semiannual reports in place of consolidated quarterly financial statements. Under the policy statement, the exemption would not be extended to holding companies with significant nonbank or off-balance-sheet activities or that have material amounts of public debt or equity securities outstanding. Of course, we and the other banking agencies will vigorously enforce prudential capital standards for all deposit-taking institutions, including those owned by the exempt BHCs.Supervisors have sought to adjust regulatory procedures to account for the needs of community banking organizations in other ways. As you are no doubt aware, in tandem with the review of capital standards for the largest banks, known as Basel II, the federal banking agencies are taking a comprehensive look at additional possible changes to existing regulatory capital guidelines for banks that would not adopt the proposed Basel II revisions. These possible changes to Basel I would seek to increase the risk sensitivity of the framework and to help mitigate any competitive inequities that could result from the implementation of Basel II.The recent update to the CRA regulations provides another example in which regulators have taken into account the special features of community banks. Last year, the Federal Reserve and other federal agencies issued final CRA rules that reduced compliance burden by creating a new category of intermediate small banks with assets between $250 million and $1 billion. Banks in this new category now face reduced requirements for data collection and reporting, and they have become eligible for a two-pronged set of CRA tests--a streamlined lending test and a community development test--rather than the three-part CRA criteria that larger banks must meet. These changes are intended to reduce the costs borne by smaller banks and to increase flexibility while still achieving the community development objectives of CRA.To target examination resources and to limit the burden of on-site reviews, the Federal Reserve also has increasingly relied on automated off-site monitoring tools. For example, since the late 1990s, the Federal Reserve has supervised many small bank holding companies using an off-site review program. We support this program with a targeted monitoring system that seeks to identify parent company and nonbank issues that may adversely affect affiliated insured depository institutions. This program enables us to limit on-site reviews to those bank holding companies with characteristics that could pose risks to insured depositories. We also use statistical models to monitor the condition of state member banks and quickly address any issues that emerge between regularly scheduled on-site examinations. This year, we substantially updated these models to improve their performance. Thanks in large part to such efforts, examiners today conduct more of their supervisory activities offsite, helping to reduce the burden that is associated with on-site examinations at institutions like yours.Beyond these changes, the Federal Reserve is participating in an ongoing interagency review of banking regulations pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA. This review seeks to identify opportunities to streamline regulatory procedures and requirements when such changes would be consistent with maintaining bank safety and soundness. The Board has also supported various legislative changes that would ease regulatory burden. These include a recently proposed change that would permit supervisors to extend the time between on-site examinations to eighteen months for well-managed and well-capitalized banks with up to $500 million in assets. This change would double the current size threshold and has the potential to allow roughly 1,200 more community institutions to qualify for the extended examination cycle.In my remaining time, I would like to discuss some of the key financial and risk-management challenges that we have identified through our supervisory activities.Banking has always been a business of taking and managing risks, but evolving market and economic conditions affect the types of opportunities available. In recent years, community banks have become more focused on commercial real estate lending, leading to a significant shift in the balance sheet and risk profiles of growing numbers of banks.In most local markets, commercial real estate loans have performed well. Our examiners tell us that lending standards are generally sound and are not comparable to the standards that contributed to broad problems in the banking industry two decades ago. In particular, real estate appraisal practices have improved. However, more recently, there have been signs of some easing of underwriting standards. The rapid growth in commercial real estate exposures relative to capital and assets raises the possibility that risk-management practices in community banks may not have kept pace with growing concentrations and may be due for upgrades in oversight, policies, information systems, and stress testing.In response to these developments, the federal banking agencies have recently proposed guidance that would focus examiners\\' attention on those loans that are particularly vulnerable to adverse market conditions--that is, loans dependent primarily on the sale, lease, or refinancing of commercial property as the source of repayment.I emphasize that, in proposing this guidance, supervisors are not aiming to discourage banks from making sound loans in commercial real estate or in any other loan category. Rather, we are affirming the need for each bank to recognize the risks arising from concentration and to have in place appropriate risk-management practices and capital levels.Adjusting to changes in the level of short-term interest rates can also pose challenges to community banks. Thus far, the relative stability of community bank net interest margins suggests that they have done a good job of managing their interest rate risk exposure throughout the recent increase in market rates. Importantly, most community banks have effectively controlled the maturity distributions of their assets and made significant improvements over the past decade to their management and measurement of interest rate risk. Certainly, the procedures employed by community banks today are significantly more effective than those typically used as recently as a decade ago. However, we continue to see a small number of institutions with concentrations in longer-term assets. In these cases, our examiners encourage banks to gauge the risks of new yield-enhancing strategies over the intermediate and longer terms.The unique funding structure of community banks supports their strong recent performance. For the most part, community banks continue to fund themselves primarily with relatively low cost and stable \"core\" deposits. However, a limited segment of community banks is increasing its reliance on wholesale sources of funding. Greater reliance on these sources places a premium on appropriate measurement and management of liquidity risk. Most community banks manage their liquidity risk positions well, but supervisory reviews suggest that some institutions have room for improvement. With the banking system enjoying a period of relatively high liquidity, now is a good time for all companies to assess the adequacy of their processes for managing liquidity risk.I emphasize that, on the whole, we do not have broad supervisory concerns with community banks. But it is only prudent to reiterate the importance of sound risk management to the continued success of community banks.ConclusionIn closing, I want to return to where I began. In my judgment, well-managed and innovative community banks will continue to play a critical role in the U.S. economy. Community banks provide vital services for their customers and are key contributors to sustained economic growth, both locally and nationally. Indeed, the performance of community banks over the past decade has been very impressive. But neither bankers nor their supervisors should become complacent. Doubtless the future will continue to require both of us to evaluate and respond to changes that are often complex and difficult to understand, much less to predict. It has been my pleasure to be here today, and I look forward to working with you in the coming years to ensure the continued vitality of the U.S. banking and financial system.Thank you.ReferencesDeYoung, Robert, William C. Hunter, and Gregory F. Udell (2004). \"Whither the Community Bank?\" Journal of Financial Services Research, vol. 25 (April/June), pp. 81-84. It is a pleasure to join you for this joint Roundtable on Financial Reporting and Auditing. As chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, I would like to express my appreciation to all of you that are participating in this roundtable as distinguished speakers or in other roles. In addition, I appreciate the very good partnership that we have had with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)), and with our host, the World Bank, in preparing for this gathering.Since our last joint Roundtable in October 2004, much has transpired in the international accounting and auditing arenas. Indeed, 2005 was a very big implementation year for international standards around the world. The topics of this Roundtable--dealing with the experience of implementing IASB and IFAC standards and related regulatory challenges, international convergence and harmonization, issues associated with using fair values in the financial reporting model, and risks and vulnerabilities arising from the financial reporting chain--all reflect the interconnectedness of accounting, auditing, and regulation and the need to consider these issues from the unique perspectives that all of you bring to the table. It is very important that this type of constructive dialogue continues to take place among the many key stakeholders in the financial reporting chain.The focus of the roundtable--international financial reporting and auditing--continues to gain increased attention from members of the international regulatory community such as the Financial Stability Forum, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the Basel Committee as well as from national supervisors, standards setters, banks, investors, analysts, auditors, and many others. As we all know, in recent years, accounting and auditing scandals and other developments have found their way onto the front pages of your daily newspapers in ways rarely seen before. These challenging developments have led to a new resolve on the part of governmental, regulatory, and business leaders that there must be a reinforcement and improvement of standards-setting processes and a return to sound accounting, auditing, and disclosure practices by companies and their auditors.The unprecedented problems of a few years ago fueled efforts to help restore investor confidence in U.S. and European capital markets through legislative reforms affecting both the accounting profession and corporate management and directors. For example, these efforts led to, for example, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States which set the stage for a new audit oversight authority--the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board--to regulate, inspect, report on, and in some cases enforce penalties against auditors and led to new requirements for corporate management to maintain strong internal controls and to make periodic public reports on the adequacy of their companies\\' internal controls. In the European Union, the Eighth Directive and other initiatives were undertaken in recognition of the important role of audit oversight authorities. These initiatives seek to strengthen accounting standards, internal controls, and transparency.But long before these legislative initiatives were being considered, steps were taken to establish independent international standards-setting frameworks for both accounting and auditing standards, as reflected by the creation of the IASB in 2001 and the IFAC International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (or IAASB). Both of these standards-setting processes have been reviewed and enhanced over time and continue to be subject to improvements.In his keynote speech earlier today, Michel Prada shared with you IOSCO\\'s initiatives to address international accounting and auditing issues. It is clear that IOSCO has played a very important role in these arenas for many years. Likewise, central banks and banking supervisors have taken steps to enhance their focus on accounting and auditing matters that affect institutions they supervise. During the mid-1990s, the Basel Committee started to devote more resources to developing principles that would help shape and improve bank disclosure, supervisory reporting, and accounting practices. Moreover, the committee recognized that it was also important to support high-quality standards-setting processes. With the formation of the Accounting Task Force by the Basel Committee in 1997, the Basel Committee began to participate more actively in processes for setting accounting and auditing standards. This participation led to the development of enhanced accounting guidance on financial instruments and more comprehensive bank audit guidance. The IAIS has also shown a strong interest in the development of sound international accounting and auditing standards, as evidenced by its participation in the IASB\\'s Insurance Working Group and the recent Group of Thirty (G-30) effort to enhance the transparency of reinsurance activities.All of these positive efforts by regulators and supervisors reflect a growing recognition that sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure by banking and other financial organizations and by nonbanking companies can improve market discipline. With sufficient, accurate, and relevant information, market participants can better evaluate counterparty risks and adjust the availability and pricing of funds to promote better allocation of financial resources. Thus, more-effective market discipline can, in a sense, \"regulate\" the risk-taking activities of banks and other firms in ways that can complement supervision and regulation of financial institutions and foster stable financial markets.The concept of market discipline has assumed greater importance among international banking supervisors with the publication of the new International Capital Framework, called Basel II, which seeks to strengthen the market\\'s ability to aid bank supervisors in regulating capital adequacy. As you know, in addition to pillars on risk-based capital requirements (pillar 1) and risk-based supervision (pillar 2), Basel II includes the very important pillar 3, which addresses disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline. This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be important parts of the global bank supervisory approach for many years to come.In addition to disclosure and market discipline, supervisors and regulators around the world recognize the need for stronger audit and control standards for financial services firms and other companies. The quality of management information and supervisory and financial reporting is dramatically affected by internal control systems, including internal audit programs and reviews by external auditors. Sound supervisory and financial reporting, good internal controls, and quality audits are becoming more important to financial services regulators because they directly affect regulators\\' ability to promptly identify institutions in distress and work toward a satisfactory resolution.This shared understanding of the importance of sound audit and control practices led to an unprecedented level of cooperation among the international regulatory community--in this case, IOSCO, the Basel Committee, the IAIS, the European Commission (EC), the World Bank, and the Financial Stability Forum, which came to be known as the Monitoring Group. Working together, they were able to develop a common position on reforms. This common position served as a basis for dialogue with the leadership of IFAC about establishing a credible independent oversight authority to help enhance the integrity and objectivity of the IAASB\\'s international audit-standards-setting processes. This led to the creation of the new Public Interest Oversight Board of IFAC, which is now busy assuming its new responsibilities. The Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) should, over time, lead to enhanced audit standards and practices around the world. The Financial Stability Forum is pleased to have been a strong supporter of this initiative, and I am happy to see that the PIOB is represented at this roundtable today together with the leaders of IFAC and many Monitoring Group representatives.The Financial Stability Forum has taken a close interest in national and international efforts to strengthen confidence in financial reporting frameworks. Stronger and more-convergent national systems bring clear financial stability and efficiency benefits. The forum\\'s efforts have included a focus on the global-standards-setting activities of the IASB on the accounting side and the IAASB on the auditing side. The goal of global standards in both areas will require a high degree of convergence between U.S. and international standards, and efforts toward full commonality are well underway. The forum\\'s interest reflects the strong recognition of its members that the potential financial stability and efficiency benefits are significant: high-quality global accounting standards can lead to enhanced transparency that will improve market discipline and foster stable financial markets. Likewise, external audits performed in accordance with high-quality global audit standards can ensure that financial statements are reliable, transparent, and useful to the marketplace, thus enhancing market confidence.I am sure that we all want to see, over time, a restoration of public confidence in the quality of financial reporting and auditing, and I hope that dialogue--such as that taking place at this roundtable--and the initiatives of standards setters, can lead to standards that are fully understandable to preparers, users, and auditors; that avoid undue complexity and implementation costs; and that truly contribute to transparency. Let me also stress the need to continue to implement approaches that not only improve international accounting and audit standards, but also encourage, through the implementation and enforcement of these standards, an enhancement in actual international accounting and audit practices.However, like any professional undertaking, developing accounting and auditing standards and practices can be complicated, and gaining a shared understanding of the implications for the financial reporting chain and for financial stability can take time. Therefore, I am pleased to see that the Financial Stability Forum, the IASB, and IFAC conducted this roundtable on important financial reporting and auditing matters and that you are taking the time to contribute to the exchange of valuable information on key issues. I hope that this roundtable will continue to foster constructive dialogue among the many key stakeholders represented here and that this type of dialogue will continue after the roundtable has ended. Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. Over the past twenty years, I have attended many of these Institute of International Bankers (IIB) spring conferences in Washington, D.C., either as a speaker or a participant. These meetings continue to address interesting and pertinent issues. The consistently larger number of attendees at a meeting here in Washington, as opposed to a meeting in one of the more dynamic international financial centers like New York or Los Angeles, reflects this group\\'s clear recognition that public policy has a direct impact on the viability of your respective institutions. Appropriately, most of the topics presented over these two days cover legislative and regulatory issues intermixed with critical strategic issues. For my presentation, I will revisit a topic initially raised twenty-four years ago by a former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, E. Gerald Corrigan. In 1982, Jerry Corrigan, then the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, wrote an essay entitled \"Are Banks Special?\" for the Bank\\'s annual report. Today I would like to revisit the issue and ponder the question \"Are Banks Still Special?\"I realize that some of you may be wondering why a focus on the specialness of the domestic U.S. banking industry would be an appropriate topic at a meeting of foreign bank representatives. There are several reasons why the subject is relevant to this group. First, U.S. laws and regulations for foreign banks adhere to the fundamental principle of national treatment. That is, our regulations allow foreign banks to have the same range of product authority as domestic banks. Therefore, any change in policy that affects domestic banks will also potentially affect the range of products foreign banks may offer. Another reason why the issue is likely to be of interest to this audience is that, in any discussion of product authority or regulatory structure, the experiences of other nations are often used as examples. These examples are often presented as policies or practices to be avoided or emulated. But the accuracy of the facts presented to support or oppose other countries\\' experiences is not always clear. At times, these \"facts\" may be undocumented generalities or even wild speculation.Let me return to Corrigan\\'s essay. In 1982, the banking industry was facing an identity crisis unlike any it had faced since the Depression era fifty years earlier. Within a period of a few months in the mid-1930s, Congress (1) required the separation of banking from many securities functions by passing the Glass-Steagall Act, (2) provided protection for bank depositors by passing the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and (3) authorized the creation of a dedicated home mortgage lender by passing the Home Owners\\' Loan Act. Through these laws, Congress established the legal framework that clearly delineated the competitive relationship for the securities, banking, and thrift industries for close to fifty years. This delineation extended to the marketplace for the banking and securities industries. During this period, there were few issues of controversy between banks and securities firms, the most notable exception being the narrowly focused but heated disagreement as to whether banks should be allowed to underwrite revenue bonds. The Glass-Steagall Act specifically authorized banks to underwrite general obligation bonds, but the act was silent on the issue of revenue bonds. The banking industry viewed that as an oversight; the securities industry viewed it as a purposeful exclusion. This debate went unresolved until 1999, when the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifically authorized revenue bond underwriting by banks. In contrast to the relative peace between banks and securities firms, the competition for deposits between banks and thrifts was quite strong and intensified with the imposition of Regulation Q. Not only did Regulation Q establish ceilings on interest rates for both passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), the regulation gave thrifts an interest rate advantage of initially 50, then 25, basis points for each of their interest-bearing products. The intense marketplace competition between banks and thrifts was matched by the level of competition in the halls of Congress. Bankers aggressively worked to eliminate that quarter-point rate differential, while thrifts worked equally hard to preserve it.Such widespread competition was nonexistent between the securities and banking industries. From the 1930s to the late 1970s, there seemed to be a clear distinction between investment and savings or at least between investment dollars and savings dollars. Savings dollars were held in passbook accounts or CDs, and were insured up to certain limits by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) insurance. Investment dollars were in equities or bonds. Banks and thrifts waged a turf war against each other, but neither industry aimed its marketing guns or lobbying efforts at the securities industry. Then along came money market mutual funds, or money funds.High interest rates during the late 1970s and early 1980s had a stunning effect on the flow of deposits into banks and thrifts. Money fund shares issued by investment firms offered market interest rates and a high level of liquidity, through either immediate withdrawal or the ability to effect transactions by using payable-through drafts. By contrast, Regulation Q mandated low interest rates on passbook accounts, specific term restrictions on CDs, and significant penalties for early withdrawal. Money funds offered rates that were at times double the rates on passbook accounts. The banking industry had no products to counter the market appeal. Even though money funds shares are not federally insured, billions of dollars flowed into the accounts. In 1981 alone, $109 billion flowed into money funds. After a tepid and wholly unsuccessful effort by bankers to restrict the growth of money funds, the banking industry began considering a different response. Now that the securities industry had successfully breached the separation between banking and savings by allowing consumers to invest in money funds, the banking industry was forced to examine its fundamental marketplace role. During that period, I was the vice chairman, then the chairman, of the Governmental Relations Committee of the American Bankers Association. At meetings held between 1980 and 1982, as many as 400 bankers representing institutions of all sizes and markets gathered to consider an industry response. Congress\\'s response to the growth of money funds was to pass the Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982. Taken together, these laws, along with other provisions, eliminated many of the rate and term restrictions on banks\\' and thrifts\\' deposit taking and allowed both types of institutions to offer products that could match the rate and liquidity provisions of money funds. But it was clear to many bankers that a lasting response to marketplace changes would require more than just the removal of Regulation Q. Bankers were seeking answers to such basic questions as \"What is a bank?\" and \"What is the public purpose of banking?\" Jerry Corrigan\\'s essay proved to be a beacon of rationality in that discussion.Are Banks Special? Corrigan identified three characteristics that made banks special:-Corrigan\\'s second criterion identified banks as critical backup sources of liquidity. In fact his essay stated that \"banks are the primary source of liquidity for all other classes and sizes of institutions, both financial and nonfinancial.\"-The third characteristic Corrigan identified is that banks \"are the transmission belt for monetary policy. That role combined with operating the payments mechanism permit the highly efficient financial markets to function and effect the orderly end of day settlement.\"Separation of Banking and CommerceThe appropriate separation of banking and commerce is a delicate proposition that has both historical and philosophical underpinnings. The term \"separation of banking and commerce\" can mean different things, depending on the perspective of the person using the term. At the time of Corrigan\\'s essay--the early 1980s--the statutory authority for that separation was largely contained in two laws: the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from certain investment and securities activities, and the Bank Holding Company Act (with amendments), which narrowly limited the activities of corporations that were allowed to own banks. When it passed in 1956, the Bank Holding Company Act was thought to have been in response to one company\\'s aggressive expansion into banking activities. That company, Transamerica Insurance, had expanded into several western states and concerns were raised about the resulting concentration of financial resources. Therefore, the ensuing body of law on the commerce and banking issue concentrated significantly on separating, or was inspired by desire to separate, banking from securities or banking from insurance. From the time of Corrigan\\'s essay until passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the banking industry had expanded substantially into both the securities and insurance agency fields, though significant restrictions still remained.Much of the industry\\'s expanded securities authority was gained through the Federal Reserve\\'s approval of securities underwriting for banks, under Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act. Under the Federal Reserve\\'s rule, a bank subsidiary was \"not engaged principally\" in securities underwriting if at first 5 percent, then 10 percent, and ultimately 25 percent of its revenue came from underwriting. This expanded authority allowed many banking organizations, though almost exclusively large banks, to significantly expand their domestic securities activities. These same powers were extended to foreign banks operating in the United States.In insurance, gains for the banking industry were largely the result of court determinations that annuities could be underwritten and sold by banks. Court determinations also expanded national banks\\' ability to market insurance products. Consequently, banks of all sizes have expanded their involvement in insurance and annuity activities.By 1999, banks and bank holding companies had gained significant additional product authority in securities and insurance, areas that had been perceived to be on the other side of the banking and commerce wall at the time Corrigan wrote his essay. A number of factors persuaded Congress that federal action was appropriate, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was passed. Congress had learned from the securities and insurance experiences of foreign banks, both the high points and the low points. On the one hand, institutions in some European countries had successfully broadened their securities and insurance activities. On the other hand, there were lingering questions about whether some Pacific rim banks were too closely linked to certain commercial enterprises in the region, thus facilitating the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. However, the U.S. banking industry had also developed improved ways to manage risk, and banking supervision had become more effective. In addition, the improved analytical capacity offered by new technology, better coordination among domestic and international bank supervisors, a healthy track record for U.S. banks, and the growth of consolidated home-country supervision across the world helped U.S. banks and their affiliates to further expand their commercial activities.The response of Congress was essentially threefold. First, it moved the separation wall between banking and commerce to reflect what had already occurred in the marketplace: Gramm-Leach-Bliley also addressed the broader question of what types of businesses could own or affiliate with banks by allowing companies to own banking, securities, and insurance entities within a structure known as a financial holding company. Second, Congress provided a way for banks to gain new-product authority when the new products were determined to be financial in nature, incidental to banking, or complimentary to existing banking authority. Third, by clearly separating the federally insured entity--either banks or thrifts--from the newer and potentially higher-risk new-product authorities, Gramm-Leach-Bliley reaffirmed as a matter of public policy that banks continue to be regarded as special. But the act offers a clear acknowledgment that the separation of banking and commerce is not a bright line but is instead a negotiated compromise--one that will continue to move as markets change and products are refined. The guiding consideration in this compromise will be the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund.Are Banks Still Special?Much has changed in the banking landscape since Corrigan wrote his essay twenty-four years ago. Significant increases in international capital flows among bank and nonbank entities, in addition to a broad range of specialized financial instruments mean banks can no longer be considered the only source of transaction accounts. Except for their access to the Federal Reserve discount window, banks are no longer the dominant provider of liquidity for other financial industries. But banks remain the key access point to the dominant wholesale payments network, and they still provide federally insured checking and savings deposits. With the rise of new financial services, products, and techniques, moreover, banks have expanded their role in providing liquidity in more indirect ways, for example, through securitization of loans and backup commitments to securitization vehicles and other capital-markets instruments. Even when banks may not be \"special\" or unique providers in a particular market, banks have proven themselves to be formidable competitors and innovators--which only reinforces banks\\' importance in the proper functioning of our financial system. In short, the public\\'s trust and confidence in banking continue to be vital to our financial well-being.Banks provided considerable credit in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when financial flows were slowed by operational problems. To be sure, banks were able to provide this credit in part because of the huge injection of liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve. But that is a key role for banks in a crisis: to obtain funds--through the discount window or from open market operations, if necessary--and to channel them to those needing funds, based on an assessment of their creditworthiness. Banks\\' access to the discount window and the payments system, as well as their ongoing relationships with customers and their credit-evaluation skills, allow them to play this role. During a crisis, those banks that play critical roles in the payments system are especially important. As a result, these banks are expected to be very resilient. Though banks now have a smaller role in transmitting monetary policy, they still help to transmit policy actions by arbitraging between the federal funds market and other money markets.ConclusionA strong case can be made that banks continue to be special. And because they are special, we, as regulators, will continue to apply high standards to companies seeking a bank charter. We must also continue to examine and supervise banks for safety and soundness. Likewise, it appears that Congress will take a cautious approach when determining what types of companies may own and affiliate with banks.But banks must also compete in the marketplace. Consequently, we can expect over time to see adjustments in both the direct activities of banks and in the line separating banking and commerce. History is, in some sense, about the drawing, re-evaluation, and re-drawing of lines. As a matter of public policy, changes will trail rather than lead the marketplace, and any changes must be informed by a careful study of both the role we want banks to play in our economy and the needs of the marketplace. I am honored to participate in this tribute to Otmar Issing. I have known and admired Otmar for some time. It has been a source of great pride that he has considered me a worthy intellectual sparing partner over the years. From the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the restaurants of Frankfurt and at many conferences in between, we have challenged each other to state our assumptions, examine the evidence, and adjust our conclusions accordingly. I have derived enormous benefit from that give-and-take--a sentiment, I am sure, that many others in this room share.I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late--namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy. Otmar and I have debated this issue on many occasions, and these discussions--together with recent research carried out at the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and elsewhere--have been both challenging and stimulating. The preparation of this talk has afforded me a welcome opportunity to reexamine my thinking on this subject. So, today, I will review the arguments and the evidence as I see them and draw out the conclusions to which I am currently led.Two Strategies for Dealing with Market BubblesMost fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation. But many argue that pronounced booms and busts in asset markets are another matter, especially if actual valuations appear to be misaligned with fundamentals. What should a central bank do when it suspects it faces a major speculative event--one that might be large enough to threaten economic stability when it unwinds? To help frame the discussion, I will focus on two different strategies that have been proposed for dealing with market bubbles.The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy--calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years. Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term. Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process. Following this strategy does not imply that policymakers ignore the expected future evolution of speculative activity. If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations. Practically speaking, however, I view our ability to act on such suspicions as limited given how little we know about the dynamics of speculative episodes.Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices--indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation. It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings.Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble. Thus, the strategy seeks to trade off the near-certainty of worse macroeconomic performance today for the chance of disproportionally better performance in the future, on the theory that the repercussions of a major market correction could be highly nonlinear. But the extra-action proposal is by no means a bold call for central banks to prick market bubbles. As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession. Rather, the extra-action strategy is intended only to provide some limited insurance against the possibility of highly adverse events occurring down the road.Common GroundI will be talking at length about the differences between the two strategies, but I must stress up front how much they have in common. Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework. Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies.At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level. Of course, we may not be prepared to write down a specific loss function and say, \"There, that\\'s what I\\'m minimizing.\" But our deliberative processes and our actions seem broadly consistent with that characterization of the general problem. This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area. Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well.We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is market-determined and easily liquified. Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending. Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services. Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending. In cases of sharply falling market valuations, these adverse credit-channel effects may even be exacerbated by the deteriorating health of banks and other financial institutions. In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time.Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts. In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass. While no one uses formal Bayesian methods to solve this difficult problem, I think most policymakers do engage in at least an informal weighing of the various possibilities and their implications when setting policy.Three Conditions for Extra Action to Lead to Better OutcomesNow let me turn from areas of agreement to more contentious issues, ones that have a strong bearing on the relative merits of the two strategies. As the ECB article notes, extra action is often seen as a type of insurance. And as with any insurance policy, before you buy you have to ask whether the expected benefits outweigh the costs. As I see it, extra action pays only if three tough conditions are met. First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, there must be a fairly high probability that a modestly tighter policy will help to check the further expansion of speculative activity. And finally, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from a less expansive bubble must be sizable. You may be thinking that, in stating the three conditions, I have slanted the case with such phrases as \"reasonable confidence\" and \"fairly high probability.\" But stick with me, and I hope to persuade you that these probabilistic qualifiers are needed to judge the merits of extra action.For the moment, let me set aside the first condition and assume that central banks can distinguish an emerging bubble from improving fundamentals at an early stage. What about the other two conditions? Should we presume that a limited application of restrictive policy would materially restrain the speculative boom and make its eventual unwinding less disruptive for the overall economy?Consider the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-to-late 1990s. The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices. How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future. In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals. But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies. At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects.However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble. Even then, with the second condition now met, the third condition might not hold: The expected improvement in future macroeconomic performance from moderating the bubble\\'s expansion may not be enough to more than offset the up-front costs of extra action. To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future.Admittedly, if the worst-outcome scenario associated with an unchecked bubble is judged sufficiently dire and if the scenario is not seen as too improbable, then a risk-averse policymaker might regard the expected return from extra action insurance as worth its upfront cost. However, our confidence in such an assessment would seem to hinge on believing that the effects of market corrections could be markedly nonlinear. Proponents of extra action often cite an increased risk of severe financial distress as a potential source of such effects. However, without the onset of deflation, how large is this risk? In recent history, the health of the U.S. financial system remained solid after the collapse of the high-tech boom, despite the bankruptcy of dozens of telecom and dot-com firms, the loss of more than $8 trillion in stock market wealth, and stress in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Moreover, the financial sectors of most other developed economies also weathered the worldwide drop in corporate equity values fairly well.Of course, the nonlinear risks associated with a collapsing bubble may depend on the initial health of the financial system, and under some circumstances we could be worried about the potential for significant financial distress to accompany the bursting of a bubble, should that bubble expand further. Even in such cases, however, I wonder whether good prudential supervision in advance and prompt action to clean up any lingering structural problems afterward would not be better ways to deal with this possibility. Certainly, closer oversight of banking systems during the 1980s, including the United States, would have left many economies in a stronger position during the early 1990s. This lesson has been absorbed by supervisory authorities around the world, as evidenced by our successful efforts to strengthen bank capital and our financial systems.Proponents of extra action often argue that it should reduce the risk of hitting the zero bound, but we should recognize that under some circumstances extra action may actually exacerbate the problem. To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts. Now the central bank contemplates taking extra action. In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small. In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand. With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts. Under these conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expected economic performance, not improve it.Another purported benefit of extra action is that, by raising the cost of capital to firms and households, it helps reduce overinvestment fostered during speculative booms, thereby making it easier for the economy to recover after the bubble collapses. However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the macroeconomic importance of such capital mis-allocation. True, the U.S. high-tech boom led to overinvestment in some sectors, wasting resources and creating lingering difficulties while capital overhangs were eliminated. But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years.Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals. Thus, mitigating capital misallocation in one sector would have created capital misallocations elsewhere, making the assessment of the net gain from extra action difficult. And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation.Now I would like to return to the first condition, the one I sidestepped a few minutes ago--the question of identifying market bubbles in a timely fashion. The ECB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate. For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain.Under extra action, mistakenly identifying a bubble has significant costs. By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose. Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses. But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time. And the mistaken call would have reduced welfare by needlessly inducing fluctuations in the macroeconomy.Timing is also an issue. Let us suppose that the evidence is so compelling that policymakers become fairly confident that valuations are excessively rich. Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability. The market correction could occur with policy in a tighter position but before extra action had enough time to materially influence speculative activity.Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits. Such talk might do some good by prompting investors to stop and rethink their assumptions. And talk by itself should not do much lasting harm even if valuations turn out to be justified--provided, however, that words are not seen as precursors to action under circumstances in which conventional policy would still be the best approach.To wrap up this critique, I summarize as follows: If we can identify bubbles quickly and accurately, are reasonably confident that tighter policy would materially check their expansion, and believe that severe market corrections have significant non-linear adverse effects on the economy, then extra action may well be merited. But if even one of these tough conditions is not met, then extra action would be more likely to lead to worse macroeconomic performance over time than that achievable with conventional policies that deal expeditiously with the effects of the unwinding of the bubbles when they occur. For my part, I am dubious that any central banker knows enough about the economy to overcome these hurdles. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances, or perhaps at some point in the future when our understanding of asset markets and the economy has increased, such a course of action would be appropriate.Asymmetries and Moral HazardProponents of extra action have their own bones to pick with the conventional strategy, especially as it relates to the alleged asymmetric nature of the policy\\'s response to asset market booms and busts. In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC\\'s actions over the past twenty years, the Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems.Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk. Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a \"Greenspan put,\" stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy. Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were. The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions. Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves.Ironically, one can argue that extra action may pose a more significant risk of moral hazard. It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some \"appropriate\" level. How does this strategy play out if a central bank takes extra action and speculative activity continues unabated or even intensifies? Do policymakers raise rates even further above levels consistent with conventional policy and, if so, at what consequences for the economy? And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices? If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase?ConclusionMy remarks today have been intended as a salute to Otmar and to all the valuable contributions he has made over the years to my thinking and to that of policymakers around the world. Otmar, you have taught me much about intellectual rigor in support of central bank contributions to economic welfare--and about friendship. Weighing the relative merits of extra action and conventional policy is not easy and requires a nuanced interpretation of the arguments and the evidence, as well as some hard thinking. Otmar and his colleagues have done this in advancing the case for extra action, and by so doing they have given me a good intellectual workout--and Otmar, I thank you for that. I hope my response has provided a good workout in return. I look forward to continuing the debate and especially the friendship for many years to come.Footnotes I would like to thank the Economic Club of New York for inviting me to speak here this evening. I intend to take the opportunity afforded by an audience of experts on global financial markets to address an intriguing financial phenomenon: the fact that, over the past seven quarters or so, tightening monetary policy has been accompanied by long-term yields that have moved only a little on net. Why have long-term interest rates not risen more, as they have done over previous policy tightening cycles? And what implications does this pattern of long-term interest rates have for monetary policy and the economic outlook? As you will see, in my remarks I will do a better job of raising questions than of answering them. In particular, I will conclude that the implications for monetary policy of the recent behavior of long-term yields are not at all clear-cut. I hope you will agree that these questions are nevertheless worthwhile posing, as they are intertwined with a number of important economic and financial issues. I should say at the outset that the views I will express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).The Federal Reserve\\'s Tightening CycleThe tightening cycle that began at the end of June 2004 is notable in at least four respects. First, its onset was delayed for longer than many observers expected. The FOMC kept policy unusually accommodative for an extended, or should I say for a considerable, period. The goal, as you know, was to help ensure that the economic expansion would be self-sustaining and to protect against a remote risk that the fall in inflation observed during 2003 might culminate in outright deflation--an outcome that could have had potentially serious consequences for the economy and for the efficacy of monetary policy. Indeed, with those concerns in mind, in 2003 the Federal Reserve made explicit for the first time that price stability is a symmetric objective: It is important to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high.A second way in which the most recent experience has been unusual is the extent to which policy actions have been signaled in advance. Both in the months leading up to the initiation of the tightening cycle and during the cycle itself, the statements issued after each meeting of the FOMC provided qualitative guidance about the likely future path of policy and its dependence on economic events. Providing information about the expected path of policy helped to ensure that long-term interest rates and other asset prices did not build in a projected pace of tightening that was more rapid than the Committee itself anticipated, and the statement\\'s focus on the conditionality of future policy actions emphasized the ongoing need for both policymakers and financial market participants to respond to economic news. In retrospect, the clear communication of policy provided notable benefits, in my view, by increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy while minimizing unnecessary volatility in financial markets.A fourth interesting aspect of the latest tightening cycle, which is my principal focus this evening, is the behavior of long-term interest rates. Since June 30, 2004, the overnight interest rate has moved up 3-1/2 percentage points, but the ten-year nominal Treasury yield has only edged higher. At less than 4-3/4 percent, that yield is not much above the target federal funds rate of 4-1/2 percent and, indeed, is about even with yields for maturities of one to three years. In the remainder of my remarks I will speculate on the reasons for and consequences of this historically unusual behavior of long-term rates.The Recent Behavior of Longer-Term YieldsSome discussion of the arithmetic of longer-term yields provides a useful perspective on recent developments in bond markets. The ten-year Treasury yield, for example, can be viewed as a weighted average of the current one-year rate and nine one-year forward rates, with the weights depending on the coupon yield of the security. As I will discuss, each of these forward rates can be split further into (1) a portion equal to the one-year spot rate that market participants currently expect to prevail at the corresponding date in the future, and (2) a portion that reflects additional compensation to the bondholder for the risk of holding longer-dated instruments.Current and near-term forward rates are particularly sensitive to monetary policy actions, which directly affect spot short-term interest rates and strongly influence market expectations of where spot rates are likely to stand in the next year or two. Indeed, as we would expect, the recent tightening of policy has been accompanied by increases in both the current one-year rate and next few years\\' forward rates. For example, since June 2004, the one-year forward rate for the period two to three years in the future has risen almost 1-1/2 percentage points. As the ten-year yield is about unchanged even as its near-term components have risen appreciably, it follows as a matter of arithmetic that its components representing returns that are more distant in time must have fallen. In fact, the one-year forward rate nine years ahead has declined 1-1/2 percentage points over this tightening cycle. Incidentally, by comparing forward rates implied by yields on nominal Treasuries with those implied by Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation, we can infer that about two-thirds of the overall decline in far-distant nominal forward rates over this tightening cycle has been associated with a drop in real yields, with the remainder reflecting a drop in inflation compensation.It is important to note that the marked decline in far-forward interest rates has not been confined to U.S. Treasury securities. The spread in yields between Treasuries and longer-term private securities such as corporate bonds is little changed or is down on net since June 2004, implying that essentially all of the fall in forward rates seen in the Treasury market has occurred in private yields as well. These patterns have also appeared in securities not denominated in dollars. For example, over the same period, longer-term government and swap yields in the United Kingdom and the euro area have moved appreciably lower. Indeed, long-term nominal yields have dropped in a number of countries, often by more than in the United States, and the yield curves in many of these countries are also rather flat or even slightly inverted.Some Reasons for the Decline in Far-Forward Rates Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years? Observers have offered two broad (and not mutually exclusive) classes of explanations. One set of explanations holds that bond yields are reacting to current or prospective macroeconomic conditions. Another set focuses on special factors that may have influenced market demands for long-term securities per se, independent of the economic outlook. I will first consider explanations that emphasize possible changes in the net demand for long-term securities and later return to explanations that focus on the link between bond yields and the economic outlook.As I have noted, each of the forward interest rates implicit in the term structure can be usefully decomposed into two parts: (1) the spot interest rate that market participants currently expect to prevail at the corresponding date in the future and (2) the additional compensation that investors require for the risk of holding longer-term instruments, known as the term premium. With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium. In particular, if the demand for long-dated securities rises relative to the supply, then investors will generally accept less compensation to hold longer-term instruments--that is, the term premium will decline.To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates. In modern models of the term structure, yields at each horizon are explained by a small number of factors. In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations. These factors, in turn, can be used to estimate term premiums at each point in time, although one should clearly acknowledge that the results can be sensitive to various statistical and modeling assumptions.However, these observations speak more to the existence of a short-term impact of large purchases and sales--the result of limits to liquidity in the very short run--than to the perhaps more important question of whether those transactions have a lasting effect on yields. On this latter issue, clear evidence is harder to come by. Several pieces of indirect evidence suggest that the long-term effect of foreign purchases on yields may be moderate. Notably, the global market for dollar-denominated bonds is enormous--perhaps around $25 trillion, including dollar-denominated debt issued by other countries as well as debt issued abroad by U.S. residents. In the long run, therefore, the market should be able to absorb purchases and sales of large absolute magnitude with relatively modest changes in yields. Indeed, long-term yields continued to fall over recent quarters even as foreign official holdings of Treasury securities increased at a slower pace than previously.The performance of Treasuries relative to that of other fixed-income instruments also argues against a dominant influence of foreign official portfolio decisions on long-term rates. If foreign official holdings of Treasuries were the source of the decline in their yields, then we would expect to observe increased spreads between yields on Treasury securities and the returns to other types of debt less favored by foreign official holders. But we have not seen a significant widening of private yield spreads relative to Treasuries--quite the contrary--and, as I noted earlier, yields in other industrial economies have fallen as well, in many cases by more than U.S. yields. A reasonable conclusion is that the accumulation of dollar reserves abroad has influenced U.S. yields, but reserve accumulation abroad is not the only, or even the dominant, explanation for their recent behavior.Changes in the management of and accounting for pension funds are a third possible source of a declining term premium. Reforms proposed in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are widely expected to encourage pension funds to be more fully funded and to take steps to better match the duration of their assets and liabilities. Together with the increased need of aging populations in the industrial countries to prepare for retirement, these changes may have increased the demand for longer-maturity securities. We have seen little direct evidence to date of sizable pension-fund portfolio shifts toward long-duration bonds, at least in the United States. But judging from anecdotal reports, bond investors might be attaching significant odds to scenarios in which pension funds tilt the composition of their portfolios toward such assets substantially over time.Fourth and finally, as investors\\' demands for long-duration securities may have increased over the past few years, the supply of such securities seems not to have kept pace. The average maturity of outstanding Treasury debt, for example, has dropped by 1‑1/2 years since its peak in 2001, a trend just now beginning to turn with the Treasury\\'s reissuance of the thirty-year bond. Corporations and households, however, have taken advantage of low long-term rates to lengthen the duration of their debt in recent years, which has compensated to some extent for the reduced duration of available Treasury debt.Long-Term Yields and Monetary PolicyWhat does the historically unusual behavior of long-term yields imply for the conduct of monetary policy? The answer, it turns out, depends critically on the source of that behavior. To the extent that the decline in forward rates can be traced to a decline in the term premium, perhaps for one or more of the reasons I have just suggested, the effect is financially stimulative and argues for greater monetary policy restraint, all else being equal. Specifically, if spending depends on long-term interest rates, special factors that lower the spread between short-term and long-term rates will stimulate aggregate demand. Thus, when the term premium declines, a higher short-term rate is required to obtain the long-term rate and the overall mix of financial conditions consistent with maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.However, if the behavior of long-term yields reflects current or prospective economic conditions, the implications for policy may be quite different--indeed, quite the opposite. The simplest case in point is when low or falling long-term yields reflect investor expectations of future economic weakness. Suppose, for example, that investors expect economic activity to slow at some point in the future. If investors expect that weakness to require policy easing in the medium term, they will mark down their projected path of future spot interest rates, lowering far-forward rates and causing the yield curve to flatten or even to invert. Indeed, historically, the slope of the yield curve has tended to decline significantly in advance of recessions.An alternative perspective holds that the recent behavior of interest rates does not presage an economic slowdown but suggests instead that the level of real interest rates consistent with full employment in the long run--the natural interest rate, if you will--has declined. For example, some observers have pointed to factors that may create a longer-term drag on the growth in household spending, including high energy costs, the likelihood of slower growth in house prices, and a possible reversal of recent declines in saving rates. If these drags on the growth of spending do materialize, then a lower real interest rate will be needed to sustain aggregate demand and keep the economy near full employment. To be consistent with a lower long-term real rate, the short-term policy rate might have to be lower than it would otherwise be as well.ConclusionWhat conclusion should we draw? Clearly, bond prices, like other asset prices, incorporate a great deal of information that is potentially very relevant to policymakers. However, the information is not always easy to extract and--as in the current situation--the bottom line for policy appears ambiguous. In particular, to the extent that the recent behavior of long-term rates reflects a declining term premium, the policy rate associated with a given degree of financial stimulus will be higher than usual. But to the extent that long-term rates have been influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including such factors as trends in global saving and investment, the required policy rate will be lower. Given this reality, policymakers are well advised to follow two principles familiar to navigators throughout the ages: First, determine your position frequently. Second, use as many guides or landmarks as are available.In the context of monetary policy, these principles suggest that policymakers should monitor bond yields carefully in judging the current state of the economy--but only in tandem with the signals from other important financial variables; direct readings on spending, production, and prices; and a goodly helping of qualitative information. Ultimately, a robust approach to policymaking requires the use of multiple sources of information and multiple methods of analysis, combined with frequent reality checks. By not tying policy to a small set of forecast indicators, we may sacrifice some degree of simplicity, but we are less likely to be misled when a favored variable behaves in an unusual manner.Footnotes I would like to thank the sponsors of OpRisk USA for providing an opportunity for bankers, regulators, consultants, and other interested parties to share their perspectives on operational-risk management.Today, I will speak about the importance of risk management and its relationship to capital. I will also touch on the broad objectives of effective operational-risk management and offer specific observations on some of the challenges of operational-risk quantification. In addition, I will describe the current status of the Basel II process.Importance of Risk ManagementOver the past several decades, we have witnessed substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry, particularly at our largest institutions. These very large entities have broad geographic reach, operate in many lines of business, and offer a wide array of complex products and services. The largest institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet and have adopted strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. The risk-management techniques employed by banking organizations continue to improve and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape.The Federal Reserve, in its role as both a bank supervisor and the nation\\'s central bank, has an obvious interest in maintaining the stability of the banking industry and the financial system as a whole. We, along with our counterparts at the other U.S. bank and thrift regulatory agencies, are responsible for ensuring that banking institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and have strong capital levels. But with the advent of very large banking organizations that engage in a wide variety of business activities--some of them quite complex--the Federal Reserve has become even more interested in ensuring that banking organizations understand the risks of these activities.For their part, bankers continue to improve the risk-management and risk-measurement processes at their institutions, and regulators have supported these efforts. Banks themselves have created many of the new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures in order to be more effective competitors and to control and manage their losses. By more clearly defining risk exposures and identifying the causes of and controls for their losses, bank management can more effectively integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decisionmaking. Banks that integrate risk measurement into their business-line goals often find that this effort helps them to implement their strategic plans more effectively. Ideally, an institution should use a systematic approach to identify and measure its risk exposures; however, even the best processes for evaluating and measuring risk suffer if flawed data are used. To conduct a credible internal analysis of relevant risks, institutions should identify which risks can generally be quantified and which ones cannot. When risk measurements are based on scarce or incomplete data, or on unproven quantitative tools, institutions might need to use sensitivity analyses, stress tests, or scenario analyses to a greater extent in order to develop meaningful risk measures.Banks that wish to remain competitive must keep up with the latest developments in risk measurement and management. Bankers must ensure that their models keep up with current practice and continue to capture risks accurately, especially as new activities and new products are introduced. Similarly, the supervisory community needs to keep up with developments in banking and finance. We consider this vitally important because banking is and will remain a highly dynamic industry. Supervisors will have to pay attention to evolving sound practices and ensure that new regulations do not unduly inhibit banks from adopting new banking practices and financial instruments. Our focus on balancing developments in the industry with safe and sound operations at institutions is increasingly important, given the growing complexity, sophistication, and concentration of today\\'s banking system. And with the advent of Basel II, which is intended to update capital rules for large, internationally active U.S. banking organizations, supervisors must become even more involved in understanding emerging sound practices in risk measurement and management.One of the most important sound practices for a banking organization is the tying of risk exposures to capital. Banks that use similar risk models can have very different risk exposures. That is why the Basel II approach to capital is so important. Basel II provides a framework in which the risk level banks choose to accept is reflected in their capital. Banks with higher loss exposures will be required to hold more capital than those who have lower risk appetites. This provides a strong relationship with risk management, in that returns earned in riskier business lines will necessarily be higher to cover the cost of the additional capital held.Operational-Risk ManagementFocusing now on operational risk, one of the most substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry in recent years is the movement of the largest organizations toward fee-based revenue streams. These new activities include securitizing loan portfolios, with the bank retaining responsibility for loan servicing; buying and selling financial instruments for customers; and other business lines that generate revenue by charging customers transaction and account processing fees. These activities generate little balance-sheet exposure, but they present the potential for large losses if the complex systems and financial deals associated with them are not managed in a sound manner.Operational risks are also becoming more important in the large, complex financial institution as more technology and automated processes are used in all areas of operations. When banks used manual processes, errors were confined to the limited area where the employee worked. But in a modern technology setting, factors such as breakdowns in controls, errors in software code, and processing stream interruptions can have enterprisewide effects on the performance of the organization.Recent history provides us with ample evidence that operational risk can be significant. Large financial institutions have reported operational losses from breakdowns in operating controls that, in some cases, have exceeded their credit- or market-related losses. In the area of legal risk, for example, many institutions have learned that failing to identify and promptly correct problems can result in losses that significantly exceed management\\'s initial expectations. Over the past decade, large financial institutions have experienced more than 100 operational loss events in excess of $100 million each; some of these individual operational losses, resulting from fraud, rogue trading, and settlements stemming from questionable business practices, have exceeded $1 billion.An effective operational-risk management framework, therefore, is essential for identifying and managing operational risks. As you know, analysts at the main rating agencies are placing increasing importance on operational risk when they assess a bank\\'s credit ratings. We believe effective operational-risk management has both quantitative and qualitative components and that reliance on solely quantitative or solely qualitative approaches is no longer appropriate. What remains critically important is how these approaches are combined in the implementation of an effective process for identifying, measuring, managing, and controlling operational risk throughout an organization.Effective operational-risk measurement tools enable the executive management at the largest banking organizations to make better risk-and-return decisions, thereby enhancing the return on their institution\\'s capital investments. By considering operational risk as part of their assessment of capital requirements and true profitability, corporate decisionmakers can better decide which business lines to invest in or shut down. The organization further benefits when operational-risk measurement is integrated with the management processes of individual business units, because this helps communicate risk-management issues to the business lines. The allocation of operational-risk capital to these units provides them with a financial incentive to reduce the chance of operational losses. Hard numbers, linked to specific risks, also allow business lines to more accurately price their products.Some banking organizations are already benefiting by factoring operational-risk measurement and management into pricing decisions, strategic planning processes, portfolio management activities, management reporting metrics, and decisions regarding incentive compensation. There are potential longer-term benefits as well, including: a reduction in operational losses as control weaknesses are identified and improved; fewer errors and breaks in customer service, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and retention; stronger information security and customer data privacy; higher credit ratings, and increased operational efficiency.One objective of Basel II is to enhance practices at our largest and most complex banking organizations for identifying operational risk exposures and ensuring that these exposures are appropriately supported by regulatory capital. Importantly, the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk under Basel II allows banks to use a framework that relies on their own qualifying methodologies for identifying operational-loss events and measuring risk exposure in order to determine their operational-risk regulatory capital requirements. In this way, the AMA gives banks the flexibility to continue developing and incorporating evolving sound practices for operational-risk measurement and management into their AMA frameworks.Challenges to Operational-Risk Quantification under Basel IIIn the context of Basel II, it has often been argued that measuring operational risk is much more difficult than measuring market or credit risk; however, any model intended to capture unexpected loss has its challenges. For example, market-risk models can be violated when the price of financial products moves in a way that is outside of the historical norm. Credit-risk models need to consider downturn estimates for loss given default, which can depend on the severity of the economic downturn and the price of collateral. Similarly, operational-risk models need to address potential losses that may not have occurred during the short period that most institutions have been collecting internal operational-loss data. This absence of a robust time series of internal operational-loss data is one factor that makes operational-risk modeling particularly challenging.To address the difficulties presented by the very nature of operational risk, the designers of operational-risk measurement frameworks have had to be innovative. For example, we have seen frameworks that use scenario analyses, risk self-assessments, and the judgment of senior business managers in innovative ways. We have also seen creativity in the melding of internal and external loss data to guide thinking about internal loss exposures. Perhaps most significantly, we have seen some truly innovative thinking about ways to integrate operational-risk measurement into the broader framework of operational-risk management.I would like to offer some specific observations on a couple of key challenges relating to operational-risk quantification. First, with respect to operational-loss data, Basel II banks face the challenge of establishing credible operational-loss databases that they can use in determining their regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. The advanced approaches under Basel II create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Banks using an AMA for operational risk will be required to adopt more-formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. For example, Basel II establishes standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends on credible data--and not just for Basel II. Data are needed for all models and risk measures used in financial services, including credit-scoring models, market-based measures such as KMV, and value-at-risk and other economic capital models. The emphasis in Basel II on improved data standards, therefore, should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise.As I mentioned earlier, regulators view capital from the perspective of ensuring safety and soundness in the financial system. But individual financial institutions generally focus on capital, in particular economic capital, as a means for evaluating the profitability of their activities, defining their risk appetite, and setting risk limits. Although the goals differ, there are important linkages between firms\\' efforts to quantify operational-risk capital for regulatory capital purposes and for strategic decisionmaking. To the extent the operational-loss data considered in banks\\' internal economic capital models appropriately reflect the banks\\' risk exposures, banks should be able to leverage their economic capital data collection efforts to measure their operational-risk exposure under an AMA. This leverage is also consistent with the Basel II objective of better aligning regulatory capital with banks\\' internal economic capital.The second challenge I wanted to touch on is banks\\' integration of insurance in their processes for quantifying operational risk. As many of you are aware, Basel II contains a provision whereby banks using an advanced measurement approach for operational risk could adjust their calculated operational-risk exposure to reflect reductions due to operational-risk mitigants, such as insurance, subject to certain limitations.According to the Basel II framework, a bank\\'s risk-mitigation calculations must reflect the bank\\'s insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the bank\\'s overall determination of its operational-risk capital. To the extent banks want to reduce their operational-risk capital charge through the use of insurance, banks must analyze and demonstrate the relationship between specific losses and the ability to collect from the insurer. At the time of the Loss Data Collection Exercise, banks that incorporated insurance benefits into their operational risk capital calculations appeared to do so through an ex-post adjustment to their capital figure in the aggregate, rather than by embedding the specific effects of insurance into the AMA modeling process itself. We expect operational risk managers to work closely with their insurance managers to make better decisions about insurance coverage. This should include clear communication of the nature of individual loss exposures and consideration of the availability of insurance coverage for particular risks.While work remains for those banks that are building their AMA frameworks, we have seen, and continue to see, significant progress in these AMA development efforts. One indication of this progress can be seen in the results of the Loss Data Collection Exercise. This exercise resulted in the submission of over one million internal operational-loss event observations by participating institutions. As you know, internal loss-event data are a key input for determining an institution\\'s regulatory capital requirement for operational risk. These data have provided the agencies with invaluable insights about the comprehensiveness of data at individual institutions. The agencies have provided feedback to participating institutions that should help them in their continuing AMA development efforts. In addition, the agencies continue to analyze the loss data in an effort to provide the industry with additional insights relating to operational-risk quantification.Proposed Revisions to Regulatory Capital RegimeI have referred to certain parts of the Basel II framework in my remarks so far, mostly relating to operational risk and the AMA. Now I would like to give a brief update on where we stand with implementing Basel II in the United States, as well as with amending the current Basel I regime. First of all, you may have heard that tomorrow the Federal Reserve Board plans to review a draft of the interagency Basel II notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) at a public meeting, meaning that a draft NPR will also be made available to the public at that time. The final NPR is expected to be issued in the Federal Register after all of the U.S. banking agencies complete their review and approval processes, meaning it will then be \"officially\" out for comment.We are pleased that the agencies have reached agreement on the draft NPR, since, as you know, we have spent substantial time and considerable effort on the document. We also recognize the extent to which the industry, Congress, and others have anticipated the release of this document--and the greater detail it contains about Basel II in the United States. Of course, we look forward to hearing feedback on the NPR. Your comments and those from others will contribute importantly to the assessment of Basel II objectives and its implementation, and will help us as we develop the framework further.Reasons for Pursuing Basel III think it is helpful, as we anticipate release of the NPR, to review the reasons we are developing U.S. proposals for Basel II. The current Basel I capital framework, adopted nearly twenty years ago, has served us well but has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks offering ever-more complex and sophisticated products and services. We need a revised capital framework for these banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework.One of the major ways in which Basel II should improve safety and soundness is by more closely linking capital requirements to risk. The current Basel I measures are not very risk sensitive and do not provide meaningful measures to bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace for complex banking organizations. Under Basel I, it is possible for two banks with dramatically different risk profiles to have the same minimum capital requirement, and a bank\\'s capital requirement does not reflect deterioration in asset quality. In addition, the balance-sheet focus of Basel I does not adequately capture risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions and fee-based activity--for example, the operational risk embedded in the services from which many large U.S. institutions generate a good portion of their revenues.In addition to enhancing the meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures, Basel II should make the financial system safer by substantially improving risk management at banks. Basel II builds on the risk-management approaches of well-managed banks and creates incentives for banks to move toward leading risk-measurement and risk-management practices; we have already seen some progress in risk management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of discussions about and preparations for Basel II. The new framework is also much more consistent with the internal capital measures that institutions use to manage their business.Basel II can also provide supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for assessing the linkage of risk and capital over time at our most complex institutions; identifying which institutions have deficiencies; and, ultimately, evaluating systemic risk in the banking system. Therefore, Basel II establishes a more coherent relationship between how supervisors assess regulatory capital and how they supervise the banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent capital levels, given their risk profiles, and to better understand differences across institutions. Compared with the current framework, Basel II is more able to accommodate new products and transaction types and to provide meaningful capital measures for the risks embedded therein.As the central bank and the supervisor of banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital. That is why we support safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to Basel II, and why we will remain vigilant in monitoring the ongoing impact of Basel II. This means that during and after the transition to Basel II, supervisors will rely on ongoing, detailed analyses to continuously evaluate the results of the new framework and ensure prudent levels of capital. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is fundamentally important to the health of our banking system. We believe Basel II will be a strong contributor to our tradition of ensuring that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that provide an appropriate cushion against risk-taking.As we have stated before, we will continue to use existing prudential measures to complement Basel II. For example, the current leverage ratio requirement--a ratio of capital to total assets--will remain unchanged for all banks, whether or not they are subject to the Basel II framework. Also, supervisors will continue to enforce existing prompt-corrective-action-requirements in response to declines in capital. Both the leverage ratio and prompt corrective action are fully consistent with Basel II.Proposed Amendments to Basel IBefore I end my remarks about regulatory capital, I would like to offer some thoughts about ongoing efforts to revise existing regulatory capital rules, known as Basel I. First of all, we expect only one or two dozen banks to move to Basel II in the near term. That is, the vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely and soundly under Basel I, as it is amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework already has been amended more than twenty times in response to changes in the banking industry and a better understanding of the risks in individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules.Concerns have been raised about potential competitive inequities between Basel II banks and Basel I banks. We take these concerns seriously. In an effort to mitigate those concerns, regulators have proposed changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules and remain vigilant about potential competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II rules. We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules will apply. Additionally, we recognize the need to have full transparency about Basel II proposals and proposed Basel I amendments. Accordingly, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the proposed Basel I amendments. The intent is to allow banks and others to review both NPRs before both sets of rules are finalized. In that way, bankers from potential opt-in institutions and from those not planning to move to Basel II can evaluate the potential impact of Basel II in light of the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping time frames. At this point, we are still reviewing the comments received on the ANPR for amendments to Basel I (the comment period ended in mid-January). The agencies are developing their proposals for Basel I amendments, on the basis of comments received, and hope to have a Basel I NPR this summer.ConclusionAs prudent supervisors, we need to ensure that banks have strong capital levels--whether banks operate under our current rules, revisions to our current rules, or Basel II. Our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Our challenge as regulators is to work with the industry in developing an effective capital framework. We envision Basel II as a significant step toward a more risk-sensitive capital framework. We strongly encourage you to comment on all aspects of the Basel II NPR, so that we have a well-informed basis for further development of the Basel II framework. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.  The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 5-3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve\\'s views on regulatory relief. The Board commends the Committee for its continued focus and work on this important issue. In particular, I\\'d like to recognize and thank Senator Crapo and his staff for their ongoing efforts to coordinate the many regulatory relief proposals that have been advanced to date by the federal banking agencies, financial trade associations, and others. \\nThe regulatory requirements imposed on our nation\\'s banking organizations have grown over time. Often the impact of these requirements falls hardest on our nation\\'s community banks, which have fewer resources than larger organizations to meet the challenges posed by new or additional regulations. Although the individual requirements and restrictions imposed by federal law may well have been justified at the time of adoption, changes in the marketplace, technology and, indeed, in the federal banking laws themselves may well have altered the balance of the cost-benefit analysis that should underlie each requirement and restriction. Unnecessary regulatory burdens hinder the ability of large and small banking organizations to meet the needs of their customers, operate profitably, innovate, and compete with other financial services providers. That is why the Board periodically reviews its own regulations and why it is so important for Congress to periodically review the federal banking laws to determine whether there are any provisions that may be streamlined or eliminated without compromising the safety and soundness of banking organizations, consumer protections, or other important objectives that Congress has established for the financial system. \\nThe Board, working with the other banking agencies, has been, and will continue to be, a strong and active supporter of Congress\\' regulatory relief efforts. In 2003, the Board provided this Committee with a number of legislative proposals for inclusion in a regulatory relief bill. Since then, in response to requests from Senator Crapo, the Board has reviewed numerous other regulatory relief proposals included in the Matrix of Financial Services Regulatory Relief Proposals (Matrix) compiled by Senator Crapo\\'s staff that may affect the Federal Reserve or the organizations we supervise. As a result of that process, I am pleased to report that the Board now supports more than 35 legislative proposals. These proposals would meaningfully reduce regulatory burden, improve the supervision of banking organizations, or otherwise enhance the federal banking laws without compromising the fundamental goals of bank regulation and supervision. A complete listing and summary of the proposals supported by the Board is included in the appendix to my testimony. We believe these proposals provide an excellent starting point for any regulatory relief legislation, and we look forward to working with the Committee as you develop and perfect such legislation. \\nIn my remarks, I will highlight the three items that are the Board\\'s highest regulatory relief priorities. These proposals would allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at Reserve Banks, provide the Board greater flexibility in setting reserve requirements, and permit depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits. These proposals may well sound familiar to you and they should. The Board has supported these amendments for many years because we believe each of them would improve the operation of our financial system. I should note that these three amendments form the core of S. 1586, the Interest on Business Checking Act of 2005, which was introduced last year by Senators Hagel, Reed and Snowe. The Board strongly supports passage of S. 1586, either independently or as part of a broader regulatory relief bill. \\nIn addition to these priority items, I will highlight a few other legislative proposals that we believe would provide meaningful regulatory relief to banking organizations as well as some steps that the Board has taken on its own to reduce regulatory burden. Finally, I will discuss several matters related to industrial loan companies (ILCs). This topic has been raised by some regulatory relief proposals, but it has much broader policy implications for the structure and supervision of the banking industry. \\nInterest on Reserves and Reserve Requirement Flexibility (Matrix Nos. 1 and 2)The first two of the Board\\'s priority items relate to reserve requirements, which exist to assist the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy. Federal law currently obliges the Board to establish reserve requirements on certain deposits held at depository institutions and mandates that the Board set the ratio of required reserves on transaction deposits above a certain threshold at between 8 and 14 percent. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on the balances held at Reserve Banks to meet reserve requirements, depositories have an incentive to reduce their required reserve balances to a minimum. To do so, they engage in a variety of reserve avoidance activities, including sweep arrangements that move funds from deposits that are subject to reserve requirements to deposits and money market investments that are not. These sweep programs and similar activities absorb real resources and therefore diminish the efficiency of our banking system. \\nBesides required reserve balances, depository institutions also voluntarily hold two other types of balances in their Reserve Bank accounts--contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances. A depository institution holds contractual clearing balances when it needs a higher level of balances than its required reserve balances in order to pay checks or make wire transfers out of its account at the Federal Reserve without incurring overnight overdrafts. Currently, such clearing balances do not earn explicit interest, but they do earn implicit interest in the form of credits that may be used to pay for Federal Reserve services, such as check clearing. Excess reserve balances are funds held by depository institutions in their accounts at Reserve Banks in excess of their required reserve and contractual clearing balances. Excess reserve balances currently do not earn explicit or implicit interest. \\nThe Board has long supported legislation that would authorize the Federal Reserve to pay depository institutions interest on the balances they hold at Reserve Banks. As we previously have testified, paying interest on required reserve balances would remove a substantial portion of the incentive for depositories to engage in reserve avoidance measures, and the resulting improvements in efficiency should eventually be passed through to bank borrowers and depositors. Having the authority also to pay interest on contractual clearing and excess reserve balances as well as required reserves would enhance the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to efficiently conduct monetary policy. In addition, it would complement another of the Board\\'s proposed amendments, which would give the Board greater flexibility in setting reserve requirements for depository institutions. \\nIn order for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to conduct monetary policy effectively, it is important that a sufficient and predictable demand for balances at the Reserve Banks exist so that the Federal Reserve knows the volume of reserves to supply (or remove) through open market operations to achieve the FOMC\\'s target federal funds rate. Authorizing the Federal Reserve to pay explicit interest on contractual clearing balances could potentially provide a demand for voluntary balances that would be stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented effectively through existing procedures without the need for required reserve balances. In these circumstances, the Board, if authorized, could consider reducing--or even eliminating--reserve requirements, thereby reducing a regulatory burden for all depository institutions, without adversely affecting the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to conduct monetary policy. \\nHaving the authority to pay interest on excess reserves also could help mitigate potential volatility in overnight interest rates. If the Federal Reserve was authorized to pay interest on excess reserves, and did so, the rate paid would act as a minimum for overnight interest rates, because banks generally would not lend to other banks at a lower rate than they could earn by keeping their excess funds at a Reserve Bank. Although the Board sees no need to pay interest on excess reserves in the near future, the ability to do so would be a potentially useful addition to the monetary policy toolkit of the Federal Reserve. \\nInterest on Demand Deposits (Matrix No. 3)Another priority item for the Board would repeal the statutory restrictions that currently prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. Repealing these restrictions would improve the overall efficiency of our financial sector, assist small banks in attracting and retaining business deposits, and allow small businesses to earn direct interest on their checking account balances. As a practical matter, these restrictions currently do not impede the payment of interest on consumer deposits because depository institutions generally are permitted to offer individuals interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, which are checkable transaction accounts similar to demand deposits. \\nTo compete for the liquid assets of businesses, however, banks have been compelled to set up complicated procedures to pay implicit interest on compensating balance accounts and they spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis. Small banks often do not have the resources to develop the sweep or other programs that are needed to compete for the deposits of business customers. Moreover, from the standpoint of the overall economy, the expenses incurred by institutions of all sizes to implement these programs are a waste of resources and would be unnecessary if institutions were permitted to pay interest on demand deposits directly. The costs incurred by banks in operating these programs are passed on to their large and small business customers and many small businesses do not benefit from these programs. \\nFor these reasons, the Board\\'s proposed amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the legal authority to offer demand deposits to pay interest on those deposits. The amendment would eliminate the need for banks to operate, and business customers to pay for, sweep and compensating balance arrangements to pay or earn interest on demand deposits. As I will explain a little later, however, the Board opposes amendments that would separately authorize ILCs that operate outside the supervisory and regulatory framework established for other insured banks to offer, for the first time, transaction accounts to business customers. \\nThe Board believes that, once enacted, the authorization for depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits should become effective promptly. S. 1586 would achieve this goal by requiring that the authority to pay interest on demand deposits become effective no later than 90 days after enactment. The Board, however, does not advocate the provisions of S. 1586 or other bills that would allow banks to offer a reservable money market deposit account (MMDA) from which twenty-four transfers a month could be made to other accounts of the same depositor. These provisions would permit banks to sweep balances from demand deposits into MMDAs each night, pay interest on them, and then sweep them back into demand deposits the next day. This type of twenty-four-transfer MMDA likely would be useful only during the transition period before direct interest payments were allowed. Moreover, as the Board has explained in previous testimonies, this type of account would represent an inefficient, more costly and less readily available alternative to interest-bearing demand deposits. \\nDe Novo Interstate BranchingThe Board also strongly supports an amendment that would remove outdated barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks. Since enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal Act), all fifty states have permitted banks to expand on an interstate basis through the acquisition of an existing bank in their state. Interstate banking is good for consumers and the economy as well as banks. The creation of new branches helps maintain the competitiveness and dynamism of the American banking industry and improve access to banking services in otherwise under-served markets. It results in better banking services for households and small businesses, lower interest rates on loans, and higher interest rates on deposits. Interstate branching also increases convenience for customers who live, work, and operate across state borders. \\nHowever, the Riegle-Neal Act permitted banks to open a branch in a new state without acquiring another bank only if the host state enacted legislation that expressly permits entry by de novo branching (an opt-in requirement). To date, twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of opt-in legislation, while twenty-eight states continue to require interstate entry through the acquisition of an existing bank. \\nThis limitation on de novo branching is an obstacle to interstate entry for all banks and also creates special problems for small banks seeking to operate across state lines. Moreover, it creates an unlevel playing field between banks and federal savings associations, which have long been allowed to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis. \\nThe Board\\'s proposed amendment would remove this last obstacle to full interstate branching for banks and level the playing field between banks and thrifts by allowing banks to establish interstate branches on a de novo basis. The amendment also would remove the parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. While the Board supports expanding the de novo branching authority of banks, the Board continues to believe that Congress should not grant this new branching authority to ILCs unless the corporate owners of these institutions are subject to the same type of consolidated supervision and activities restrictions as the corporate owners of other full-service insured banks. \\nSmall Bank Examination Flexibility (Matrix No. 68)The Board also supports expanding the number of small institutions that may qualify for an extended examination cycle. Federal law currently requires that the appropriate federal banking agency conduct an on-site examination of each insured depository institution at least once every twelve months. The statute, however, permits institutions that have less than $250 million in assets and that meet certain capital, managerial, and other criteria to be examined on an eighteen-month cycle. As the primary federal supervisors for state-chartered banks, the Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may alternate responsibility for conducting these examinations with the appropriate state supervisory authority if the Board or FDIC determines that the state examination carries out the purposes of the statute. \\nThe $250 million asset cutoff for an eighteen-month examination cycle has not been raised since 1994. The Board\\'s proposed amendment would raise this asset cap from $250 million to $500 million. Importantly, this change would not exempt any insured depository institution from routine safety and soundness examinations, and would not lengthen the examination cycle for institutions experiencing financial or managerial difficulties. This change is unanimously supported by the federal banking agencies and potentially would allow approximately an additional 1,200 insured depository institutions to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. The Board believes this change would provide meaningful relief to small, financially strong institutions without compromising safety and soundness. \\nThe Board\\'s supervisory experience, however, indicates that institutions with assets approaching $1 billion tend to have more complex risk profiles and are more likely to operate business lines on a regional or national basis than institutions with assets of less than $500 million. For these reasons, the Board is not comfortable raising the asset threshold for an eighteen-month examination cycle to $1 billion, as items No. 112 and No. 169 in the Matrix would do. The Board also does not support proposals, such as item No. 42 in the Matrix, that would allow a federal banking agency to extend the examination cycle for a potentially indefinite period of time for institutions of any size. Despite advances in off-site monitoring, the Board continues to believe that regular on-site examinations play a critical role in helping bank supervisors detect and correct asset, risk-management, or internal control problems at an institution before these problems result in claims on the deposit insurance funds. If an agency is experiencing shortages in its examination resources, we believe it would be better to address these constraints through the supplementation of the agency\\'s resources, rather than by extending the mandated frequency of safety and soundness examinations. \\nOther Board Legislative Proposals and Actions to Reduce Regulatory BurdenIn addition to these proposals, the Board supports a variety of other regulatory relief amendments included in the Matrix. These amendments, which are discussed more fully in the Appendix, would among other things: \\n\\nRestore the Board\\'s ability to determine that nonbanking activities are \"closely related to banking\" for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) and, thus, permissible for all bank holding companies to conduct directly or through a nonbank subsidiary (Matrix No. 137(a)); \\nStreamline the process for insured banks to acquire savings associations and trust companies in interstate merger transactions (Matrix No. 138); \\nModify the cross-marketing restrictions that apply to the merchant banking and insurance company investments of financial holding companies (Matrix No. 139); \\nEliminate certain reporting requirements imposed on banks and their executive officers and principal shareholders that do not contribute significantly to the monitoring of insider lending or the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions (Matrix No. 4); \\nStreamline the inter-agency consultation process for transactions under the Bank Merger Act (Matrix No. 5); \\nShorten the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers where the Attorney General and the relevant federal banking agency agree the transaction will not have a significant adverse effect on competition (Matrix No. 6); \\nSimplify the restrictions governing dividend payments by national and state member banks in a way that would not adversely affect the safety and soundness of member banks (Matrix No. 31); and \\nFacilitate the flow of information during the supervisory process by clarifying that depository institutions and others do not waive any privilege they may have with respect to information when they provide the information to a federal, state or foreign banking authority as part of the supervisory process (Matrix No. 100). In our discussions with banking organizations about regulatory relief, one topic that frequently comes up is the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). We recognize that provisions of the BSA require considerable effort by the banking industry to obtain, document and provide information to law enforcement. To further promote the uniform application of BSA and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, the federal banking agencies, working with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department, recently issued a joint BSA/AML Examination Manual that is designed to promote the effective and consistent examination of BSA/AML compliance. The Board will continue to work with our fellow banking agencies and FinCEN to address key issues related to BSA/anti-money laundering compliance. With respect to currency transaction reports (CTRs), we support the efforts of the Treasury Department and others to develop ways of reducing the burdens imposed on banks in a manner that would not adversely affect the ability of banks to manage their risk or unintentionally impede the investigative tools available to law enforcement. \\n\\nBefore moving on, I\\'d like to mention some recent changes that the Board itself has made to its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (\"Policy Statement\") and capital guidelines that we believe should provide significant relief to community banking organizations. The Board adopted the Policy Statement in 1980 to help facilitate the transfer of ownership of small, community-based banks. Currently, the Policy Statement applies to bank holding companies that have consolidated assets of less than $150 million and that meet certain qualitative criteria. These qualitative criteria are designed to ensure that a small bank holding company does not qualify for the Policy Statement if it engages in significant activities outside its supervised bank subsidiaries. Small bank holding companies that qualify for, and operate under, the Policy Statement also are subject to several additional restrictions and conditions that are designed to ensure that they do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks. \\nLast week, the Board approved an amendment that increases to $500 million the asset size threshold for determining whether a bank holding company may qualify for the Policy Statement and the related exemption from the Board\\'s capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The Board also has proposed to make conforming revisions to its regulatory reporting framework, which should further lower reporting and compliance costs for small bank holding companies. The Board believes these actions properly balance the goals of facilitating the transfer of ownership of small banks, on the one hand, and ensuring capital adequacy and access to necessary supervisory information on the other hand. The Board, however, does not support amendments, like item No. 116 in the Matrix, that potentially would require the Board to raise the asset size threshold in the Policy Statement to $1 billion. \\nIndustrial Loan CompaniesAs I noted earlier, the Board strongly supports amendments that would allow depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits and allow banks to open de novo branches on an interstate basis. The Board, however, believes that, because the corporate owners of ILCs operate outside the prudential and legislative framework applicable to the corporate owners of other types of insured banks, ILCs should not be authorized to offer transaction accounts to business customers or branch de novo across state lines. Our position on these matters is long-standing and based on the broad policy issues presented by the special exemption in current law for ILCs chartered in certain states. \\nILCs are banks; specifically, they are state-chartered FDIC-insured banks. However, due to a special exemption in the federal BHC Act, any type of company, including a commercial or retail firm, may acquire an ILC in a handful of states--principally Utah, California, and Nevada--and avoid the activity restrictions and consolidated supervisory requirements that apply to bank holding companies. \\nILCs were first established early in the twentieth century to make small loans to industrial workers. When the special exemption for ILCs initially was granted in 1987, ILCs were still mostly small, local institutions that had only limited deposit-taking and lending powers. For example, in 1987, most ILCs had less than $50 million in assets and the largest ILC had assets of less than $400 million. Moreover, in 1987, the relevant states were not actively chartering new ILCs. Utah, for example, had a moratorium on the chartering of new ILCs at the time the exemption was enacted. \\nHowever, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently documented, the ILC exemption has been actively exploited in recent years, resulting in a significant change in the character, powers and ownership of ILCs. For example, one ILC operating under the exception now has more than $60 billion in assets and more than $52 billion in deposits, and an additional nine exempt ILCs each have more than $1 billion in deposits. The aggregate amount of estimated insured deposits held by all ILCs has grown by more than 500 percent since 1999, and the total assets of all ILCs has grown from $3.8 billion in 1987 to $140 billion in 2004. Several large, internationally active commercial companies now own ILCs under this exception and use these banks to support various aspects of their global commercial operations. \\nWhile only a handful of states have the ability to charter exempt ILCs, there is no limit on the number of exempt ILCs these grandfathered states may charter in the future. In addition, due to the limited restrictions that apply under federal law to the ILCs operating under this exemption, an exempt ILC legally may engage in the full range of commercial, mortgage, credit card and consumer lending activities; offer payment-related services, including Fedwire, automated clearing house (ACH) and check clearing services, to affiliated and unaffiliated persons; and accept time and savings deposits, including certificates of deposit (CDs), from any type of customer. \\nWhy does this growth and potential further expansion of ILCs matter? Simply stated, it has the potential to undermine several important policies that Congress has established for the banking system. Let me explain. \\nCongress has established a prudential framework for banking organizations in the United States that is based both on the supervision of insured banks and the supervision of their corporate owners on a group-wide or consolidated basis. Consolidated supervision refers to the legal framework that provides a supervisor the tools it needs--such as reporting, examination, capital and enforcement authority--to understand, monitor and, when appropriate, restrain the risks associated with an organization\\'s consolidated or group-wide activities. Consolidated supervision of the organizations that control banks not only helps prevent bank failures, it also provides important tools for managing and resolving bank failures if and when they do occur. In fact, following the collapse of Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI), which lacked a single supervisor capable of monitoring its diverse and global activities, Congress amended the BHC Act in 1991 to require that foreign banks demonstrate that they are subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis prior to acquiring a bank in the United States. \\nFor a variety of reasons, Congress also has long sought to maintain the general separation of banking and commerce in the United States. This position was reaffirmed by Congress in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 and again in the GLB Act of 1999. In fact, in each of these acts the Congress took affirmative action to close the main loophole then being used by commercial firms to acquire FDIC-insured depository institutions--the so-called \"nonbank bank\" loophole in 1987 and the unitary thrift loophole in 1999. \\nILCs have developed and expanded in recent years outside this framework that governs banking organizations generally. Because of their special exemption in federal law, any type of company may acquire an FDIC-insured ILC that is chartered in certain states without regard to the activity restrictions that Congress has established to maintain the general separation of banking and commerce. The exemption also allows a company to acquire an FDIC-insured bank and avoid the consolidated supervisory framework--including consolidated capital, examination and reporting requirements--that applies to the corporate owners of other full-service insured banks under the BHC Act. In addition, the exemption allows a foreign bank to acquire a U.S. bank engaged in retail banking activities without meeting the requirement under the BHC Act that the foreign bank be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in its home country. \\nAs insured banks, each ILC is supervised by the FDIC as well as by its chartering state. The Board has never questioned either the need for, or the adequacy of, this supervision of an ILC. However, experience has led Congress to determine that supervision of a full-service insured bank is not sufficient, by itself, to protect the taxpayer and the financial system when the bank operates as part of a larger corporate organization. The FDIC does not have the authority to supervise the corporate owners of ILCs and their affiliates in the same manner that bank holding companies and their nonbank affiliates are supervised under the BHC Act. The GAO recently concluded that, due to these differences in authority, exempt ILCs may pose more risk to the deposit insurance funds than banks operating in a bank holding company structure. \\nThe exemption for ILCs in the BHC Act also permits a diversified securities, insurance or financial firm to acquire an FDIC-insured bank without complying with the enhanced capital, managerial and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements established by Congress in the GLB Act for financial holding companies. In addition, although the USA PATRIOT Act requires the Board to consider the effectiveness of a company\\'s policies in combatting money laundering prior to approving the company\\'s application to acquire a bank, this requirement does not apply to companies that seek to acquire an exempt ILC. \\nAffirmatively granting ILCs the ability to offer transaction accounts to business customers or open de novo branches nationwide would significantly expand the powers of exempt ILCs, increase the attractiveness of the current loophole, and eliminate any vestige of a distinction between ILCs and full-service insured banks. This result would be inconsistent with both the historical functions of ILCs and the terms of their special exemption in current law. These proposals individually and collectively also would exacerbate the competitive advantage that the corporate owners of ILCs have over other banking organizations that operate within the supervisory framework established by Congress. \\nThe Board believes that the important principles governing the structure of the nation\\'s banking system--such as the separation of banking and commerce, consolidated supervision, and the supervisory criteria applicable to companies that seek to own or control a bank--should be decided by Congress and, once established, should apply to all organizations that own a bank in a competitively equitable manner. We are concerned that the expansion and exploitation of the ILC exemption is undermining the prudential framework that Congress has carefully crafted and developed for the corporate owners of insured banks. Importantly, these changes also threaten to remove from Congress\\' hands the ability to determine the direction of our nation\\'s financial system with regard to the mixing of banking and commerce. \\nCongress should not permit the nation\\'s policy on these important issues to be decided for it on a de facto basis through the expansion of a loophole that is available to only one type of institution chartered in a handful of states. Rather than expanding the powers of ILCs that operate under this special exemption in a regulatory relief bill, we believe it is important for Congress separately to conduct a thorough review of the special exemption for ILCs and its potential to change the landscape of our financial system and create an unlevel competitive playing field. \\nConclusionI appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Board\\'s legislative suggestions and priorities concerning regulatory relief. The Board looks forward to working with the Committee and your staffs in developing and advancing meaningful regulatory relief legislation that is consistent with the nation\\'s public policy objectives. \\n\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nRegulatory Relief Proposals Supported by theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\n\\nThe Board believes the first 20 items listed below would provide meaningful regulatory relief to banking organizations within the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve. The remaining 16 items would improve the supervision of banking organizations, facilitate the resolution of failed banks, streamline procedural or other requirements under the federal banking laws, or eliminate outdated provisions of law.\\n\\nAuthorize the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held at Reserve Banks (Matrix No. 1) \\n\\nAmendment gives the Federal Reserve explicit authority to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks.\\nGrant the Board additional flexibility in establishing reserve requirements (Matrix No. 2) \\n\\nAmendment provides the Federal Reserve with greater flexibility to set the ratio of reserves that a depository institution must maintain against its transaction accounts below the current ranges established by the Monetary Control Act of 1980.\\nAuthorize depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits (Matrix No. 3) \\n\\nAmendment repeals the provisions in current law that prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. If adopted, the amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the authority to offer demand deposits to pay interest on those deposits.\\nEase restrictions on interstate branching and mergers in a competitively equitable manner (Amendment provided to Committee in July 2003) \\n\\nAmendment affirmatively authorizes national and state banks to open de novo branches on an interstate basis. Currently, banks may establish de novo branches in a new state only if the state has affirmatively authorized de novo branching. This existing limitation places banks at a disadvantage to federal savings associations, which currently have the ability to branch de novo on an interstate basis. The amendment also would remove a parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that may be acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. \\nThe amendment would not allow industrial loan companies (ILCs) that operate under a special exemption in federal law to open de novo branches on a nationwide basis. The corporate owners of these ILCs are not subject to the type of consolidated supervision and activities restrictions that generally apply to the corporate owners of other banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Granting exempt ILCs nationwide branching rights also would be inconsistent with the terms of their special exemption in federal law. \\nSmall Bank Examination Flexibility (Matrix No. 68) \\n\\nAmendment would expand the number of small institutions that may qualify for an eighteen-month (rather than a twelve-month) safety and soundness examination cycle. Under current law, an insured depository institution may qualify for an extended eighteen-month examination cycle only if the institution has less than $250 million in total assets. See 12 U.S.C. § 1820(d). The amendment would raise this asset cap to $500 million, thereby potentially allowing approximately an additional 1,200 institutions to qualify for an extended examination cycle. \\nModification of the cross-marketing restrictions applicable to merchant banking and insurance company investments (Matrix Nos. 139, 171 and 187) \\n\\nAmendment allows the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with portfolio companies that are held under the merchant banking authority in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) to the same extent as such activities are currently permissible for portfolio companies held under the GLB Act\\'s insurance company investment authority. The amendment also would allow the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a portfolio company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the financial holding company does not control the portfolio company.\\nPermit the Board to grant exceptions to the attribution rule concerning shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding company or its shareholders or employees (Matrix No. 140) \\n\\nThe amendment would allow the Board, in appropriate circumstances, to waive the attribution rule in section 2(g)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act). This attribution rule currently provides that, for purposes of the BHC Act, a company is deemed in all circumstances to own or control any shares that are held by a trust (such as an employee benefit plan) for the benefit of the company or its shareholders or employees. The amendment would allow the Board to waive the rule when, for example, the shares in question are held by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by the bank holding company\\'s employees and the facts indicate that the bank holding company does not have the ability to control the shares held by the plan.\\nAllow insured banks to engage in interstate merger transactions with savings associations and trust companies (Matrix No. 138) \\n\\nThe amendment would allow an insured bank to directly acquire, by merger, an insured savings association or uninsured trust company in a different home state without first converting the target savings association or trust company into an insured bank. As under current law, the insured bank would have to be the survivor of the merger.\\na. Restore Board\\'s authority to determine that new activities are \"closely related to banking\" and permissible for all bank holding companies (Matrix No. 137a) \\n\\nAmendment would restore the Board\\'s ability to determine that nonbanking activities are \"closely related to banking\" under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and, thus, permissible for all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies. Bank holding companies would still be required to become a financial holding company to engage in the types of expanded activities authorized by the GLB Act--including full-scope securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking activities--as well as any new activities that the Board determines under the GLB Act are \"financial in nature,\" \"incidental to a financial activity\" or \"complementary to a financial activity.\"b. Allow bank holding companies to engage in insurance agency activities (Alternative to Item 9.a.) (Matrix No. 137b) \\n\\nAlternative amendment would allow all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies, to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Currently, bank holding companies that do not become a financial holding company may engage only in very limited insurance sales activities (primarily involving credit-related insurance). However, most banks are permitted to sell any type of insurance, either directly or through a subsidiary. The amendment would rectify this imbalance by permitting all bank holding companies to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Insurance agency activities involve less risk than insurance underwriting and other principal activities. Bank holding companies would continue to be required to become a financial holding company to underwrite insurance (other than credit-related insurance).\\nShorten the post-approval waiting period for bank mergers and acquisitions where the relevant banking agency and the Attorney General agree the transaction will not have adverse competitive effects (Matrix No. 6) \\n\\nAmendment allows the responsible federal banking agency, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, to reduce the post-approval waiting periods under the Bank Merger Act and BHC Act from fifteen days to as few as five days. The amendment would not alter the time period that a private party has to challenge a banking agency\\'s approval of a transaction for reasons related to the Community Reinvestment Act.\\nRepeal certain reporting requirements imposed on the insiders of insured depository institutions (Matrix No. 4) \\n\\nAmendment repeals the provisions of current law that require: (i) an executive officer of a bank to file a report with the bank\\'s board of directors concerning the officer\\'s indebtedness to other banks; (ii) a member bank to file a separate report each quarter concerning any loans made to its executive officers during the quarter; and (iii) executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank to report to the bank\\'s board of directors any loans received from a correspondent bank. The Board has found that these reporting requirements do not contribute significantly to the monitoring of insider lending. These amendments would not alter the statutory limits or conditions imposed on loans by banks to their insiders.\\nProvide an adjustment for the small depository institutions exception under the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (DIMIA) (Matrix No. 49) \\n\\nCurrently, the DIMIA generally prohibits a management official of one depository institution from serving as a management official of any other non-affiliated depository institution or depository institution holding company if the institutions or an affiliate of such institutions have offices that are located in the same metropolitan statistical area. The statute provides an exception from this restriction for institutions that have less than $20 million in assets, but this dollar figure has not been updated since 1978. The amendment would increase this amount to $100 million.\\nSimplifying dividend calculations for national and state member banks (Matrix No. 31) \\n\\nAmendment would simplify the process for national and state member banks to pay dividends by eliminating the restrictions that currently allow a national bank or state member bank to pay dividends only if the bank\\'s surplus is equal to or greater than its capital account or the bank has transferred at least 10 percent of its recent net income to its surplus fund. The amendment would not alter the other restrictions in current law that ensure that national and state member banks do not pay excessive dividends. For example, national and state member banks would continue to be prohibited from paying any dividend if such action would cause the bank to become undercapitalized.\\nAuthorize member banks to use pass-through reserve accounts (Matrix No. 141) \\n\\nAmendment permits banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System to count as reserves their deposits in other banks that are \"passed through\" by those banks to the Federal Reserve as required reserve balances. Nonmember banks already are able to use such pass-through reserve accounts.\\nProtection of information provided to banking agencies (Matrix No. 100) \\n\\nAmendment allows a depository institution to share information with a federal, state or foreign bank supervisor as part of the supervisory or regulatory process without waiving any privilege the institution may have with respect to the information. The Board strongly supports broadening the amendment to ensure that other persons, including bank holding companies, foreign banks and Edge or agreement corporations, also may provide information to a federal, state or foreign supervisor as part of the supervisory or regulatory process without waiving any privilege they may have with respect to the information.\\nRepeal of CRA Sunshine requirements (Matrix No. 7) \\n\\nThe amendment would repeal the so-called \"CRA Sunshine\" requirements that were adopted as part of the GLB Act in 1999. These provisions require nongovernmental entities or persons and banking organizations that enter into certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to (1) make the agreements available to the public and the appropriate banking agency, and (2) file an annual report with the appropriate banking agency concerning any payments made or received pursuant to the agreement. \\nFlood insurance amendments (Matrix No. 65) \\n\\nThese amendments would:\\n(a) Allow lenders to rely on information from licensed surveyors to determine whether a property is in a flood zone, if the flood map is more than ten years old; \\n(b) Increase the \"small loan\" exception to the flood insurance requirements from $5,000 to $20,000 and adjust this amount periodically based on changes in the Consumer Price Index; \\n(c) Reduce the forty-five-day waiting period required after policy expiration before a lender can \"force place\" flood insurance by fifteen days to coincide with the thirty-day grace period during which flood insurance coverage continues after policy expiration, which would better enable lenders to avoid gaps in coverage on the relevant collateral; and\\n(d) Give the federal banking agencies discretion to impose civil money penalties on institutions found to have engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the flood insurance requirements. \\nPermit credit card banks to make a limited amount of community development loans for CRA purposes (Matrix No. 179) (Support with Minor Modifications) \\n\\nThe amendment would allow a limited-purpose credit card bank--without losing its exemption under the BHC Act--to make and purchase loans that help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income persons and neighborhoods or promote economic development by financing small businesses or farms. The aggregate amount of these non-credit card loans could not exceed 5 percent of the bank\\'s capital and surplus. \\nThe Board supports this amendment subject to a slight modification. The modification is designed to ensure that any non-credit card loans made by a credit card bank under the amendment are made for eligible community development purposes. Because credit card banks are evaluated for CRA purposes under a special community development test, there is no need to allow them to make non-credit card loans for CRA purposes unless those loans would qualify as community development loans under the CRA. \\nPeriodic interagency review of Call Reports (Matrix No. 109) \\n\\nAmendment requires that the federal banking agencies jointly review the Call Report forms at least once every five years to determine if some of the information required by the reports may be eliminated. The federal banking agencies would retain their current authority to determine what information must be included in the Call Reports filed by the institutions under their primary supervision.\\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act (EFT Act) notifications (Matrix No. 115, first bullet) \\n\\nAmendment would increase, from 21 days to 30 days, the amount of advance notice an institution must give to a consumer under the EFT Act before the effective date of any changes in the terms of the consumer\\'s account. The amendment would conform the timing provisions of the EFT Act regarding notices of a change in account terms with the similar provisions in the Truth in Savings Act.\\nTechnical and conforming amendments related to D.C.-chartered banks (Matrix No. 164) \\n\\nThe amendment would make technical and conforming amendments to the federal banking laws to ensure that banks chartered by the District of Columbia are treated as \"state\" banks consistent with the purposes of the 2004 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act.\\nElectronic Records (Matrix No. 161) \\n\\nThis amendment would allow each federal banking agency to preserve the agency\\'s records in electronic or photographic form and determine when such electronic or photographic records may be destroyed. In addition, the amendment would provide that any record maintained electronically or photographically by a federal banking agency in accordance with the agency\\'s regulations shall be considered an original record for all purposes, including submission into evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding.\\nEnsure protection of confidential information received from foreign supervisory authorities (Matrix No. 46) \\n\\nAmendment ensures that a federal banking agency may keep confidential information received from a foreign regulatory or supervisory authority if public disclosure of the information would violate the laws of the foreign country, and the banking agency obtained the information in connection with the administration and enforcement of federal banking laws or under a memorandum of understanding between the authority and the agency. The amendment would not authorize an agency to withhold information from Congress or in response to a court order in an action brought by the United States or the agency.\\nEliminate requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies in Bank Merger Act transactions (Matrix Nos. 5 and 69) \\n\\nAmendment would eliminate the requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies on Bank Merger Act transactions. The reviewing agency would, however, continue to be required to (i) conduct a competitive analysis of the proposed merger, and (ii) request a competitive factors report from the Attorney General and provide a copy of this request to the FDIC (when the FDIC is not the reviewing agency).\\nStreamline Bank Merger Act procedural requirements for transactions involving entities that are already under common control (Matrix No. 61) \\n\\nThe amendment eliminates the need for the reviewing agency for a bank merger involving affiliated entities to request a report on the competitive factors associated with the transaction from the other banking agencies and the Attorney General. The amendment also would eliminate the post-approval waiting period for Bank Merger Act transactions involving affiliated entities. The merger of depository institutions that already are under common control typically does not have any impact on competition.\\nRepeal requirement that the Board approve removal actions brought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (Matrix No. 32) \\n\\nAmendment repeals the requirement that the Board approve removal actions brought by the OCC against institution-affiliated parties of a national bank.\\nClarify and confirm the ability of the banking agencies to enforce conditions imposed in Change in Bank Control (\"CIBC\") Act Notices (Matrix No. 147) \\n\\nAmendment confirms the existing authority of a federal banking agency to enforce a written condition imposed on a depository institution or an institution-affiliated party in connection with a notice filed under the CIBC Act.\\nExpand factors that the banking agencies may consider in evaluating CIBC Act notices (Matrix No. 40 and No. 146) \\n\\nAmendment expands the factors the federal banking agencies may consider in determining whether to disapprove a notice under the CIBC Act to include the financial condition and future prospects of the depository institution involved in the transaction. The amendment also would allow the agencies to extend the time period for processing CIBC Act notice (up to an additional 90 days) if the agency determined that additional time is needed to analyze any plans the notificant may have to make major changes in the business, corporate structure, or management of the institution. \\nEnforcing conditions imposed by another banking agency (Matrix No. 148) \\n\\nAmendment would allow the appropriate federal banking agency for a depository institution, bank holding company or savings and loan holding company to enforce a written condition imposed on the institution or company by another federal banking agency. This would allow, for example, the Board (as the appropriate agency for a state member bank) to enforce a condition imposed on a state member bank by the FDIC in connection with the bank\\'s application for deposit insurance. \\nThe Board supports the amendment subject to a minor modification. The modification is designed to clarify that, regardless of what agency imposes a condition on a depository institution or holding company, only the appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution or holding company has the authority to enforce the condition against the depository institution or holding company. (As under current law, the FDIC would retain its \"back-up\" authority under section 8(t) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) to take action against an insured depository institution if certain conditions are met.) \\nEliminate the special treatment of holding companies that control only ILCs and credit card banks under the cross-guarantee and \"golden parachute\" provisions of the FDI Act (Matrix Nos. 151 and 152) \\n\\nAmendment would modify the cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. § 1815(e)) to cover insured depository institutions whenever they are controlled by the same company and even if the parent company is not a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company. In addition, the amendment would modify the \"golden parachute\" provisions of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) to cover a company that owns an insured depository institution, but that is not a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company. Currently, these provisions do not apply to a company that owns one or more ILCs or credit card banks, but that is not otherwise a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company. \\nWhile the Board supports these limited changes, the Board notes that these amendments would not alter the much more significant exemption for ILCs from the definition of \"bank\" in the BHC Act. The exemption for certain ILCs in the BHC Act permits a company to own an FDIC-insured ILC and avoid the activity restrictions and consolidated supervisory requirements that generally apply to the corporate owners of other insured banks. \\nContractual arrangements with a failed bank (Matrix No. 155) \\n\\nAmendment would prohibit a party, for 90 days after the FDIC is appointed receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution, from exercising any contractual right the party may have to terminate, accelerate or declare a default under a contract with the failed institution, or obtain possession of collateral pledged under such a contract, unless the FDIC consented to the action.\\nBarring convicted felons from participating in the affairs of an uninsured depository institution (Matrix No. 38) \\n\\nAmendment extends to uninsured national banks, state member banks and U.S. branches of a foreign bank the provisions of section 19 of the FDI Act, which automatically prohibits a person that has been convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty, a breach of trust or money laundering from participating in the affairs of an insured depository institutions. The amendment also would allow the OCC or Board, as appropriate, to waive this prohibition as it applies to an uninsured bank or branch, just as the FDIC currently has the authority to waive this prohibition as it applies to insured banks. \\nRestricting the ability of convicted individuals to participate in the affairs of a bank holding company or Edge Act or agreement corporation (Matrix No. 142) \\n\\nAmendment would prohibit a person convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from participating in the affairs of a bank holding company (other than a foreign bank) or an Edge Act or agreement corporation without the consent of the Board. The amendment also would provide the Board with greater discretion to prevent individuals convicted of crimes involving dishonesty or a breach of trust from participating in the affairs of a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company.\\nEnhancing the ability of the banking agencies to suspend or remove bad actors (Matrix No. 43 and No. 150) \\n\\nAmendment revises section 8(g) of the FDI Act, which currently allows the appropriate Federal banking agency to suspend a person from participating in the affairs of a depository institution, bank holding company or savings and loan holding company if the person has been charged with the commission of certain crimes involving dishonesty, a breach of trust or money laundering. The amendment would prohibit a person who has been suspended from service at one depository institution, bank holding company or savings and loan holding company from becoming employed by another depository institution or holding company during the length of the suspension order. In addition, the amendment would clarify that a person may be suspended under section 8(g) even if the person was charged with the relevant crime before becoming affiliated with the depository institution or holding company in question.\\nClarify application of section 8(i) of the FDI Act (Matrix No. 144) \\n\\nAmendment clarifies that a federal banking agency may take enforcement action against a person for conduct that occurred during his or her affiliation with a banking organization regardless of whether the enforcement action is initiated through a notice or an order.\\nElimination of outdated provisions of the BHC Act (Matrix No. 143) \\n\\nAmendment eliminates certain outdated provisions of the BHC Act that no longer have any effect. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Welcome, everyone.  It has been about a year since I’ve been  to one of these meetings, so I’m looking forward to rejoining the conversation.  I want to thank everybody for all of the support and good wishes during this period of transition.  We have some other new members besides myself today—Governor Kevin Warsh to my left, Governor Randall Kroszner, and First Vice President Bill Stone, who is really not a newcomer. MR. STONE.  No, I’m not a newcomer.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good.  As you know, this two-day meeting has some experimental aspects.  Today we’ll be focusing on the state of the economy and the economic outlook.  Tomorrow we’ll focus on the policy issues, and then we’ll have some opportunities to talk about the meeting itself—the structure and how we want to go forward.  But we’ll start, as usual, with the Desk.  Dino. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial markets were characterized by a continuation of the fairly benign trends that we have observed over the past few months, with narrow spreads, low volatilities, strong equity markets, and flat yield curves—all set against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop.    The top two panels graph the three-month deposit rate for the dollar, the euro, and the yen and the respective three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates.  The compression of the dashed red lines toward the cash rate reflects the view of market participants that the Committee is nearing the end of the tightening cycle.  In contrast, forward rates for euro-area deposits are rising, and the spread with the cash rate has widened substantially since last fall as market participants began to revise up their forecasts of European growth and the likely path of monetary policy.  Indeed, the European Central Bank (ECB) has increased its policy rate twice, by 25 basis points per move, to 2½ percent since December, and expectations are in place for two or three additional 25 basis point tightening steps between now and year-end.  Japanese forward rates also rose in anticipation and then with the reality of the Bank of Japan’s announcement that it would terminate the quantitative easing policy and go back to targeting interest rates.  I’ll have more to say about that later.                                                    1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  With the increase in U.S. short-term rates and the stubbornness of the long end, the yield curve has stayed flat.  The bottom panel graphs the two- to ten-year spread since June 2004, or roughly when the tightening cycle began.  The Chairman’s recent speech on the subject notwithstanding, market participants remain divided about the implications of the flat, or slightly inverted, yield curve.   Turning to page 2, the economic news coming from Japan has been interpreted as pointing to an improved outlook.  Maybe it’s not a new era for Japan, but at a minimum it looks like a new chapter for the world’s second largest economy.  The top left panel graphs the Bank of Japan’s current account balances since January 2001.  Just about five years ago, the target current account balance (CAB) became the BOJ’s chief operating instrument.  Although required reserves have been in the range of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen, the BOJ successively raised its target for CABs to as much as 35 trillion yen.  Two weeks ago, the BOJ announced that it would end the quantitative easing policy and go back to targeting the overnight call rate.  Most likely it will take about three months for the BOJ to drain the excess reserves in the system.  The call rate itself is expected to continue to trade near 0 percent well into autumn.  Among the factors that allowed the BOJ to take this step were signs that deflation was ebbing and that bank lending was no longer contracting (as shown in the top right and middle left panels).  Meanwhile, the health of the financial system has improved, particularly that of the largest banks, as shown by the middle right panel, which graphs equity indexes for the broad Topix and bank sub-index.  Along with forward rates, yields at longer maturities have also begun to reflect this improved picture.  The bottom panel graphs two- and five-year yields since 2001.  The 2-year Japanese government bond yields about 60 basis points—up from a low of about 3 or 4 basis points in 2002 and 2003.  Five-year rates have risen from about 20 basis points at the low to 1.25 percent.   The view is brighter in Europe as well, even if performance lags other regions.  European equities have risen broadly over the past fifteen months, as shown in the top panel of page 3.  Sovereign yields have risen, though there is still a gap with comparable U.S. yields.  The ten-year German bund yields about 3.65 percent, compared with just above 3 percent six months ago.  Meanwhile, there are signs of life in Germany—Europe’s largest economy—particularly in the export sector.  The improved business sentiment is reflected in the steadily rising Ifo business survey in the middle right panel.    With G3 and other major economies such as Canada, China, and India all doing well, it’s not surprising that the overall market environment looks favorable.  In fact, one has to go far out in the periphery to find any signs of stress.  The bottom panel graphs the performance of selected currencies against the dollar through Friday’s close.  Besides the euro and yen for reference, the other currencies are those that have been mentioned as popular with the investors engaged in so-called carry trades.  In the past few weeks, some of these positions have been scaled back, and these currencies have weakened substantially in some cases.  Now let me confess that I hesitated to include this chart.  The previous Chairman chided me once for showing a similar chart that included the New Zealand dollar—the currency of a country with a mere 4 million residents.  Well, I am probably skating on very thin ice with the new Chairman, now that the kiwi has returned along with that powerhouse the Icelandic krona, the currency of a country with about 250,000 residents or roughly one-tenth the size of Brooklyn.  The point is not to suggest that Iceland is on the verge of joining the G7 but rather that the search for yield went to some pretty distant and unlikely places—as we are now discovering.  It does raise questions about other sectors that leveraged money went into and about which we don’t yet know.  The optimistic viewpoint is that carry trades in some of these peripheral markets have been scaled back without broader ripple effects—and that these markets have been repriced to levels that seem more appropriate.   On page 4, the top panel graphs the familiar emerging-market and high-yield spreads since the bull market began in October 2002.  The EMBI+ spread continues to narrow to new record lows.  Reflecting that benign environment, Mexico and Brazil continued their easing campaigns, and Indian and Chinese equities continued to rally.  At the January meeting, I spoke about the bullish factors pushing emerging-really hasn’t tightened further since early 2004.      The middle panel shows the rating composition of high-yield issuance since 1988.  Issuance shot higher in 2003 and 2004—mostly to refinance, to extend maturities, and in general to repair balance sheets.  Very little of that was for investment.  Issuance fell sharply in 2005 and is running at that pace if one annualizes issuance for the first three months of 2006.  That issuance continues to be largely for refinancing debt and increasingly for financing leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, payments of special dividends, and other forms of financial engineering.  Some of these are likely to show up as defaults in the future.   Meanwhile, actual defaults—as shown in the bottom panel—are low and show no signs of increasing.  Note that defaults typically start increasing a couple of years before the onset of recession, which is not surprising since the weakest corporations are less able to absorb a change in business climate.  So if a flat or inverted yield curve suggests possible weakness ahead, the low default rate for this sector is one indicator pointing the other way.    Turning to page 5, I have some words about recent challenges regarding reserve management.  Besides the usual anticipation effects that we have seen in past maintenance periods when the market expected a rate hike at an FOMC meeting, the funds rate and our management of reserves in the current maintenance period—which ends on Wednesday—was heavily influenced by reserve management at one large money center bank:  the Bank of New York.   In the top panel, the effects of the market’s expectation of a policy rate hike at this meeting are reflected in the smooth upward progression in the morning federal funds rate—shown by the blue circles.  At the start of this maintenance period, the funds rate in the morning was right at the current 4½ percent target.  Morning rates have risen steadily over the period, and this morning they stood right around the expected new target of 4¾ percent.  This pattern reflects the kind of gradual approach to the expected new target that we have seen in most maintenance periods since the start of the tightening cycle in June 2004.   Typically in these maintenance periods, the Desk has tried to lean modestly against the anticipation effects by providing relatively more reserves in the days before the FOMC meeting.  But in the current maintenance period, these efforts were overwhelmed by reserve management at the Bank of New York (BONY), which had an unusually high level of requirements.  BONY’s high requirements—around $4 billion on a period-average basis both last period and in the current period—resulted from as-of adjustments applied in these two maintenance periods to compensate for its past underreporting of reservable deposits.  Its normal requirements are only around $100 million.  In anticipation of higher rates in the latter part of this maintenance period, BONY met virtually all its elevated requirements over the first four business days of the period and then held near zero balances over the remainder of the period.  BONY had indicated to us its intention of managing its reserve balances in this way.  But for the first couple of days we only partly accommodated their increased demand, in large measure because the amounts seemed implausibly high and also because our experience has shown that banks’ stated intentions and actual behaviors don’t always line up.   Frankly, we were quite surprised at how inelastic BONY’s demand proved to be.  Its holdings in the first couple of days effectively created a reserve shortage at all other banks in the system.  The funds rate soared late in the day on each of these days, even well above the expected new target level, and there was considerable borrowing at the primary credit facility.  Nonetheless, BONY sold very few reserves back into the market.  For the next couple of days, then, the Desk elevated its provision of reserves to fully accommodate BONY’s stated objectives for reserve holdings.  As a result, the funds rate was much less volatile and remained so for the rest of the period, even as morning rates tended to reflect more of the anticipation effects of the expected rate hike.   This episode illustrates the potential effect that just one bank with a large level of requirements can have on the entire funds market when it dramatically adjusts its reserve holdings in a very inelastic fashion.  If the Desk is aware of these plans and can have confidence that the bank’s actions will conform to its stated plans, then it can compensate in its provision of reserve supply.  But it may not always be possible to meet these conditions.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  On the end of quantitative easing, what are the technical barriers to withdrawing the extra reserves that set three months or four months as being the expected time?   MR. KOS.  They have a series of operations into the future; they own, for example, Treasury bills that may have certain maturities.  They may have repurchase operations, which initially they started with short-term repos, and then they extended the maturity of those repos even as far as nine months, I think, at the far end.  So they could take draining actions, but a more passive way would be just to let those operations mature, and then you have a natural drain that happens without taking active steps as it were.  So three months is a reasonable estimate for their ability to let a lot of those reserves drain passively without taking overt draining steps, although they may have to do some of that as well if they want to do in about three months.  They could accelerate the process, but my sense is that they would rather not. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What does the market make of this “understanding” that inflation is between 0 and 2 percent in Japan?   MR. KOS.  I think people are taking the Bank of Japan at its word—that is, the members were polled, and each individual’s understanding of price stability was within that range.  They’ve said it repeatedly, and I think people are accepting that it’s not an inflation target per se—although whether it’s more like an inflation goal, who knows?  I think that’s one of those subjects that will provide a lot of grist for discussion. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Finally, how much of the movement in the long-term Japanese government bonds reflected inflation expectations?  They have inflation-linked bonds. MR. KOS.  They do, and I’m trying to remember what they did.  They did widen out somewhat, but very little.  But if memory serves me right, I believe that their breakevens were in the area of 50 to 60 basis points in the ten- to twenty-year period.  So there isn’t a huge premium built in, at least into the breakevens. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Dino?  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Two questions, Dino.  On the fed funds rate, I notice we have a high of 6½ percent one day and 5¾ the other.  You said there was considerable borrowing.  But is the Lombard window still seen as insufficiently available to cap the rate, or is it just that there were hardly any trades up there? MR. KOS.  There were some trades.  I think what we’ve observed at the Desk in talking to bank reserve managers is that some banks are taking us at our word and are not afraid to step up and borrow—and are not afraid to arbitrage against those who still feel the stigma.  But, clearly, some banks still think that coming to the window carries a stigma, and so you do have, to some degree, those that are willing to take us at our word and take advantage and those that are not.  And a lot of that bias seems to reflect the feelings of senior management.  The trader sometimes doesn’t want to go to the senior manager and say, “I want to go to the window.”   MR. REINHART.  I would also point out, Governor Kohn, on the day in which there was trading at 6½, above the Lombard rate, one large money center bank borrowed from the window and then couldn’t place it.  Subsequently, the bank wound up holding a portion of the funds itself. MR. KOHN.  My second question has to do with New Zealand and Iceland.  I guess I thought you ascribed this entirely to an unwinding of the carry trade.  But I thought there were other things going on.  I thought that there were some very weak data for New Zealand, so that despite the some Scandinavian bank about problems in the Icelandic banking systems.  I hesitate to ascribe this situation entirely to the carry trade. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’d like a full report on the Icelandic— [Laughter] MR. KOS.  I thought that the Committee’s patience might be limited.  Yes, there was a downgrade by one of the rating agencies of Iceland.  There were some concerns about some of the Icelandic banks, and so that seemed to be part of the story.  You did have some weak data in New Zealand, and I guess the central bank there is now expected to be easing over the course of the next year.  So some other things were going on.  Yet another factor affecting New Zealand—which, again, may be more detail than you want—is that Japanese retail investors have been big buyers of these Uridashis, which I know you know about.  And some of that money is now flowing back.  Thus, a number of factors are affecting it.  Again, at the next meeting I will give you a full report.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  This suggests that the Bank of New York really paid a lot in opportunity costs to hold those reserves early.  Is that your sense?  And, if so, do you have a sense of why they were interested in paying up to hold the reserves early? MR. KOS.  Well, I guess I would look at it slightly differently.  They held the reserves early in the period at a lower rate because they were anticipating that— MR. LACKER.  Yes.  But they could have lent them out later in the day at a lot more, right?   MR. KOS.  Oh, I see what you mean.  Yes. MR. LACKER.  The opportunity cost at the end of the day was pretty high. MR. KOS.  Yes.  I can only speculate, but my sense is that they had a plan for how they wanted to manage reserves in the period.  They didn’t, then, want to game the system as it were, given that they themselves were responsible for some of the issues during this period.  So for them  something that they wanted to do. MR. LACKER.  Okay.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Well, actually, I’m sorry, but I want to follow up on the zloty.  [Laughter]  And, by the way, there are 24 million sheep and close to 4 million people in New Zealand.  But I’m curious, just thinking about trip wires, one would think, as you said, that as rates rise and with better credits, one would move away from emerging-market currencies.  Do you see any undue concentrations, or do you think that this might roll over, say, to the Latin Americans and some others? MR. KOS.  Right now, there are no signs of that.  Again, the hard data that we have are limited.  So some of this information is anecdotal, and some of it we are reading from price relationships and correlations that we see.  Right now, I can’t tell you that there is any evidence to suggest that the Latin currencies might be next.  The situation seems to have been fairly isolated so far.  My point in raising this issue is that, basically, the world looks pretty good right now.  Markets look pretty good.  Again, you’re going to have to go to Iceland to find some signs of strain.  So, overall, the picture is positive.  But it’s useful to remind ourselves that some leveraged money out there has gone off into some fairly obscure places. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I’d note that the former president of Harvard is advocating diversifying portfolios in these kinds of currencies. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan.  MS. MINEHAN.  This is probably beating a subject to death.  But I want to follow up on the Bank of New York situation and the upward tick of the fed funds rate in the period leading up to what the market anticipates will be a change in our rates.  If you can remember back to when we didn’t provide a lot of guidance, did we have this same kind of thing based on market expectations? MR. KOS.  No.  It has been a phenomenon in this sense in this cycle.  Governor Kohn will remember better than I do, perhaps.  You might have gotten anticipation effects in the day or two before meetings, when there were keen expectations, but you didn’t see them on the first day of the reserve maintenance period, which is what we see now. MS. MINEHAN.  Right.  And nothing as dramatic.  You’ve talked about this before, but it is quite graphic here. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If there are no other questions, I need a motion to ratify domestic market operations. SEVERAL.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Mr. Stockton. MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought that I would address three related questions in my remarks this afternoon.  First, how much momentum is there in current economic activity?  Second, how close is the Committee to having put in place sufficient restraint to prevent output from overshooting its potential, with attendant consequences for inflation?  And finally, how do we view the current state of resource utilization, and what are the implications of that assessment for the inflation outlook?   Let me turn first to the question of momentum.  At the last FOMC meeting, I indicated that the staff was in a state of denial concerning the meager 1 percent rate of increase in real GDP that the BEA had just published as their advance estimate for the fourth quarter of last year.  We were skeptical that the growth of output had actually been that weak, and we thought that growth, to the extent it had been soft, would bounce back sharply in the current quarter.  I am relieved to report that subsequent developments appear to have supported that interpretation.  We now estimate that growth of real GDP was about 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter—noticeably above the advance reading and about halfway back to our January Greenbook projection.  Moreover, activity appears to be snapping back in the current quarter.  We estimate that real output is growing at a pace of more than 4½ percent this quarter.   Although, in broad strokes, those developments paint a picture close to that which we envisioned in January, we have had our share of surprises to contend with.  Most notably, consumer spending and business spending have been considerably stronger than we had projected.  Real PCE is projected to have advanced at an annual rate of 5¼ percent this quarter.  Some of that strength reflects a bounceback in motor vehicle purchases.  But even setting that aside, real PCE appears on track for a 4¼ percent increase in the current quarter, nearly a percentage point faster than we had projected in the January Greenbook.   In the business sector, we are projecting an increase in real outlays for equipment and software of nearly 15 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter.  Like consumer outlays, real spending for E&S has been boosted by motor vehicle sales this quarter, and it has received a further bump-up from a recovery in aircraft deliveries.  But even abstracting from the jump in spending on transportation equipment, real E&S is expected to increase at a 10 percent annual rate in the current quarter, nearly 3 percentage points faster than we had previously projected.   Our surprises have also extended beyond the spending data. Gains in private payroll employment were revised up in the fourth quarter and averaged about 200,000 per month in January and February—a bit above our expectation.  Those job gains, coupled with a higher-than-expected workweek, raised the growth in hours worked in the current quarter to more than 3 percent at an annual rate, nearly 2 percentage points faster than we had anticipated in January.  The readings on manufacturing industrial production have also exceeded our expectations.  Factory output is now estimated to have increased at a 9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and is projected to increase at a 6 percent rate in the current quarter; those increases are, respectively, 1 percentage point and ½ percentage point greater than we had written down in  This rather lengthy litany might suggest that the answer to the first question that I posed should be that there is a great deal more momentum to activity than we had earlier expected.  But, in fact, for two reasons, I’d characterize the situation as one in which we perceive just a little more momentum.  First, we have had some downside surprises as well upside ones.  For example, construction activity in the business sector and by state and local governments has fallen short of our expectations.  The biggest downside surprise, however, has come from the external sector, where a surge in imports in the first quarter suggests that some of the additional strength in domestic spending was met by foreign rather than domestic producers.   A second reason for not interpreting all the recent strength as added momentum is that we can already see evidence, admittedly tentative, that some of the strength in the first quarter will be transitory.  For one, the jump in federal spending in the first quarter mostly reflects a rebound from a low level of outlays in the fourth quarter, and given this year’s federal budget, real purchases should only edge up over the remainder of the year.  In addition, some of the strength in the current quarter reflects the effects of favorable weather in January and February on housing construction.  And, finally, the data on retail sales, shipments of capital goods, and industrial production suggest that most of the impetus to rapid first-quarter growth in these areas occurred early in the quarter; recent readings have been more subdued.   A bit more momentum in private domestic demands, coupled with higher prices for equities and houses and lower prices for imported crude oil, led us to revise up the growth of real GDP by a tenth both this year and next.  But these are really just minor tweaks to an outlook that is much the same as it was seven weeks ago.   If our forecast for the current quarter is close to the mark, the growth of real GDP over the past four quarters will have been 3½ percent—about the same pace that we have averaged over the past two years.  To me, that seems like a very reasonable estimate of the current underlying pace of the expansion.  The gradual decline in the unemployment rate and the rise in capacity utilization over the past year suggest that this pace has been above the sustainable trend rate of growth, but just by a little.   That assessment helps to explain our answer to the question of how much more restraint will be necessary to head off the inflation pressures that could follow from a serious overshooting by output of its potential.  Our answer is not much more restraint—in part because we don=t think that the pace of activity will, in fact, need to slow much.  We are assuming that the funds rate is raised to 5 percent by May and then is held at that level through the middle of next year.  In our view, that will be sufficient to slow the growth of real GDP from its current pace of 3½ percent to a 3 percent rate next year and to tip inflation down.  As growth slows slightly below potential and core inflation edges down, the federal funds rate is assumed to be lowered a bit in the middle of next year.    As has been the case for some time, housing is central to our forecast of some modest deceleration of activity.  Residential investment has been contributing about ½ percentage point to the growth of real GDP over the past few years.  So a flattening out of activity in this sector would, by itself, be sufficient to bring about the necessary slowing in aggregate production.  And, roughly speaking, that is what we are forecasting.  A few months ago, the deceleration in housing activity that we were projecting was not yet evident in the data.  But since then, the data have been providing increasing support for our view that housing is in the process of softening.  On net, both new and existing home sales have retreated from last summer’s peaks, household sentiment toward homebuying has turned down, and builder attitudes have deteriorated.  Even house-price appreciation appears to have slowed in recent quarters—to be sure, not quite as much as we thought it would, but at least it now seems to be moving in the anticipated direction.  About the only housing indicator not signaling some softening is the starts figures themselves.  However, as I noted earlier, we think that starts were boosted considerably by favorable weather in January and some fallback in starts in the months ahead.   I’m tempted to chalk this situation up as a victory for the staff projection, where victory is defined as any aspect of our forecast not immediately contradicted by the data.  But I’m afraid that there is still plenty of scope for surprise in the housing sector.  Last week=s reports for February showing an increase in existing home sales and a decline in new home sales certainly highlight contrasting risks.  And although we have been encouraged by the recent slowing in home prices, those data hardly confirm that a deceleration in house prices is under way.  Nor, for that matter, do they rule out that we are at the front edge of a more abrupt collapse in prices.  Right now, it feels a bit like riding a roller coaster with one’s eyes shut.  We sense that we=re going over the top, but we just don’t know what lies below.    It is, of course, an oversimplification to suggest that housing is the only risk to achieving our forecast of a slowdown with only a minimal amount of additional tightening.  But housing is prominent because we are forecasting it to break from its steady uptrend of the past few years.   In contrast, the growth of consumption and the growth of business fixed investment are projected to slow only a bit between 2006 and 2007 and to remain on solid upward trajectories.  Growth in real PCE is projected to average about 3½ percent over the forecast period.  Higher interest rates and waning wealth effects from earlier increases in equity and house prices should act to damp the growth in consumer spending.  But a pickup in the growth of labor income and a diminishing drag from higher energy prices on the growth of purchasing power nearly offset those influences.    In the business sector, the growth of fixed investment is projected to average about 6½ percent over the forecast period.  It slows a bit in response to the sheets should provide support to equipment spending; declining vacancy rates and ongoing gains in employment are expected to lift office construction; and high energy prices should provide some continuing stimulus to drilling activity.   So housing takes center stage in our projected slowing in aggregate activity, and consumption and investment play small supporting roles.  We expect the growth of real GDP by early next year to run about 3 percent, a bit less than our estimate of the growth of potential output.  Consequently, by the end of the forecast period, the unemployment rate edges back up toward 5 percent, our estimate of the NAIRU.   This brings me to the third question:  How do we assess the current state of resource utilization?  In setting our forecast, we are required to take a stand on a point estimate for the NAIRU and potential output.  But we recognize, as I’m sure you do, that we are being forced to split hairs here.  In reality, the confidence interval around our estimate of the NAIRU is very wide.  A 70 percent confidence interval is roughly plus or minus ¾ percentage point, and a 90 percent confidence interval is about plus or minus 1 percentage point.  Moreover, Board staff members have done considerable research that highlights just how tentative real-time estimates of the NAIRU and potential output can be.  At this point, all we can say is that you are well within a wide zone of uncertainty as to whether the economy is approaching, has reached, or has already overshot the NAIRU.   Some recent developments could be read as pointing to greater slack than we are currently estimating.  The relatively small gains in the employment cost index (ECI) over the past couple of years have been well below that expected by our models, offering the strongest evidence in favor of a lower NAIRU.  Other wage and price measures, however, offer a more mixed assessment.  Hourly labor compensation, as measured in the national accounts, also decelerated last year to a modest pace of 3¾ percent, slower than the rate predicted by our models.  But that came on the heels of a 6 percent increase in 2004 that was above the models, with the pattern between the years likely affected by some large swings in stock option exercises.  On average over the two years, this measure of hourly compensation has run a bit above model predictions.   As for price developments, our core PCE equations employing a 5 percent NAIRU were on track until recently.  But in the last few quarters, core PCE price inflation has come in a bit below those equations.  Thus far, these residuals are small.  Moreover, interpreting the reasons for the recent misses is not straightforward.  The misses may reflect a lower level of the NAIRU, but they could also be signaling a smaller pass-through of higher prices for energy, imports, and other commodities.  And, of course, they could simply be noise.  In the end, we thought that we had not accumulated enough evidence against our 5 percent NAIRU to make a change at this point, but we will certainly be monitoring this aspect of our forecast closely in the months ahead.    To be sure, an overshoot of the NAIRU of modest dimensions, even if sustained over a couple of years, would likely result in only a small and gradual updrift in the underlying rate of inflation, given how flat the aggregate supply curve appears to be.  Of course, the flip side to a shallow aggregate supply curve is that it would also be more costly to reverse whatever inflation might build up over that period.    All told, we made only minor adjustments to our inflation forecast in this Greenbook, as neither the price data nor the major determinants of price inflation presented major surprises.  On net, core PCE appears to be coming in close to our earlier expectations.  However, that reflected some small offsetting errors.  The nonmarket component of core PCE was higher than we had expected, whereas the frequency movements in the market-based measure, we are inclined to interpret recent consumer price developments as being a touch more favorable than we had expected.  Projected oil prices also have been marked down, especially in the near term, reducing some pressure on business costs. Working in the other direction has been the reacceleration in the prices of materials and imported goods since last autumn, a further rise in capacity utilization, and a lower unemployment rate.  Taken together, these developments caused us to trim a tenth from this year’s core PCE inflation and to add a tenth to next year’s rate, putting our projection at 2 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year.  In sum, our outlook is for pretty stable inflation.    I’ll conclude my remarks this afternoon by pointing out some changes that we made in the Greenbook this round, starting with our presentation of the financial assumptions.  It has now been seventeen years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and fifteen years since the end of the old Soviet regime, so it didn’t seem like rushing things for the staff to engage in little glasnost ourselves.  Therefore we have now laid out the details of our financial assumptions in the Greenbook.  As you know, we had already been moving in that direction, and doing so seemed like a logical and useful step toward greater transparency on our part.   We have also made some important changes in our construction of the alternative simulations and confidence intervals.  We are now reporting only the versions of the simulations that employ the Taylor rule.  This has the virtues of reducing the number of permutations that we present and of focusing on the ones that seem most relevant—that is, on the simulations in which policy begins to react to the shocks within the simulation period.  To further facilitate their interpretation, we have added a chart that presents the baseline path for the funds rate, an accompanying confidence interval, and the policy paths that are generated by the Taylor rule for each of the alternative scenarios.  Finally, we shortened the sample period over which we generate confidence intervals for the Greenbook forecast and those that are generated by stochastic simulations of the model.  We now start those calculations in 1986, rather than in 1978.  When we first started reporting these confidence intervals four years ago, we choose the longer sample on the concern that we couldn’t rule out shocks like those experienced in the 1970s.  Subsequently, we have had shocks similar to those in that period, and the Great Moderation still appears to be holding.  So we think a stronger argument can now be made for using the more recent period.  All in all, we hope these changes make the document a little clearer and a little more useful.  Karen will continue our presentation.   MS. JOHNSON.  We now have complete fourth-quarter data for U.S. trade and the balance of payments.  Several elements of those data seem to me to be worth mentioning at this meeting as they correspond to issues with which we have wrestled in putting together the international portion of your Greenbook forecast.    The U.S. current account deficit came in at an annual rate of $900 billion in the fourth quarter—7 percent of nominal GDP.  The jump from the previous quarter was sizable, and the number gives me, at least, a bit of sticker shock.  With $900 billion already recorded, it is not surprising that our forecast for the current account deficit crosses $1 trillion and reaches about 8 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period.  With the U.S. economy projected to perform well through the end of next year, we have no reason to expect that the financing of such a large deficit will cause problems in foreign exchange and asset markets.  But the risk of such problems is again a factor in the forecast.    The deficit on goods and services, at $790 billion, accounts for most of the fourth-quarter current account deficit.  Of that figure, the non-oil merchandise balance is about 70 percent.  The balance on trade in services is actually a small positive.  We look for the bill for imported oil and the balance on services trade to change little through the end of 2007.  However, we expect that the non-oil merchandise balance will widen significantly over the forecast period, contributing a little more than one-half of the increase in the current account deficit, and that deterioration of net investment income will largely explain the remainder.  Net investment income had remained stubbornly positive even as the United States became a large net international debtor.  The initial release of fourth-quarter balance of payments data shows a small negative for net investment income.  Even if that negative is subsequently revised away, we expect a negative change in the income balance through the end of next year that is almost as large as the widening in the non-oil merchandise trade balance.  The decline we anticipate in net investment income reflects both the growing U.S. net debt position and the projected rise over time in the interest rates applied to our net position in fixed-income assets.   The information available to us about the financing of the external deficit for last year as a whole supports our view that there is no basis for expecting an imminent, disruptive consequence for asset markets of the growing U.S. external imbalance.  In 2005, private foreign investors made net purchases of U.S. securities that totaled almost as much as the entire current account deficit.  This category of financial flows increased greatly from the previous year, consistent with upward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets over much of that time.  The appetite of private foreign investors for corporate and municipal bonds was particularly strong.  Foreign direct investment into the United States also rose during 2005 to a figure that is quite robust, even if not at the scale of the extremely large inflows in the late 1990s and 2000.  The offsetting flows of direct investment abroad by U.S. entities were small, reflecting the temporary, favorable tax break on repatriated foreign earnings.    Reported foreign official holdings of dollars in the United States did increase last year, but at a rate significantly below that in 2004.  Of the $217 billion increase in foreign official holdings reported in the Greenbook for 2005, a very large portion is due to increased official holdings by China.  Although official Japanese holdings of dollar assets had significantly risen in 2004, the ending of exchange market intervention by Japanese authorities in March of that year resulted in no further official acquisition of dollar assets last year by them.  Oil exporters, particularly Russia, accounted in 2005 for a moderate share of the change in foreign official dollar holdings.  All told, foreign official acquisition of dollar assets does not appear to have been a dominant feature in the picture of financial flows painted by the balance of payments statistics for last year.   Beyond the current quarter, our baseline forecast calls for real exports of goods and services to expand at an annual rate of 5 percent.  This export growth mainly reflects our outlook for real GDP growth abroad.  We project that, over the final three quarters of this year, average real output growth abroad will be comparable to that of the U.S. economy; for next year, we expect foreign growth to exceed U.S. growth by about ¼ percentage point.  We see the global expansion as broadly based across regions, with real GDP growth in the emerging market economies significantly faster than that in the industrial countries, but with both groups doing well.  We expect that, among the foreign industrial countries, Canada and the United Kingdom will continue to be relatively strong and Japan’s recovery will become well established, although its rate of output growth will abate somewhat going forward.  Among the Asian emerging market economies, we look for a slowing in the rate of growth from recent rates, importantly in China, but expect that on average those economies will maintain a pace of expansion of nearly 6 percent.  In Latin America, we project that our major trading partners will all see solid growth that averages almost 4 percent this year and a bit less next year.   Although the dollar moved up slightly over the intermeeting period, we again forecast some dollar depreciation in real terms, as we remain mindful of the financing requirements posed by our external deficits.  Over time, that depreciation should work to boost our real exports, although for the forecast period the lagged effects of dollar appreciation during 2005 are more dominant and the contribution from the dollar diminishes rather than strengthens through the end of 2007.  Dollar depreciation should add somewhat to import price inflation this year and next.  However, changes in global commodity prices have been sizable and have largely determined the path of nonfuel core import prices.  Prices of global nonfuel commodities have ratcheted up further in recent months.  Futures prices for these commodities indicate some future flattening, but lagged responses to these increases should boost core import price inflation to 3 percent this year before some deceleration occurs next year.    Our projections for the U.S. economy, for relative prices of nonfuel imports, and for global energy prices combine to imply a rate of growth for real imports of goods and services over the remaining seven quarters of the forecast period that is slightly greater than that for exports.  With nominal imports currently more than 150 percent of nominal exports, the resulting implication for the nominal trade deficit is inevitably a further widening.  In our baseline for this Greenbook, the contribution of exports to U.S. real GDP growth for the rest of this year and next is, at an annual rate, just a bit more than 0.5 percentage point.  The arithmetic contribution from imports varies by quarter, in part because of the way real imports are seasonally adjusted.  On average, imports subtract more than exports add, resulting in a net negative contribution to GDP growth from the external sector that is 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point at an annual rate.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Dave, I was struck by the alternative scenario in which productivity growth is slower because, even with the Taylor rule in place, it makes inflation rise rather than nominal compensation growth fall.  So I was just wondering, does that result convey a lack of credibility in the estimated Taylor rule, or what do you think is going on there?  MR. STOCKTON.  I think it just reflects the fact that these cost pressures develop rather quickly in that slowing scenario and that they are passed through one-for-one into prices, and the Taylor rule is responding slowly to that pickup in inflation.  But when you say “credibility” of the Taylor rule, the outcome-based version of the Taylor rule is what we show in the Bluebook.  That is not an optimal policy, of course.  That is an estimated rule based on past observations about monetary policy responses.  So it was just a straightforward mechanical read of what that rule produces. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I have a comment and a question.  Karen, you speak of the capital inflow to the United States as financing the current account deficit.  Surely these are simultaneously determined.  In addition, I think the shorthand statement is probably better the other way around:  The private investors are moving funds not for the purpose of financing the current account deficit but to finance their own investments.  That is why they are moving the funds.  And it is probably better shorthand to say that the current account is financing the capital account inflow as a consequence of where the exchange rate is bid with the capital flowing in. My question relates to a different topic—the oil price situation.  You hear a lot of market commentary to the effect that maybe $10 a barrel is in there because of uncertainties about Iran, Nigeria, and elsewhere.  When you look at U.S. data, you know that inventory is building—certainly refined products—and clearly you cannot have a $10 plug in there forever if there is no supply disturbance.  Eventually the inventories accumulate, and the price will weaken.  What do we know about petroleum inventories, both crude and refined products, around the world?  The Greenbook, Part 2, has the U.S. data, but what do we know about elsewhere in the world? MS. JOHNSON.  I just cannot resist the temptation to make a brief response to your comment, and then I will answer your question.  [Laughter]   MR. POOLE.  Which is fine. MS. JOHNSON.  You know, one can approach a general equilibrium process in any number of ways, and finding things that are truly exogenous to that process is very, very difficult.  So it is certainly true that the capital flows might be exogenous.  However, my guess is they are responding to endogenous economic activity in the United States and the way we are behaving.  Trade is certainly endogenous.  Saving and investment behavior has some exogenous characteristics and some endogenous characteristics.  I take your point, but it is still nonetheless true that, even if the rest of the world wants to invest in the United States, if we saved more, we would not have to borrow just because they wished to lend.  And our saving more would have an implication for asset prices and exchange rates and incomes that would lead to a generally improved outcome that would, over time, have a different characteristic than the one that we have observed.  So no one exogenous thing is driving everything else, and that statement is as true for the capital flow part of the story as it would be to say that the current account is the driver and everything else is in response. MR. POOLE.  I think we are in perfect agreement on the economics.  It is just the way in which we are talking about the situation. MS. JOHNSON.  We have very little information on inventories elsewhere.  There are data through the International Energy Agency on inventories in countries belonging to the OECD, but they really do not tell us much, and, to be honest, I do not have them with me.  The information may be buried here somewhere, but I do not know that I have it, and I will not take the time to look for it.  The picture of where inventories are is generally incomplete, particularly because the major Mideast producers and the major emerging market producers are not reporting their inventories to the OECD.  The inquiry is unanswerable. Now an effort, of which the United States is very supportive, is under way to improve the quality of the data in the energy markets, and that effort may some day speak to the question.  Some of these inventories may be in gas tanks next to factories or next to generators; some of them are held in huge tanks in ports.  The location varies hugely. All of that said, I always think that the risk premium in the oil futures curve must somehow resolve itself the way you suggest, but it is not something that happens over a short period of time.  The inventory behavior is strategic; it is not the residual.  It is every bit as much deliberate as anything else is.  And so, as a consequence, when oil supplies seem risky—as, say, the events in Nigeria of last week or the general situation in Iran—people want to hold more inventories.  So there may be upward support on that price until inventories reach the level at which people are happy, and then the price might recede; but it is not as if that price increase is somehow a purely financial phenomenon and has no economic consequences.  On a fundamental basis, price is driving that inventory accumulation, and it is consistent with the inventory accumulation that people want, given that they perceive supply to be risky. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  I have two brief questions, one for David and one for Karen.  To David, my question is whether or not you have changed your assessment of the normal gap that we should expect between the core CPI and the core PCE, since those two measures seem to give rather different readings about the strength of inflation pressures.  I have long thought that 0.4 or 0.5 was the natural differential to expect between those two measures.  But it looks as though, at the moment and perhaps going back several years, the average differential between the two measures may have narrowed to something closer to a quarter of a point.  We have talked about this as a mystery, but I wonder whether, because it is persistent, we should not be benchmarking our view of the core CPI at a slightly different place than, say, 2 being the equivalent to 1½ on the PCE. And for Karen, my question has to do with the evolution of net exports and the difference between your persistent forecast of worsening net exports and the forecast of Macroeconomic Advisers, which you have probably looked at, which projects a turnaround.  David mentioned that we only need to see a modest slowing or a downturn in the housing sector to realize sustainable growth going forward.  But that assessment is contingent on what’s forecast for every other component of aggregate demand.  As I compare the Greenbook forecast to Macroeconomic Advisers’ forecast, the thing that really stands out, and has stood out for quite a long time, as a consistent, strong difference is the Greenbook’s forecast that net exports will be a growing drag on the economy and Macroeconomic Advisers’ view that net exports are just poised to turn up.  I assume that the difference comes down to differences in your assessments of the effects of past depreciation of the dollar on net exports.  My question is, Is that right?  I am assuming that you are well aware of this difference, and I am just curious to know what your perspective is on that. MR. STOCKTON.  I will start out with the gap.  Indeed, we have been surprised by the strength in the nonmarket component of PCE prices, and in this forecast round, we revised up our implicit projection for that component going forward.  Over the next two years, we are looking at a gap that is expected to narrow from where it was, and it is more likely to be ¼ percentage point or so.  And, as you know, we do not have a good model for the nonmarket component of core PCE.  So much of what we are doing is trying to gauge what that gap has been and where it will be, rather than modeling it on the basis of an economic behavioral set of equations.  Thus I would suggest that we have had in our own minds a slight recalibration of that gap in the direction that you were suggesting, at least for the next two years. MS. YELLEN.  We have noticed a change in the relationship between the core CPI and the chained core CPI, which suggested to us that maybe something is going on relating to substitution bias at the upper level of the index.  You focused on the nonmarket component of the PCE, and I wondered if something unusual might be happening with the core CPI relative to other measures. MR. STOCKTON.  That change or, in essence, the weighting bias portion of the CPI, looking at the chain versus the Laspeyres version has that moved around a lot—more so than we had any reason to believe it would when chain weighting was implemented.  Again, we have just flowed along with that rather than actually thinking that there has been some fundamental change—that the substitution bias has gotten significantly larger or significantly smaller—but we have been impressed with how much it has moved on a year-to-year basis. MS. JOHNSON.  I don’t have as good an answer for you as I wish.  One of my concerns for some time now has been that the forecasts I observed from other reputable folk, and Macroeconomic Advisers is among them, do not contain as much deterioration in the external sector as our forecast because I interpret at least one possible resolution of that is that they and others and their customers are going to be surprised when they turn out to be wrong and we turn out to be right.  [Laughter]  And I ask myself, “What are these people drinking for breakfast?”  [Laughter]  I have some papers with me, and I can give you a quick answer.  Looking through to 2007, so over the whole forecast, they have lower real imports than we have, yet they have a stronger U.S. growth rate, on balance, and higher exports than we have.  Their dollar forecast is about like ours.  It has a small dollar depreciation in it.  The rest-of-the-world picture is not as fully articulated as ours, so I cannot really say, but I doubt very much that they have the rest of the world just growing like gangbusters and that just explains everything.  I have to assume that down deep they have something structural in their model that is either some combination of less asymmetry in the income elasticities on real imports versus real exports and/or more sensitivity to the exchange rate than the roughly 1 percent elasticity that we have.  How much is each of those pieces?  I do not know.  Let’s put it this way:  The number they have down here for the annual average for 2007 is below the $900 billion in the nominal current account balance that we have already achieved.  I cannot imagine that anybody looking right now at the global economy thinks that we have peaked in terms of the current account and that we are going to start improving.  I cannot imagine why anybody would think that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I just want to ask a question related to what Jeff Lacker was asking before.  I focused just on the alternative simulations.  I focused on the greater cost pressure simulation, which had in the second half of ’06 core PCE inflation going up to 2.6 percent and yet the fed funds rate was going up only to 5.1—0.1 over the baseline.  And this just did not seem to track with my intuition as to what we would be doing as a Committee if, in fact, we had such high rates of core PCE inflation in the second half of this year.  Now, I realize that you said this is based on history and that this is what the FOMC has done in the past, but I would hope that we wouldn’t do it in the future.  [Laughter]  I was wondering whether there is some other way to specify the policy response that might be more helpful to us as we consider what we would do in the future. MR. STOCKTON.  Certainly one option would be to provide some sense of what an optimal policy response would be.  A second option would be to use the kind of Taylor rule that we were using previously, which was just a calibrated Taylor rule.  We made a conscious decision in some sense not to do that, to try to harmonize what was shown in the Bluebook with what is shown in the Greenbook.  But I am getting some feedback from my customers here today, and I will certainly take that on board. There are two elements as to why the responses look as small as they do.  One is that inflation is extremely inertial.  And the policy rule has inertia in it as well.  As you know, we did a special presentation to the Committee a couple of years ago on why there are lagged interest rates in policy rules.  This rule is one that incorporates a lagged interest rate in it, so it produces considerably more inertia.  Obviously our hope is to provide something that you will find both credible and useful, and to the extent that we get feedback from you about what we could improve, we would be happy to make some adjustments in that. MR. REINHART.  Let me just make two other points, President Moskow.  The rule itself is explained in the table in the Bluebook, and I would add two more properties that Dave has mentioned.  One is that its estimation starts in 1988, and the implicit inflation goal in that rule you, I think, would find unacceptable because it includes a higher-inflation-rate period early in the sample.  Second, as Dave mentioned, in fact, there are two lags of the nominal funds rate in that quarterly predicted equation.  But I guess the other part of my response is, well, you have not told us what your inflation goal is, [laughter] and so we do not have many alternatives except to look at history to see how this Committee has acted.  And if you stretch back long enough to have a satisfactory time period over which to estimate the equation, you are probably going to misspecify what the inflation goal is. MR. MOSKOW.  Well, I know we have not specified an inflation goal, but I certainly think this could be below 2.6 percent because this actually has real rates coming down, as you point out in the alternative simulation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Dave, my question pertains to the labor market and resource utilization issue.  There is a comment in the Greenbook to the effect that the strong labor market will cause labor force participation rates to move up in the short run.  While that statement certainly sounds plausible, is there any evidence for that kind of effect? MR. STOCKTON.  No.  In fact, we have a slight 0.1 bump-up in the near term in the participation rate, but basically in our forecast the participation rate moves sideways. MR. STERN.  Yes, I saw that in the table. MR. STOCKTON.  And by having the actual participation move sideways to meet our trend that is moving down, we were trying to convey in essence that some implicit tightening is going on there.  So, in fact, we felt quite comfortable with what I recognize was a somewhat adventuresome forecast for the trend participation rate, which was to have it go down as much as we do in this projection.  But it looked pretty good over the past year as a forecast.  Even as the unemployment rate has come down, we really have not seen much of any recovery in participation, which makes us a bit more confident, or at least a bit more comfortable with our forecast, that participation is not going to be headed up significantly. MR. STERN.  Okay. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  I have a question for David and a customer request for Karen.  My question to David concerns the elasticity of labor supply within our own borders, and my specific question is the impact of immigration on the NAIRU.  I assume that we have had some benefit in lowering the NAIRU based on immigration, and I am wondering, David, if you have begun to calculate what the effect of these anti-immigration bills might be on the elasticity of labor supply. And my customer request to Karen:  One thing that I noticed particularly in reading through the Greenbook, beginning with the domestic section, is that we are hit between the eyes right off the bat with the question of capacity utilization and resource utilization.  The international section discussed net exports and growth figures.  Is there a way, Karen, that we can over time get a sense of what we get right to at the beginning of the domestic section:  the degree to which resources are being utilized outside the United States in a way that affects the decisionmaking of businessmen and businesswomen in the United States?  You know that I worry about this dynamic.  But I am curious as to whether we can get a measurement of the capacity of others to supply inputs into our economy or processes that not only facilitate economic growth but also affect inflation beyond just the prices of imported goods.  I do not see that as much in the international section.  I see at least the attempt to get to it, whether or not we agree analytically, in the domestic section. Those are my one question and my one request, if possible. MR. STOCKTON.  I can give you one answer and one waffle.  [Laughter]  The answer is “no,” we have not done any calculations to my knowledge of how the pending immigration reform bills would affect the natural rate.  I would really want to consult with my labor experts before I even ventured an answer about what the effect of increased immigration would be on the NAIRU.  One could imagine that the unemployment rates for those groups are higher than average and that immigration could actually be a factor boosting the NAIRU.  However, if immigration is affecting reservation wages of workers who are already here, there might be some movement along the labor supply schedule that could potentially lower the NAIRU.  So I guess I don’t want to shoot from the hip on that one.  That seems like a pretty hard question, and I’d want to do a bit of thinking about it. MR. FISHER.  Our guys—or at least the researchers we have in Dallas—tell us that a substantial portion of employment growth has been fed by immigration in the United States since 1990.  I don’t know the specific numbers, but I’m just worried and curious.  I have a question about whether cutting off that supply or changing the nature of that supply will affect us and, if so, how. MS. JOHNSON.  I’m just going to waffle right from the very beginning.  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  I hope my question wasn’t too waffley. MS. JOHNSON.  I’m not so sure exactly—we will give it thought.  There’s a fair amount of literature developing about global capacity utilization.  Is it defined?  We don’t talk, for example, about capacity utilization in Oklahoma.  We assume that if Oklahoma needs stuff from the rest of the United States, it just gets the stuff, and vice versa.  Why is the global economy any different?  Is the United States small enough relative to the whole world that it can just do that?  That’s sort of the epitome of the small open economy model whereby it can buy anything it needs at the going world price and it can sell all it wants at the going world price.  But if I take that model as my benchmark, it really does that all through prices.  It says that the small open economy can buy imported products, resources, inputs, whatever, just by knowing the prices, and sells to an infinitely elastic demand curve for its output. So it is certainly true that we have paid attention to things like global commodity prices and global energy prices, as the activities elsewhere in the world have shifted global demand and have moved those prices.  It is no end of frustrating to me that the futures markets always say that, however much those prices have gone up—or maybe even occasionally down—over the past so many weeks or months, they are going to flatten starting tomorrow.  You just get very little dynamic out of those futures prices.  No one is out there thinking about the global economy over the next three years, looking ahead at this, that, or the other thing.  On the other hand, we’ve talked about not using those futures prices, and I don’t know whether on our own we have the capacity to do better than those prices.  So I’m stuck.  But I understand the point, and it is certainly the case that huge changes—supply shocks to the global economy—are in some sense part of what’s happening and that they ought to have some repercussions for us.  Partly, I think, that’s a little bit of what’s going on in this notion of whether pass-through has declined over time. But we’ll give the subject some more thought, and we’ll see if we can come up with some other sorts of indications, such as bottlenecks, as when the shipping industry was having problems, whether it was just port congestion, huge prices on capacity, or something else.  You could trace back bottlenecks, and you could think about the consequences of them for the U.S. forecast, say.  But something that is more inclusive than particular bottlenecks for particular kinds of goods is a tougher question. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Dave and Karen, my question is basically to ask you to give me your sense of the risk.  In reading the Greenbook, I have a sense that the risk is balanced.  I see that interest rates go up and then they come back down.  So I understand that overall the risk is balanced in your view.  But what do you sense are some of the most pressing risks we have?  Because when you look at the alternative scenarios—and they’re very interesting—two of them, the productivity factor and the term premium on the yield curve, seem to have the greatest effect.  But what in this outlook do you sense is perhaps our greatest exposure?  I think that’s what we’re trying to anticipate—where the economy will be and what may affect it negatively. MS. JOHNSON.  Well, again, over a longer period, I think we face a real energy issue as a global economy.  And I find it very hard to believe that energy prices are, in fact, going to be five or six or seven or eight years from now where that far-dated futures price is putting them right now.  But I’m sure they’ll go both up and down in between.  And for the period over which monetary policy is made, I can’t do better than what the markets are seeing.  I am expecting that, over time, the standard of living of many, many, many people on the planet is going to rise.  And I’m assuming that the rise will imply some overall higher consumption of energy per capita and that the higher prices are indeed precisely what we need to stimulate new technologies, to stimulate substitutions in all the right places.  It will be because the economy is growing that prices of energy will go up, not because the economy is somehow going to get in trouble. Other things can also arise.  The political situation in China is by no means guaranteed.  I we’ll have another bad hurricane season.  I just don’t know why people don’t see serial correlation in what’s going on with the hurricanes.  Not only in the Caribbean but around the world, we’re seeing more and more weather-driven phenomena owing to the higher temperature in the oceans and various other things. But I don’t see endogenous weaknesses.  I think the global economy in a very fundamental sense actually has balanced risks—many of the worst shortcomings in many of the economies with whom we trade, both financially and in real goods and services, have been fixed.  I think the conduct of policy is better, broadly speaking.  I think we could have a very good five years.  I can’t put my finger on anything that in the next five years is inevitably bound to cause us a problem.  But I think that over some long period, as more and more people have higher standards of living, we are going to have a big change in relative prices.  And some economies are going to do a better job of absorbing those relative prices than others.  But the U.S. economy might do one of the best jobs in absorbing those relative price changes. MR. STOCKTON.  For my part, the most salient risk that I would note is housing, for a few reasons.  One, it’s an asset market as well as a natural investment, and I just don’t know how to forecast those prices.  I think that, in our presentation last June, we made pretty clear just what the uncertainties are there.  Beyond that, I’m not sure what the effects will be if, in fact, there is a correction either on the construction side or on the price side.  There are just so many uncertainties.  As we’ve noted in the past, we use a standard wealth effect to calculate the consequences of that.  But there could be bigger effects associated with equity extraction.  There also could be confidence effects that are difficult to gauge.  And so I see big risks on both sides.  Obviously, I’d be more worried about the downside risk than the upside risk if we get another couple of years of things going on as they have been going.  It means that for a while you’ll have to lean a little harder against the strength in housing, but it also means you’ll be dealing with potentially bigger consequences when the correction in housing markets occurs. So looking at the data, I’m feeling comfortable with our basic forecast—that things are tipping down.  But as I indicated, we’re just really not sure what it’s unwinding to—whether it’s unwinding to the sort of benign soft landing that we’re forecasting.  We think that forecast is reasonable.  There’s nothing in the rate environment or in other factors that makes the forecast look far-fetched to us.  On the other hand, one could certainly envision a more painful and bumpier adjustment that will cause bigger problems for the Committee. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  All right.  We come to the first go-round.  Let me remind you that we’re going to focus in the first round on the economic outlook and will leave, I hope, the policy discussion until tomorrow.   As you know, there has been interest in increasing the interaction in this round, so I have a few suggestions.  First, I will take the liberty of intervening occasionally and raising a question or asking for comment.  Second, and this is the risky thing, we’re going to allow two-handed interventions.  [Laughter]  If you would like to comment or ask a question about a colleague’s remarks, please raise two hands, and you’ll be recognized to make short remarks to be perhaps responded to.  This process may work too well.  [Laughter]  Therefore, I reserve the right to play traffic cop, and we’ll take the whole thing as an experiment and see how it goes.  Who would like to go first?  [Laughter]  President Moskow.   MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you.  President Guinea Pig right here.  [Laughter]  The two hands are for comments? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Immediate recognition. MR. MOSKOW.  And one hand is just for recognition. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  For your turn in the round. MR. MOSKOW.  Okay.  No clarification questions.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If you would like to be recognized immediately out of turn, raise two hands; otherwise, one hand. MR. MOSKOW.  Okay.  Well, most of my contacts this time were upbeat about current conditions.  Though the Midwest continues to underperform the rest of the nation, the U.S. economy seems to remain on solid footing.  So we tried to assess whether the strength in January and February was just a transitory bounceback from the fourth quarter or whether it represents some persistent forward momentum.  And while a few contacts expressed concerns about higher energy prices and softening housing markets—as we were just discussing—most pointed to an economy with substantial staying power.  A bit of good news is that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which will be released on Friday, will show a significant increase—from 54.9 to 60.4. The persistent momentum in the economy appears to be creating some pressure on resources.  One example is the airline industry.  Business and leisure travel are at very high levels, with strong bookings for the past few months.  Load factors are at near-record highs, in part reflecting a reduced capacity in the industry.  There continue to be more reports of fare increases, and surprisingly the increases are now being led by the low-cost carriers. We’re hearing about tightening labor markets.  Manufacturers continue to have difficulty finding skilled workers.  In the temporary-help area, Manpower—headquartered in our District—said that wage growth is accelerating nationally.  Three months ago wages were basically flat on a year-over-year basis.  Now they’re expecting increases of 4 to 5 percent in the second quarter of this year.  Kelly Services, also headquartered in our District, reported steady nationwide increases in the 3 percent to 4 percent range.  But both companies noted that labor markets were still nowhere near as tight as they were in the late ’90s. Speaking of labor markets, to update the GM–Delphi–UAW saga, Rick Wagoner, General Motors’ CEO, thinks that the GM buyout plan will take the heat off the poor Delphi–UAW relations, lessening the chance of a strike there.  He expects a significant number of GM and Delphi workers to sign up for the plan.  This will allow them to reduce the size of their workforce more quickly.  One aspect of this agreement that parties are not publicizing widely, for obvious reasons, is that GM and Delphi should have more flexibility in hiring temporary workers and outsourcing in the future.  The temporary workers will have lower wages, and they won’t have the full GM benefit package. Turning to the outlook, I feel that the near-term risks to the forecast have changed somewhat since our last meeting.  On the growth front, I had previously thought that high energy prices and sticker shock from heating bills might damp spending substantially.  And on the price front, I was concerned that pass-through of higher energy prices and other costs could boost core inflation and feed through to inflation expectations.  Neither risk has materialized so far.  Private domestic demand appears to be growing at a solid pace.  The recent price news has been favorable, and inflation expectations have moved little. So what are the risks now?  I do not see many immediate downside risks to growth; to the contrary, I personally think that the risk may have tilted to the upside.  It’s true that housing appears to be moderating, but the softening seems to be happening much as we expected it to.  In contrast, consumption growth continues to be quite strong.  This may be a signal that households are more confident about their permanent income prospects, perhaps because of healthy labor markets and the strong underlying productivity growth.  If so, then we could be in for some continued robust consumer spending.  In addition, growth abroad has improved.  Notably, Japan and Europe are showing some life.  Thus, we could see more demand emanating from abroad.  So in the short term, growth will likely exceed potential.  But given a funds rate path like that in the Greenbook, which I would characterize as a touch restrictive, my outlook and the Greenbook’s get growth back to potential by 2007.   Despite the recent good readings on inflation, the current strength of the economy is showing through in our simple indicator-based forecasts of inflation.  We run about two dozen forecasting models that encompass common statistical indicators of future inflation.  These are not structural models.  They are simple regression forecasting models that use only current data, and they have no explicit conditioning assumptions regarding future policy, oil prices, or other such factors.  And this contrasts with a more structural methodology like the FRB/US model.  Nearly all of these indicator models predict some uptick in core inflation over the next two years—not a big one but to something a bit above 2 percent in 2007.  Looking ahead, these projections would probably move down with a further string of good news about prices and more-balanced prospects for resource utilization.  Nonetheless, given the models’ forecasts and the fact that we currently are operating with very little resource slack in the economy, I see a risk that inflationary pressures will be somewhat greater than what is currently built into the Greenbook. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you want to comment on the automobile industry in general and the prospects for production and prices? MR. MOSKOW.  Well, I think that, on the production side, the Big Three producers have slowed down somewhat for this quarter and next quarter compared with last year.  I think the sales outlook for the industry is really pretty good.  You know, it’s about 16.5–16.6 million for light vehicles.  And the big issue, of course, is the shift from the Big Three to foreign producers, which is shifting output from the northern part of the Midwest to the southern states.  So that’s the big, big news in our District.  In terms of the contribution to the overall economy, I don’t see any real concerns here in ’06.  On pricing, they say that they are trying to cut back on the discounts that they have been giving, and they have cut back somewhat.  But I think the proof will be in the pudding as we get into this year as to whether they can continue that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  May I say it’s a great pleasure to see you back at the table.  And while I hesitate to wish your predecessor’s eighteen years of service on anyone, I look forward to many interesting and productive meetings under your leadership. The latest monthly data show significant strength in activity for the quarter just ending, and I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that this strength represents a temporary catch-up after the weak fourth quarter.  I anticipate that growth will likely settle back to trend as the year progresses, especially as the lagged effect of tighter financial conditions damps interest-sensitive sectors.  The current risks to this scenario are by now a well-known litany—housing, energy prices, the saving rate, foreign demand, and term premiums.  Overall, I judge the risk to the growth forecast to be pretty well balanced. I did want to comment briefly on the risks associated with housing.  This is the sector that obviously bears close watching because it can represent the leading edge of the effects of the monetary tightening.  Thus far, published data on housing starts and permits provide rather little evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity, although other indicators such as home-buying attitudes and new home sales, along with a growing amount of anecdotal evidence, suggest that tighter financing conditions are finally exacting a toll.  I think one possible reason that starts and permits have remained so strong is that the inventory margin is taking up some of the slack in demand.  Indeed, the stock of unsold homes on the market has now reached quite high levels.   I noted a similar phenomenon in talking to a real estate developer in what has been the sizzling Phoenix housing market.  In that market, demand has been so strong that builders couldn’t build houses fast enough to satisfy buyers.  So delivery times for new homes were very long.  And as the demand for new homes has slowed recently, we haven’t seen a noticeable change in building activity, but there has been a significant decline in delivery times.  As this margin, like unsold inventories, returns to more historical norms, I think that we’ll see the moderation in demand show up in new construction numbers as well. Turning to inflation, I think it’s worth stressing how good recent readings have been.  Over the past twelve months, core PCE prices are up 1.8 percent, the market-based component 1.5 percent, and the core CPI just 2.1 percent.  As I’ve noted in previous meetings over the past six months, we have been more optimistic than the Greenbook about the prospects for core inflation during 2006.  For quite some time now, we have been on the order of several tenths of a percentage point lower.  And I continue to think that core PCE price inflation will come in at about 1.8 percent this year. As the Greenbook forecast drifts down, I think maybe my stubbornness is paying off.  My relative optimism partly reflects my view, based on econometric evidence using data after the early 1980s, that there is little pressure for higher inflation coming from the pass-through of energy prices to labor compensation or core prices.  Another important element in my optimistic inflation outlook is inflation expectations, which I consider to be well contained and unlikely to provide significant upward impetus to inflation.  At the same time, I think it’s important not to ignore the potential adverse inflationary consequences from a resurgent economy. I realize the link between resource utilization and inflation is a contentious topic.  Actually, the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters asked its respondents whether they used the concept of a natural rate of unemployment in their macroeconomic projections, and the replies indicate a split of about 50–50.  About half the economic forecasters, in other words, use such a rate, and the other half don’t.  And my guess is that there is also a considerable difference of opinion around this table.  Personally, I’m persuaded that excess demand in a market does tend to push up prices and that the domestic labor market is no exception to this rule.  I think that the econometric evidence supports that view. President Fisher has been arguing, and perhaps some others would agree, that what matters is not just U.S. productive capacity but worldwide capacity.  I do agree that the world—or, more accurately, the aggregate supply curve—has probably become flatter.  But while globalization has had a profound impact on the U.S. economy in a number of ways, I think that there are a number of reasons to doubt that it will overturn, at least completely, the normal historical relationship between domestic labor market slack and inflation.  The first point here is simply that many goods and most services still must be produced in the United States, and so foreign capacity isn’t an issue.  The second point is that, in order to utilize productive capacity in foreign countries, we do need to run a trade deficit; in principle, such deficits eventually put downward pressure on our exchange rates, which tends to raise the prices paid for imports in the United States.  I’m sure this is a topic we will be discussing in a lot more detail going forward. Of course, the measurement of aggregate excess demand or slack is difficult, and I’m sympathetic to the view that there is no bright red line for the unemployment rate that, once crossed, triggers higher inflation.  But by examining a variety of indicators, I think it’s possible to get a useful notion of aggregate resource utilization.  I would judge that these measures currently fall in a range from a modest amount of slack to a modest amount of excess demand.  Specifically, the unemployment rate, the vacancy rate, the employment–population ratio, capacity utilization, and other measures are all within a few tenths, in unemployment rate terms, of full employment. Looking ahead, with the unemployment rate already at 4.8 percent, I think it’s logical to worry that wage and price inflation will rise over time if resource slack diminishes further.  And with GDP growth forecast at 3¾ percent this year, a naïve calculation based on Okun’s law suggests that the unemployment rate could fall to 4½ percent by the fourth quarter.  In contrast, the Greenbook assumes that the unemployment rate will remain unchanged.  The Greenbook inflation projection is, accordingly, more optimistic than a forecast based on the naïve model. Now, given the importance of the behavior of unemployment to one’s forecast of inflation, my staff has been looking at the performance and fit of Okun’s law—namely, the relationship between output growth and the change in the unemployment rate.  And I think their analysis provides support for the Greenbook assessment.  Using a dynamic version of Okun’s law that fits exceptionally well after 1961, my staff finds evidence of an error correction between the output and the unemployment gaps.  During 2005, unemployment declined substantially more than a simple version of Okun’s law would have predicted.  And this dynamic model suggests that, even with fast economic growth, the unemployment rate will likely be pushed up a bit this year, as this unusual So to sum up, I see steady growth and few pressures for price acceleration. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You address this a bit at the end, but how do you reconcile your optimism about core inflation with the view that you have increasing resource utilization and that it affects inflation? MS. YELLEN.  Okay.  I guess my view is that it’s a risk, but at the moment, by various measures, we’re pretty close to, not beyond, full employment.  The unemployment rate has declined unusually rapidly over the last year, but a simple Okun’s law calculation—and I think that the staff has commented on this in the past, if I’m not mistaken—would assess the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate during 2005 as especially large, given what output growth was.  In that sense, the unemployment rate is now giving us a reading of less slack in the economy than we would get from other indicators.  Our forecast is that the mysterious decline in the unemployment rate last year will be reversed so unemployment will hold steady, even with growth at the magnitude that the Greenbook is projecting (around 3¾ percent).  That’s what the error-correction mechanism is about. So I’m optimistic about inflation because I see us ending 2006 at roughly full employment, with the unemployment rate in the vicinity of its current level.  I’m also optimistic about inflation because we’ve been persuaded that since the 1980s we’ve seen very little pass-through of energy-price increases into core inflation.  That has been a source of considerably more optimism on our part than on Greenbook’s part in that it continues to project pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core inflation through 2006. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share the view of most that the slow growth in the fourth quarter of last year was, in fact, a temporary aberration that will be offset by strong first-quarter growth in the neighborhood of 4½ to 5 percent.  Auto sales have already bounced back, and defense spending is unlikely to continue declining.  And business investment spending looks to be strong.  Like most outside forecasters and the Greenbook, our Atlanta BVAR and DSGE models are projecting that GDP growth will be around 3¼ percent or so in the second half of 2006 and into 2007.  Our models also have core PCE inflation holding between 1¾ and 2 percent and the fed funds target rate peaking at about 5 percent. Although I would characterize this outlook as solid, and even encouraging, some significant uncertainties and risks surround the outlook.  I’d like to comment on several of those risks and, in doing so, include some observations from our region’s experience and contacts that seem to be relevant. The first set of uncertainties in my own mind revolves around how the residential real estate adjustment will unfold—something Dave and Janet have already talked about.  Although the there clearly could be a more disruptive set of changes that we do not now foresee.  As I reported at our last meeting, we are now seeing some significant downward price adjustments and cancellation of some major condominium projects in our red-hot, speculation-driven coastal Florida markets.  At the same time, other markets are seeing more-modest adjustments, and it appears that builders are cutting back in response to demand signals.  I don’t mean to imply that a major pullback in real estate would cause a precipitous drop in economic growth—that would be inconsistent with most of our simulations and analyses.  Yet growth in that sector could slow even more than we now expect, especially if mortgage rates should continue to increase.  Adding to the unknowns with regard to residential construction is the timing of the kick that will be associated with Hurricane Katrina rebuilding.  The Greenbook has built in a measurable near-term contribution from that reconstruction, but I continue to believe that we’re going to be surprised at how protracted that rebuilding is going to turn out to be. That brings me to a second concern—our admitted uneasiness with how well we can explain the behavior of long-term interest rates in this cycle, something we talked about earlier but have not done so much recently.  Despite the new academic look that I’m working on, [laughter] I don’t think I can add any genius to the possible explanations already offered by the current and the past Chairmen, Vice Chairman Geithner, and others.  But I was here at the FOMC table for the heyday of the so-called new economy, when we thought for quite a while that we could explain some significantly different behavior, some important elements of our economy, only to learn in hindsight that some of those phenomena turned out to revert to past relationships and past experience.  Clearly, an unexpected uptick in the long-term rates, including mortgage rates, would not come as a complete surprise.  It would affect both household and business spending.  I see it as a risk that we should be careful not to dismiss too quickly. The two uncertainties I’ve just talked about represent downside risks to output.  There’s another development that I think tends to offset those downside worries.  Job growth has been strong; in fact, in our region we are hearing more and more reports of shortages of new workers in a number of industries and with certain job skills.  At the same time, much has been made of stagnant wages for some workers.  My staff has analyzed data on the wages and on the types of jobs being created relative to those being destroyed and has found that, although the wage dynamics did deteriorate between 2001 and 2003, wage relationships have since returned to historical norms.  Moreover, business surveys from both the National Association for Business Economics and the National Federation of Independent Businesses suggest that, although firms put a lid on wage increases during the 2001-04 period, the net projection of firms that are raising wages has become more widespread, and it is now about the same as it was during the 1990s.  This rebound suggests to me that wage growth from net job creation is now lending more support to spending than it has in the recent past, taking some of the pressure off other sources of funding, such as home equity extraction. As our recent post-FOMC meeting statements have indicated, upside inflation risks also remain.  It’s still not clear to me that we’ve seen the full long-term adjustment by households and businesses to elevated energy prices.  I continue to hear reports of more energy and other commodity cost pass-throughs that people would like to make, and reports of rollbacks of earlier energy surcharges are few and far between. Although I’m not a proponent of the NAIRU way of thinking about the relationship between unemployment and expected pressure on inflation—a relationship that is hard to see in any recent empirical data—we do need to watch more carefully than ever for new bottlenecks and price pressures in a solid expansion that is now four years old.  In fact, even though I see that the risk at our current and expected policy setting is getting close to balance, as a good central banker I remain at least a bit more concerned about the potential for inflation to edge somewhat higher.  I will not argue tomorrow for a significantly tighter policy to help push the inflation rate moderately down, within the range most of us have said we view as our objective.  But I do not think we want to risk a higher level of inflation at this point and risk having inflation expectations begin to deteriorate. I believe the kinds of uncertainty that I’ve just talked about demonstrate that our reading on the path of policy and the proper policy setting over the period ahead has become more difficult to get just right and more difficult to explain.  And I think that suggesting that future policy action will be determined by the evolution of the economic outlook lends credence to the spirit of the recent post-meeting statements.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker had a comment. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I apologize.  I haven’t learned the gestures yet.  [Laughter]  I didn’t practice them before the meeting.  President Yellen, I wanted to ask you two things, and they’re related in my mind.  What’s your understanding of why the pass-through correlations declined in the mid-1980s?  And second, if the interpretation has to do with policy, to what extent is that empirical and natural rate relationship you were discussing earlier structural?  That is, to what extent do different policy rules affect its slope and position? MS. YELLEN.  Well, I think the econometric evidence suggests that the pass-through has expectations have become better anchored, and market participants have more confidence in the Fed’s commitment to price stability.  And so there are fewer, in effect, inflation scares of the type we had in the ’70s, when inflation expectations became unhinged.  In that sense, of course, it is contingent on policy.  I think policy has also been more consistently responsive to movements in inflation—not only in the sense of having become more creative but also in the sense of systematically raising the real federal funds rate in response to an increase in inflation, which wasn’t always the case previously. MR. LACKER.  I agree with everything you’ve said.  That’s my hunch about why that pass-through correlation fell as well.  But then, in principle, shouldn’t an improvement in expectations about policy have the capacity to make that relationship between resource utilization and nominal inflation relatively flat? MS. YELLEN.  It certainly could. MR. LACKER.  Okay. MS. YELLEN.  That could be one of the drivers.  Sure, I agree with that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Guynn, I wonder if you would say a little more about the Katrina rebuilding—why you think that’s going to be very slow. MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, the more times we visit there—we’re going to take our full board down in May—and the more people we talk to, our sense is how dysfunctional that whole area still is.  The state government still hasn’t got its act together.  You may have read that the going to get either state government or local government operating, especially with the new hurricane season coming up.  Everything we see and hear from the field suggests that, until people come to grips with what the new flood-plain maps look like and what the building codes need to look like, there will be very little real construction going on.  It’s still mostly cleanup.  And although we’re getting some construction in Mississippi, where they seem to be further along, the bigger area that is yet to come is in New Orleans.  It looks like a ten-year proposition rather than a two- or three-year proposition.  And I can’t work any better numbers than the staff did here, but I suspect it’s going to be strung out over a really long time. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. MS. MINEHAN.  I notice that you are without a Hawaiian shirt. [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Next meeting. MS. MINEHAN.  Next meeting, okay.  [Laughter]  We’ve had a wide range of contacts in New England since our last meeting, so what I’m going to do is try to summarize five or six different things that came out as a result of this range of contacts. The first point is basically driven by the data.  New England continues to grow more slowly than the nation.  Actually, employment growth year over year is about a third of the pace of the nation as a whole—sort of normal, in a way.  New England tends to have a slower-growing population and labor force than the rest of the nation.  But the recent pace of job growth is decidedly slower than the long-run average.  Nonetheless, regional businesses seem to be broadly participating in the growth of the overall economy, and even the pace of losses in manufacturing jobs seems to be slowing.  Indeed, merchandise exports for the region were quite strong despite continuing manufacturing job losses, suggesting that regional manufacturers have figured out a way to enjoy some productivity growth and to keep their output relatively high. Almost all contacts have been quite upbeat about sales and revenue expectations for this year.  Most state corporate tax collections have been booming, and retail sales and state sales tax revenues are at or above budget almost everywhere except Rhode Island.  Rhode Island seems to be going through a kind of flattening of growth.  I’m not exactly sure why. At a recent conference of regionwide Realtors, optimism was expressed by heads of state Realtor groups that, so far, home sales and prices, although they are certainly moderating, have held up fairly well.  And that’s even considering the fact that in the fourth quarter of last year, sales in the Northeast, unlike for the nation, declined for both new and existing homes.  But ’06 was viewed by this group as proceeding fairly well. There is some evidence of tight labor markets for certain skilled jobs.  We have in one of our advisory groups a CEO of a software firm that does software and consulting services oriented toward recruitment for Global 2000 customers.  She reported that their clients around the world are having difficulty hiring health care, technology, finance, and professional-level sales personnel.  So she was seeing some real uptick in labor market tightness at the high end. And I must say that when you look at commercial vacancy rates, which have declined for Class A downtown and suburban space, not just in Boston but elsewhere, you seem to get the impression that maybe businesses haven’t started to hire yet but they do have plans to hire and they do have plans to hire at the high end. Finally, local measures of price growth remain quite contained, though headline CPI data indicate that the region has suffered more than the nation from high energy and utility costs, even with the quite mild winter. In assessing the reaction of contacts about cost increases, we heard a bit less complaining this time around.  Maybe people have just given up complaining, or perhaps they have found ways—and I think this is probably more true than not—to offset high commodity and energy costs through rising productivity. The picture for the nation is even better than it is for New England.  We, like the Greenbook authors, have been a bit surprised and pleased at the strength of the incoming data after the bump in the fourth quarter.  David mentioned all the good reasons to be pleased—strong employment, solid consumer spending, not much evidence yet of a large drag from housing, solid business investment and production, very favorable financing conditions, faster growth than the rest of the world, and through it all, moderating headline and rather flat core inflation, whether you look at the CPI or the PCE, reflecting a leveling-out of energy prices and continued strong productivity growth.  True, some luck has been involved, particularly the rather temperate winter weather in the Northeast, with its good news for overall energy and electricity costs.  And the drop in new home sales may be a harbinger of worse to come.  But the first quarter is over, and it was stronger than we expected, even allowing for a bounceback from Q4. Looking ahead, we agree with the general trajectory of the Greenbook forecast, as we have for some time.  However, we have penciled in a somewhat greater effect in ’06 on growth from the expected falloff in housing—that is, an actual small decline in residential investment in every quarter this year and a related effect on consumption from a flattening of the growth in household wealth.  So our GDP forecast for ’06 is somewhere between three- and four-tenths lower than the Greenbook’s, though ’07 is just about the same. We also see a smaller uptick in core inflation this year, largely because we see labor markets as having a bit more capacity than does the Greenbook, which we believe accounts for some of the moderation in wage and salary growth, at least by some measures.  It may be splitting hairs to mention what in the end are small differences between Boston’s forecast and the Greenbook’s.  After all, we don’t have the same number of resources in Boston focusing on making a forecast as you do here for the Greenbook.  But I think we are at a point where small differences in outlook really do affect how each of us sees the policy choices. Now, what are the risks around this benign, if not rosy, outlook?  Will they continue to revolve around growth that is higher than expected, prompted by a continuation of consumer strength—if, for example, housing takes less of a bite out of growth than we expect—and by financial conditions that could remain more stimulative as well?  Indeed, when we look both at where we’ve been off in evaluating the outlook over the past couple of years and at our own Boston forecast, the surprises have mostly been the result of rising household wealth and a related set of very favorable financial market conditions.  If these conditions continue, greater inflationary pressure than we expect could well result, given where we are in terms of resource utilization.  And of course, new energy shocks are possible, given the possible geopolitical unrest and tight supply conditions.  Alternatively, looking at risks on the other side, a greater-than-expected slowdown in housing, with a related larger pickup in saving rates, could put an unexpected damper on growth.  Absent new energy shocks, this would act to moderate both growth and inflationary pressures more than expected.  So we see housing as integral to both upside risks and downside risks. As I see it right now, the risks to the forecast appear relatively well balanced, maybe a touch to the side of inflation.  That’s mostly because we’ve had a lot of recent experiences with surprises on the upside relative to growth, with rising energy and commodity prices, and overall resource capacity is hard to be very precise about.  However, I really don’t see large upside inflation risks, mostly because of what we’ve seen in terms of ongoing productivity growth.  It remains solid, and it continues to act as a powerful buffer.  Indeed, despite the temporary drop-off in Q4, I have not seen or heard anything from my contacts that suggests the underlying business drive to be ever more productive will slow, or slow anytime soon.  So although my assessment of risks has a small upside tilt and I am concerned about how expensive being very wrong on the inflation side would be, I don’t see the situation as significantly unbalanced. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let me just highlight a theme that President Guynn and President Minehan both mentioned, which is that some of the tightest labor market conditions are for the most skilled workers.  It seems to me that normally in a business-cycle expansion the lower-skilled workers tend to benefit at least as much as highly skilled workers.  And I just want to raise this theme for the research people and for the other principals, to see if something is unusual here or if we’re just misinterpreting what is going on. MS. MINEHAN.  I don’t think we’re misinterpreting it.  I think that’s what’s going on. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, like the others, I am grateful to be here under your chairmanship and also to be with the two new Governors who are on board.  I will spare you Texas hyperbole, with the exception of just saying that our District is growing faster than the nation and is pumping on all cylinders.  And I’m going to focus my comments on the CEOs and CFOs to whom I’ve talked, who have national and international franchises, as I am wont to do at these meetings.  The situation is best summarized by one who said, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is.”  What he’s saying and what I’m hearing from almost every CEO and CFO I spoke to, from large and small companies, with the exception of the housing companies, is that they see surprising economic strength and no pricing power despite significant cost pressures.  And that strength is being projected not just into the current quarter but also into the second quarter. So let me start with the railroads, with Burlington Northern.  They reported that last week they shipped more units than in all but ten weeks of 2005.  And they have internally raised their forecast for shipments of consumer goods year over year for the second and third quarters, from 6 percent to 7 percent.  To quote their CEO, “It’s just blowing and going.” UPS, which is not in our District but I talk to them a great deal, reports a 6 percent volume growth based on last week’s numbers.  It’s consistent with what they expect for the first quarter, which is a number greater than 5 percent.  And, again, to use a direct quote, “I just do not see people pulling back.” On the retail front, to get to some of Dave Stockton’s points, the retailers at all price points are reporting that demand is strong and that “the tone of business is beating our expectations.”  Wal-Mart and their brethren point out that a slowdown would manifest itself in a shift of disposable income to food purchases.  They are not seeing that.  To quote the CEO of that very large retailer, “We thought that there would be a drag from $2.50 gasoline, but it’s not happening.”  They expect 4 to 6 percent comps in April.  By the way, assisted by the late date of Easter, a lot is being shoved into March and then some is being carried through into April.  The person I talk to there is the CEO of their U.S. operations, who is not given to overstatement.  I had never before heard him say that  “demand is amazing,” but that’s what he said in our interaction this week.  At a higher price point, we talked to, for example, the CEO of JCPenney.  He said, “We would expect to be running double-digit declines at this point, but we are seeing positive numbers with great strength in the Southeast, the South Central, the West, and also, by the way, the Northeast, which is overcoming weakness in the Central and Midwest geographic areas.” At the last FOMC meeting, I reported concerns of a major manufacturer of drinks, juices, food products, and snacks, based on the gloominess of what he heard at the grocers’ convention in Phoenix.  He now reports that they are less worried and that their concerns have lifted.  And this CEO, whom I would put, Mr. Chairman—using a Winnie-the-Pooh analogy—in the Eeyore category, always sees the glass less than half full.  [Laughter]  Maybe because he’s in the drinks business, I’m not sure.  [Laughter]  He described the economy as “ticking along” and added that, as I quoted earlier, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is.” Kimberly-Clark, another interesting company, which is quite open with us, is a supplier in a different sector of the market.  They report that “despite everything the consumer has been hit with, demand continues to chug along.”   As for the semiconductor companies, Texas Instruments has a book-to-bill ratio right now of 1.11.  That is, orders are coming in 11 percent faster than they’re going out.  In the semiconductor industry, a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 is considered strong.  And they are presently front-loading their capital expenditures from the third quarter into the current quarter in order to meet demand. The other Eeyore to whom I talk suffers from a genetic challenge to being optimistic—he’s a Norwegian.  [Laughter]  He also happens to be one of the larger ship operators in the world, about whom I have reported at previous meetings in terms of the imbalance of supply that’s coming on stream and the demand for that supply.  He reports that “there is much more demand growth than expected.”  And you see that growth reflected in the large bulk carriers, the Panamax carriers, which are the most liquid part of the market, where prices, as I reported last time, had gotten down to $14,000 for a daily rate and are now back up to $17,000.  The container fleet is also holding up, with some change of utilization from the transatlantic shipment to the transpacific shipment.  But as he says, “These markets have legs.”  And he characterized the overall sense of the economy with a very Zorba-the-Greek type of summary of events:  “Demand side is stronger; tanker market is holding up; container market growth is strong.  In short, no catastrophe.” On housing, for which you find the most negative outlook, I have just a couple of comments.  I spoke to two of the five largest housing CEOs.  What they and their competitors watch for is the home cancellation rate—that is, when a buyer puts down a minimal amount as downpayment, which is now down to $1,000, on a home and then walks away.  The average home cancellation rate has run about 22 percent in modern history.  Right after September 11, 2001, it spiked to 28 percent.  It is presently running at 32 percent for the national builders.  So, clearly, housing is a not very happy area. Everybody I talked to reports continued emphasis on cost containment and on re-engineering their production functions.  One of the large chemical companies reported that they used $11 gas to fix all their boilers and production facilities:  “Everyone in the chemical industry is wringing everything they can out of overhead and operations.” So I decided to follow that subject further down the supply chain and talked to the CEO of Anadarko, one of the largest natural gas operations, who happens to be on our board.  They, too, are trying to control costs by centralizing their purchase operation.  They purchase about $3 billion a year, and they expect to drive down costs at the same time in order to finance a massive capital expenditure expansion, which you would expect to be driven by the high prices that they experienced recently.  Wal-Mart has put in a massive one-time enhancement of inventory management, which is pinching suppliers but is providing them with significant savings in dollars. All the companies reported continued interest in building their offshore interests—again, to drive down the cost of operation.  And I thought it was interesting that as Mike Duke, the CEO of Wal-Mart International, was leaving India the other day, Michael Dell—a good Texas company, Dell—got off the plane at the same time and announced that they are going to create jobs for 20,000 new employees in India.  One of the largest securities houses reported that they had sent one of their most senior officials four times in the past nine months to India to figure out a way to drive down the analytical costs by having corporate spreadsheets and other things done there before they’re presented to the decisionmakers for their buy-side analysis and their sales-side analysis.  The CEO of Kimberly-Clark gave me a remarkable number.  He had just come back from India.  They are looking to fill 9,000 jobs.  They received 1.4 million resumés in English.  A Dallas director who is a venture capitalist reported that they will no longer consider providing capital in a second-round venture capital financing unless the company has a foreign component for offsetting costs.  Finally, one of our directors in El Paso, a woman who manufactures accessories in Mexico, has decided to move her Mexican operations to inland China to save on costs.  My point is that this appears to be now part of our corporate DNA in terms of trying to drive down or contain costs.  Again, as the CEO of Wal-Mart said, “This is not just an issue of low labor costs.  It’s an issue of effecting enhanced profitability.” I want to end with a comment of concern in terms of my own District, with regard to construction.  If you look out the window of our offices in Dallas, you’ll see twelve gigantic building cranes.  It almost looks like Shanghai, and this is old downtown Dallas.  And I’m reminded of the comment that was made by one of my predecessors, Bob Boykin, at this table when he was bragging about the fact that Caroline Hunt, in building a project and a hotel—where you’re going to stay when you visit our District—had managed to dig the largest hole ever dug in history.  And your predecessor, Mr. Volcker, said, “Are you speaking figuratively or literally?”  [Laughter]  I don’t know where this will lead, Mr. Chairman.  I do sense that, on the anecdotal side, final demand is much stronger than the econometrics would tell us.  My gut tells me it will end in tears, but we’ll talk about that tomorrow. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Speaking of the largest hole ever dug in history, I wonder if you would have a view on the current account implications of some of this offshoring that you’ve been talking about.  Are you concerned about that? MR. FISHER.  I am concerned.  I worry particularly because I think—and I’d have to get the numbers, but I’m virtually certain—that the shift is taking place particularly in currencies that don’t adjust to the dollar.  India has just announced that they would open the rupee and open their capital account.  The Chinese clearly do not have a free-trading currency. And at the same time, just to show my bias—Janet is going to be very disappointed in me, I think—I subscribe to Winston Churchill’s approach to trade, which is if someone else—I won’t use his exact vernacular—wants to take advantage of their taxpayers and subsidize their production and provide it cheaply for us, we should take it, add value, and capture the majority of the profits.  So I think we are doing that.  I think there are limits as to how far we can run on the current account deficit.  I also expect that eventually the market will correct for that.  But we’ve been talking about that for a great deal of time.  Last year, we worried about the dollar’s strengthening rather than weakening.  And I subscribe in part to what President Poole argues:  The question is how long you continue to attract capital.   Just one more comment on that front, and this is why I asked the question about the Polish zloty and the New Zealand dollar.  One of the things I am concerned about, Mr. Chairman, is that my investment instincts tell me, as we raise rates here and as the yield curve perhaps shifts upward—and perhaps someday at the longer end of the yield curve—that there will indeed be a greater desire to invest in high-quality, risk-free credit like that of the United States and to withdraw capital from some of these lesser, marginal credits.  So there might actually be a short-term effect by which we are encouraged and emboldened by greater capital influence rather than lesser capital influence.  My overall instinct is that we’re postponing the pain and the correction and it’s further out there.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  We have a timing decision to make.  We could take a break now and come back.  I’d like to propose that we stay in the meeting until 6:00 and, at that point, go to a reception and dinner.  We will probably not finish this round by 6:00, but there will be plenty of time tomorrow to do that and time to reflect.  Is that acceptable to everyone, to just stay in the meeting?  All right.  Well, let’s continue then.  The next person is President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I see little in the latest information on the District economy or data on the national economy that gives me undue concern about prospects for sustained economic growth.  Turning first to the District—as is frequently the case, overall it is performing much like the national economy.  The expansion is broadly based, employment is growing, while the usual labor market churning continues.  Sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and energy are particularly strong at this point.  Some job skills, particularly in health care, accounting and auditing, technology, and the energy sector, are in short supply.  Consumer spending overall is well maintained, and nonresidential construction activity appears to be improving.  Housing activity is a little more difficult to summarize.  Construction remains strong; sales are still relatively substantial, as best I can determine; and inventories of unsold properties are rising as well.   Turning to the national economy, I said earlier I wasn’t particularly concerned about the outlook, but I really should put it more positively.  It seems to me that the current state of the national economy and its prospects are both quite good at this point, consistent with growth this year of 3½ percent or perhaps even more.  I’m impressed by the employment gains that we’ve seen, sustained income gains, and so on, and remind myself and others that, as the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated, the economy is certainly capable of long periods of uninterrupted expansion. I thought I would comment a bit more on two issues in particular—one is housing—where I wonder if the significance of potential developments might not be being exaggerated a bit.  I certainly agree that changes in housing prices, up or down, feed into household wealth and through that into consumer spending.  I think that’s a perfectly acceptable story.  So if housing prices go down or level off, they will have that effect on wealth and potentially on spending.  But there seems to be a view that, in some sense, an exogenous pronounced decline in housing prices is possible, quibble with that story, but I would wonder about its likelihood because it seems to me more likely that housing is the tail rather than the dog in this.  That is, as long as employment continues to go up, incomes continue to go up, and mortgage rates remain relatively moderate, then I would expect that we would avoid severe difficulties in housing except for a few markets that are particularly inflated at this point.  Putting it the other way around, only if overall economic conditions deteriorate, with employment declining and income growth slowing or declining and so forth, would I expect there to be more broadly based and more-severe problems in housing. The second issue I’d like to spend a little time on is the inflation outlook.  The question I asked myself is, How likely is an appreciable acceleration of inflation at this point, particularly in light of the steps we have taken to get the federal funds rate back to a reasonable range?  First, I would argue that inflation expectations remain very well anchored at this point.  I don’t hear, as I go around and talk to various groups and meet with various business people, any doubt among the participants about the Fed’s ongoing commitment to low inflation.  And I think most of the available data support that.  One of the things I was looking at was a chart of one-, five-, and ten-year rates of core PCE inflation.  And when you look at that, you see that the ten-year rate of inflation has been declining steadily and now is a little below 2 percent.  The five-year rate has basically the same pattern.  It leveled off in about 2000, but it, too, is a little below 2 percent.  And, of course, the one-year rate of inflation, although it bounces around a lot more, ends up at about the same place, also a little below 2 percent.  And I just don’t have a sense that there has been any unhinging of inflationary expectations at this point. Another topic that I would comment on only briefly is the issue of lags in policy.  That is, presumably the full effects of the actions we’ve already taken have not yet been felt.   Finally, we have looked at some forecasting equations that try to incorporate the growth in the money supply in particular and to forecast core PCE inflation.  I wouldn’t claim a lot for the quality of these equations.  I wish I could, but I can’t.  But for the most part, these various equations provide forecasts that are very close to the Greenbook forecast.  Inflation might be a little lower this year or might be a little higher this year, but they show very small changes for the most part.  My view is that the Greenbook inflation forecast is a pretty good one.  Like President Yellen, I originally submitted a number of 1.8 percent for inflation this year, and I don’t see any reason to change it at this point.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The momentum in the Fourth District economy appears to be broadly similar to the rest of the country’s.  The region appears to be expanding at a good but not spectacular pace.  Although my District never experienced the extreme acceleration in housing activity seen in many other parts of the country, we are nonetheless seeing some downturn in residential activity relative to last year.  And, of course, we are being affected by the shifting fortunes in the auto industry.  The further we move into the year, the more optimistic business people seem to be about the outlook.  The softness in last year’s fourth quarter is now all but forgotten.  Business leaders in the District are sticking with strong capital spending plans, and I’ve been getting especially positive reports on commercial construction. Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook baseline captures the broad contours of my own expectations—namely, a slowing in personal consumption spending and, as many others have commented, in the housing sector over the course of the year, leading the overall economy back toward a moderating but solid growth path next year. As for the outlook on prices, I am still predicting that headline inflation will shift down this year from last year’s energy-shocked pace and move much closer to the center of my preference range.  Overall, I really am not seeing a lot in the way of warning signs that inflationary pressures are building.  I get sporadic reports of labor market tightness, a point to which I’ll return in a minute.  But I hear just as many reports highlighting the moderation of energy costs, especially for natural gas.  The headline and ex-food and energy CPI inflation for February were quite favorable and were certainly interpreted as such by financial markets.  And, importantly, inflation expectations do appear to be well contained.  Like others, in Cleveland we typically monitor the ten-year TIPS spreads, and those certainly have not been giving me any cause for alarm.  Despite this, I get a sense from business contacts that the full pass-through of energy and material costs into final goods prices Greenbook—some slight tick-up in core inflation this year as a whole, with core measures moving down to more-desirable levels in 2007. As I turn to the risks to the outlook, I try to think of those places where my staff’s analysis or the comments that I hear from my business contacts seem most at odds with the Greenbook projections.  If there is one area of some disagreement, it would be the degree to which the Greenbook seems to emphasize potential increases in labor costs as a source of upward price pressures in the near term.  Consistent with the Greenbook assessment, I am hearing, for the first time in years, reports of some tightening in labor markets and some accelerating wage growth.  However, to echo your theme, Mr. Chairman, the job vacancies and wage pressures do appear to be concentrated in a small number of high-skilled occupations.  My list is very similar to President Minehan’s.  In truth, I have to work pretty hard to get my business contacts to talk about their concerns about accelerating wage costs.  And I fear just a little that my interrogations may be forcing confessions from the innocent.  [Laughter]  At the same time, my business contacts are still optimistic about their ability to generate solid productivity gains.  Although I do expect to see some continued pass-through of previous shocks to core measures of inflation, these influences are expected to dissipate over the course of the year. When I add up all of these pieces, I don’t see much evidence that capacity constraints are likely to drive up price and wage pressures.  What I don’t know, of course, is whether the reports that I’m getting are peculiar to the Fourth District.  When I look at the employment cost data over the past several quarters, they seem consistent with a relatively benign wage cost picture.  But I heard from a few of my colleagues ahead of me that they are seeing a different picture.  I am interested in whether these anecdotal impressions that I’m getting are just a Fourth District peculiarity or whether they’re spread more broadly.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You mentioned nonresidential construction, and President Fisher mentioned that.  I think the Greenbook was pretty pessimistic about the near-term prospects for nonresidential construction.  Is there some dissonance there?  [Laughter] MR. STOCKTON.  Well, in fact, we’re forecasting a recovery.  We’ve been forecasting a recovery for the last year and a half that hasn’t happened yet.  I actually don’t view us as being terribly pessimistic in that regard.  We’re forecasting an upturn after a long period of disappointing, sluggish performance on that side.  So I guess I’d characterize our forecast as somewhat optimistic relative to where we’ve been over the past two years. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Do you count state and local construction in that?  Does that come in nonresidential or in state and local spending? MR. STOCKTON.  That’s actually in state and local construction spending.  It’s a different component. MS. MINEHAN.  Because that, I would think, has the potential to be pretty strong, given the tax collections and so forth. MR. STOCKTON.  Actually, it has been an area that has improved as well.  So the one part in which we haven’t seen much yet has been the office building side.  And that is an area where our forecasting improved, so I was actually a bit relieved to hear of some cranes out there. [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  I was just going to add to that, David.  For so many months I was hearing about some increased construction in health care facilities and school buildings.  But in the past few months it has been broader than that—it has been office buildings and some plants. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, in terms of what we see outside our window at our Federal Reserve Bank, it is almost all condominium construction.  The joke is that you want to be the fourth owner of the building that is being constructed. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.  MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A couple of things, first, on the region.  Like the nation, our region continues to grow at a fairly robust pace.  But one of the questions we kept asking in our discussions was whether it was strong but leveling out, or accelerating.  I think, for the most part, the consensus is that it’s strong but leveling out.  Turning to just a couple of examples, manufacturing activity did expand in February and, we think, in March on a preliminary basis, but at a somewhat slower pace than in January and even in December for us.  Production and new orders rose only modestly in the February and early March period.  Housing activity, as others have discussed, has shown some signs of leveling off, although it is still high by historical standards.  Residential construction has edged down in most areas of our District, and builders to whom we’ve talked expect further easing in the months ahead.  I think it is important, too, that home sales are showing little or no growth, with high-end sales softer than most of the other segments in our Just to mention commercial real estate, it has actually improved somewhat in our region.  Vacancy rates have continued to edge down in the Denver and Kansas City areas, so we have seen some pickup in activity.  Energy activity continues to expand very rapidly, despite shortages of labor and equipment throughout the western part of our region.  In some of our Rocky Mountain communities, concern has increased that the energy boom will drive away some of the other core business because of the costs of labor, land, and houses—it is really a boom environment there. I will talk quickly about inflation in our area.  Wage pressures, in fact, remain mostly subdued.  We have seen some backdown in wholesale prices, although retail prices have edged up.  Manufacturers reported to us somewhat slower growth in raw material prices so far this year compared with last year.  However, I would say they are also concerned that they cannot pass price increases on as they work through the process. Let me just say one thing on the auto industry in our region.  I talked with one of the largest retailers-dealers in the region, in Denver—actually, he goes into Texas and some other areas.  He told me that in just the first two weeks of March they’ve seen a general slowdown in some demand for their products, both domestic and foreign.  But he said that, obviously, the domestic market is really suffering greatly.  In fact, he has seen other dealers refuse to take inventory from the domestic auto dealers, which gives him real concern about that industry going forward. Turning quickly to the national outlook, I agree that, for the most part, it is very positive.  I think that in the first quarter, maybe the first half, we will see a strong GDP number, perhaps as high as the Greenbook has indicated or even higher, which will then move back down toward the trend rate of growth over the course of the year.  Like President Stern, I think part of this in the first quarter and first half is reflective of a couple of things.  One is the bounceback from the year-end.  Another is the last effects of accommodative policy that we had in the previous year, because a lot of money is still searching to be deployed right now but is beginning to be used up.  And for the first time in a while, I’ve heard more and more businesses talk about the prime rate.  I haven’t heard that in four years.  They are much more sensitive to it.  They’ve seen it go up, and now they’re negotiating around that, which I think tells you that some of the catch-up in terms of the policy effects of our past moves has begun, and I think you’ll see more of it in the coming months and quarters. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  A number of people have talked about tightening monetary conditions.  President Yellen did.  Of course, long-term rates have not risen, so I guess there is a question here about the issue of how much is the term premium, how much is the change in the equilibrium rate.  I just put that question on the table because your views on it should affect whether you think conditions are essentially easy or tightening.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back.  And welcome to the new Governors.  First, I’d like to make a couple of comments on the region before I talk about the national economy.  The Third District didn’t see a fourth quarter as weak as the national economy, nor is our first quarter as strong.  But we’re seeing solid growth, which our indicators tell us will continue at current rates for the foreseeable future. Payroll employment is a particular issue in our District.  With the benchmark revisions that were made, our employment growth has been stronger than we originally estimated.  Our three-state unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in January, and businesses report an increasingly difficult time finding qualified workers.  Indeed, more than half the respondents to a special question on our manufacturing survey said that they were having trouble filling openings because of the lack of qualified applicants.  That’s an increase from 40 percent when we asked that question two years ago.  Firms report the greatest difficulty in finding production workers and computer-savvy employees, but I would go on to point out that one of our directors, who heads a temporary employment agency, has been reporting for the past two years a continuing difficulty in finding workers with even limited skills to deploy. Manufacturing in our area continues to expand at a moderate pace.  After a temporary dip in level is consistent with moderate expansion in activity. Retail sales in our District are rising only modestly, but retailers tell us that weaknesses in office space in the District is growing, and that’s unusual for our market.  The office market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and the office vacancy rate is which is the first office building we’ve had in downtown Philadelphia in a decade.  We are seeing a few signs of modest slowdown in housing markets, with permits, home sales, and mortgage lending softening in recent months. Finally, we have received some further welcome news of moderation in price pressures in the District.  Our manufacturers’ survey measures of prices received and prices paid have fallen sharply over the past two months.  Expectations of future price increases remain subdued, and several respondents told us that, in their view, input price pressures have settled down and that their inflation concerns have subsided. Turning to the national economy, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline.  All signs point to a strong rebound of growth this quarter, after the temporary weakness in the fourth quarter.  Employment, business spending, and manufacturing remain strong, and consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace.  There are emerging signs that the housing market is beginning to cool off, but no signs of a sharp retrenchment at this point.  The economic fundamentals remain solid, and after the rebound this quarter, we expect growth to settle down to a range of 3 percent to 3½ percent, near potential growth.  The economy is expected to remain near full employment, with labor markets tight.  We expect hourly compensation growth to accelerate somewhat over the forecast period, but not dramatically. Now, in my view, the risks to growth are roughly balanced.  A sharper decline in the housing market than that built into our forecast poses some downside risk, but it’s also possible that housing will not turn down as much as or as soon as forecasted.  The extent to which we see an improvement or further deterioration in exports is another risk that could go either way.  In fact, there appears to be a considerable divergence of views on the path of net exports among private-sector forecasters.   In my view, the inflation risks are tilted somewhat to the upside.  It’s true that the data on core inflation and inflation expectations and our own recent decline in survey measures of prices paid and received are encouraging.  The acceleration of core inflation at the end of 2005 has been reversed in the first months of 2006.  So far, firms have had a remarkable ability to absorb cost shocks via new-found productivity gains, and increased global competition has limited their pricing power.  Both have helped keep inflation in check.  On the other hand, oil prices remain at high levels and continue to be volatile.  The ability of firms to maintain low pass-through in the presence of continued higher costs is a question.  With inflation running near the top of the range that I consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of resource utilization, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge.  Several times in the past we have seen core inflation quickly rise by a sizable amount when the economy was operating at high levels of resource utilization following periods of accommodative monetary policy, even when oil prices did not rise sharply.  So in my view, the inflation risks remain at least moderately on the upside, even though the recent data have been benign.  That said, on the whole I think the economy and the economic outlook are very positive.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.  MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While we had some softer readings on our District’s economic performance early in the year, recent measures have been noticeably stronger.  Our survey results from March have come in since the Beige Book, and they show continued strength in service-sector revenue growth, along with a sharp rebound in shipments, new orders, and employment for the manufacturing sector.  The retail sector, in contrast, has been weaker in extraordinary sales growth they saw in January, and many remain optimistic about sales prospects going forward. Several District businesses we talked to plan to increase investment in the months ahead.  Their plans include not only computers and technology but also factory machinery.  Labor markets in our District seem to be getting tighter.  In January, Districtwide unemployment stood at 4.1 percent, and we hear scattered reports of shortages of skilled workers, as you mentioned earlier, along with some complaints that worker shortages are constraining production.  I had heard occasional references to worker shortages in past months, going back into last year, but this chatter has picked up noticeably in recent weeks.  Not only have the number of reports increased somewhat, but some now come from outside the traditionally strong urban areas.  We’re hearing it now in the manufacturing-dependent Carolinas, for example. Price growth measures moderated in our March survey results.  District businesses report that input price increases slowed, but they continued to express concerns about future cost pressures.  Our respondents also reported slower growth in their output prices, and this was broadly based across all sectors we survey.  In addition, expected price increases for the next six months generally lessened. Our regional economic indicators on production, employment, and price pressures seem broadly consistent with the national picture.  The data point to a strong rebound in GDP growth this quarter, perhaps stronger than had been anticipated by the Greenbook and private forecasters.  While household residential investment is slowing, business investment and spending appear to be strong, suggesting that firms are adding to capacity in anticipation of healthy demand growth.  The prospects for income growth, driven by continued employment gains and respectable growth in compensation, give me some confidence that overall consumer spending should hold up well, even as housing market activity moderates. Inflation has come in a bit lower than expected, and I’m increasingly comfortable with the idea that we’ve gotten beyond the risks to inflation presented by the shock associated with last year’s hurricanes and run-up in energy prices.  Core PCE inflation averaged 2.3 percent from Although market-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations rose briefly last fall, they soon subsided and have remained steady since.  So while I’m not entirely sanguine about the inflation outlook, I think the immediate risk of pass-through has probably passed us by. Looking back over this episode, and how we and many others feared that things might have unfolded, I think it illustrates the challenges we face in trying to understand inflation dynamics.  As energy prices rose sharply last fall after the hurricanes, the fear was that a sustained increase in core inflation and inflation expectations would work its way through the economy in the first half of 2006.  This bulge now appears to have been small and short-lived. A common approach to forecasting the effect of energy-price shocks on core inflation is to rely on relationships estimated over historical periods that include seemingly similar episodes.  Such an exercise implicitly treats the empirical relationship between energy prices and core inflation as structural, as in models in which wages or prices are set in a backward-looking fashion.  But as President Yellen and others have emphasized, this relationship is not stable in the historical data.  It has largely disappeared since the late 1980s.  This underscores the pitfalls of forecasting inflation based on a backward-looking approach that relies on pass-through correlations or, for that matter, Phillips curve correlations between measures of slack and inflation.  In contrast, to the extent that price-setting is forward looking, these correlations must embed expectations regarding our policy behavior and so will not generally be stable across changing policy regimes. This perspective suggests that the limited magnitude of the pass-through from last fall’s energy-price shocks was influenced by the public’s confidence that we would focus on preventing broader inflationary spillovers.  In other words, we may have gotten less pass-through than we feared because we were more credible than we realized, and the public’s behavior was more forward looking than we thought. Again, this is not to say that I’m complacent about inflation.  The initial response to last fall’s shocks embodied expectations of a lower path for the funds rate and a greater rise in inflation.  Fortunately, the combination of communication by FOMC participants and the Committee’s steady actions appears to have brought these expectations back in line. I bring all of this up because in the months ahead we are likely to see tighter resource utilization if the Greenbook is correct, and we will be concerned about the extent to which that would put upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.  So the question of the extent to which inflation dynamics are backward looking or forward looking is going to be front and center for us. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And yet our behavior has to be consistent with the model, right?  We have to respond in a way that does, in fact, react to inflationary pressures. MR. LACKER.  That’s right.  It’s just that I’m always struck in episodes like this at the difficulty of taking advantage of historical correlations without taking a strong stand on how the public expects us to conduct policy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’ll agree.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like all of you, we think the underlying trajectory of demand and inflation seems quite favorable, perhaps a bit more so than it did in January.  We expect real GDP to grow at a rate slightly above the rate of increasing potential in ’06 and to slow to the range of potential in ’07.  We expect the core PCE to rise at a rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent over the forecast period.  Differences between our forecast and the Greenbook’s are minor.  In our forecast, we assume that inflation expectations remain anchored and the term premium remains low and that we are now at a point where little or no resource slack is left in the domestic economy. The monetary policy assumption we adopt is the path currently priced into the futures see accompanying any slowdown of housing, the flexibility of profit margins, and the sustainability of this present configuration of low risk premiums.  We view the risk to the growth forecast as roughly balanced, although the usual suspects provide a source of concern.  The risk to our inflation forecast, in contrast, still seems slightly tilted to the upside.   On the growth front, as I said, we think the underlying pace of demand growth is pretty strong, and we don’t see any signs yet that would point to evidence of a significant slowdown relative to potential in prospect.  We think productivity growth is likely to remain quite high, rising perhaps a bit faster this year than in ’05.  With the labor market growing on trend and some increase in labor’s share of national income, we expect consumption growth to remain reasonably strong.  Stronger income growth offsets the expected deceleration in housing-price appreciation and the effect that might have on consumption.  We expect a slight increase in the contribution of business fixed investment to demand growth, due principally to a rise in spending on equipment and software.  We expect, of course, the contribution of residential investment to slow with the forecast period.  World GDP growth seems stronger and more broadly based.  We expect net exports to be a persistent drag, shaving about ½ percentage point off growth for each of the next two years. Despite this forecast of pretty strong spending growth and high levels of resource utilization, we believe core inflation is likely to remain moderate.  Under the assumption of a relatively stable dollar and with the energy-price assumption taken from the futures curve, we expect headline inflation to slow to a rate closer to the core over the forecast period.  But this forecast rests on three important foundations.  The first is that we succeed in keeping inflation expectations reasonably well anchored.  The second is that demand growth not only does not accelerate to a rate substantially above trend but also slows to potential over the forecast period.  And the third is that the expected rise in compensation and unit labor costs results in a rise in labor share of income—in other words, that compensation growth accelerates but the increase is absorbed by some compression of profit margins and does not lead to a significant acceleration in core inflation. Now, the sources of potential upside risk to the inflation forecast are several.  One, of course, comes from the interaction between our views about productivity growth, compensation, and profit margins.  If the pace of productivity growth slows significantly relative to our assumption and if, at the same time, conditions in labor markets continue to improve, unit labor costs are then likely to accelerate.  A rise in compensation, however, would not by itself portend a troubling increase in core inflation.  The extent of this risk, as I said, depends on the degree to which rising unit labor costs are absorbed in shrinking profit margins rather than triggering output price increases as firms attempt to defend existing margins.  And because the labor share of income seems somewhat low and, as historical averages suggest, there’s room for unit labor cost growth to be absorbed in profit margins rather than causing price increases, we need to be attentive to the risk that this process may produce a short-term increase in core inflation, perhaps also in inflation expectations. A second potential risk comes from what we think we know about the pace of demand relative to potential supply globally.  A continued increase in commodity prices around the globe and, more recently, some modest increase in capital goods prices may suggest that global pressures on resource constraints are pushing up prices.  This raises the risk that the recent weakness in core goods prices in the United States may not be sustained.  Service price inflation in the United States has shown signs of slowing. Our central forecast, as I said, is conditioned on little movement in the dollar over the forecast period, but any sizable depreciation of the dollar would still carry the risk of some acceleration in core goods prices. For nearly two years, overall inflation, as what is measured by the PCE or the CPI would suggest, has been running substantially above core, and this is true for a range of alternative measures of underlying inflation.  If the underlying inflation rate were closer to 1.5 percent than to 2 percent, we might view these potential sources of upward pressure with more equanimity.  Although the probability seems low that these forces will act to produce a significant acceleration of core inflation or a significant deterioration in inflation expectations, we need to be careful about those risks.  So with underlying inflation at the upper end of the inferred inflation preference of the Committee, we need to be more attentive to these risks. On the growth side, the most obvious sources of downside risk to growth are a substantial rise in energy prices from current levels, a slowdown in productivity growth, a sharp rise in risk premiums, and a more-adverse effect on saving and consumption from the expected adjustment in housing markets and prices.  Like the staff forecast, we think it’s reasonable to expect household saving to rise a bit and consumption growth to slow, in part because of changing expectations about the pace of future appreciation in the value of home equity.  But we believe that, absent some large, negative shock to perceptions about employment and earned income, the effects of the expected cooling in housing prices are going to be modest.  Of course, this view may prove optimistic.  We take some reassurance from the fact that the average growth forecast in the private sector probably anticipates a significant cooling in housing and a significant effect of that cooling on saving and consumption.   Developments in asset prices and risk premiums over the past several months seem to support this picture of stronger confidence in the growth and inflation outlook because real rates seem to have risen.  Equity prices and credit spreads suggest considerable confidence in the prospect for growth.  Implied volatilities remain quite low.  We don’t know how much of this is fundamental and how much will prove ephemeral.  At the moment, though, overall financial conditions seem pretty supportive of the expansion.   So with this forecast of growth in the vicinity of potential, core inflation at around 2 percent, and the risk somewhat to the upside for inflation, we think the principal responsibility of monetary policy remains to preserve the sense that we will act to keep long-term inflation expectations contained at levels consistent with price stability. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anything to report on co-op prices in Manhattan?  [Laughter]   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  As in many cases, I am not sure what you can take from the anecdote, but I guess some people say that you see a little of the froth dissipating.  But I don’t think the adjustment is acute.  If you see hiring at the New York Fed go up substantially in the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, I agree with many of you around the table and with the Greenbook.  I see that you have solid growth going forward.  I want first to talk about the corporate sector and then to talk a bit about the household sector. I have talked with several corporate CFOs in the past couple of weeks, and I also just received a copy of the Duke quarterly CFO survey.  I found the comments from the CFOs and the survey results to be similar, and so I thought I would just use the Duke survey to make my comments here.  The CFOs are expecting to be able to raise prices more over this coming year than they did last year.  On average, they are expecting an increase in prices of about 3.3 percent.  A year ago at this time, the quarterly survey showed a 2 percent increase.  So the increase is slight.  And they are also expecting to raise wages and salaries faster, 4.2 percent this coming year.  Their biggest concerns continue to be global competition and health care costs—that has not changed at all. What I find really amazing is how much these CFOs continue to be focused on cash levels.  Right now, as you know, the liquid assets on the balance sheets of corporations are at the highest level in at least forty-five years.  Corporate profit margins relative to GDP are running at 11 percent, and that is again a record level.  If you look at the survey results, the CFOs are saying that they plan to increase cash even more in 2006.  How are they going to do that? One of the things this group is forecasting this year is for earnings to grow 13.1 percent.  Last March the survey said 11.4.  So the projection for earnings growth is up about 2 points.  They are not expecting top line revenue growth of 13 percent—they are expecting to be able to widen their operating margins.  So the trends we have been seeing are what everybody is just building on.  This inertia and this new focus on cost management seem to be central to what is going on in corporate America.  Partly, too, they are worried about top-line revenue growth, and I am hearing more of them talking about using mergers to widen their operating margins:  Grow market share through acquisition, get immediate revenue pops, pull out the extra costs, and get the bottom line growth at 13 percent that way.  They also are planning to spend more on capital expenditures this year, up 6.5 percent versus 4.7 percent, and also much more employment growth, 2 percent versus 0.6.  So they are optimistic; but again, the focus on widening operating margins from already historically wide levels and on building liquid assets shows that a real focus on the fundamentals in corporate America is continuing. If you look at the survey of small businesses, you can read the same kinds of trends in the responses.  The optimism of small business remains at a very high level.  So, in summary, I think corporate America is going to continue to push earnings growth and production but is clearly focused on cost containment.  And while they may be looking at raising prices a bit, I think overall prices will be contained. Now, a look at the household sector.  What I have been noticing in the past few months is that job growth, as many of you have mentioned, has clearly gotten a lot stronger and also that wages are growing much faster—in the last three months, they have gone up at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, which is pretty strong.  I think we have to go back about four or five years to get that kind of increase. So the real question, as many of you have said, is what is really happening to productivity.  The last time we had this kind of wage growth was in the late ’90s, and we saw the pop in productivity.  So unit labor costs were there and helped modify inflation.  I heard from the CFOs that this is exactly what they are trying to do—to find ways to improve productivity just so they can handle the higher wage cost because they are finding that skills are short in some areas.  But the highly skilled people are probably also more productive, on average, than other folks who may be looking for jobs, and hiring the more-productive workers could also help in that way. I think that the good job growth and the faster wage increases will also help put a floor on housing sales.  You know I have been concerned about where we are in terms of the mortgage constructs has been at record levels; last quarter it showed a tick down in the fourth quarter, but it still is relatively high.  Mortgage rates on the long end have not really moved very much in the last couple of years.  But to the extent that so many new mortgages were financed with adjustable-rate mortgages in the last year and the ARM rate spread now has really moved up as we have moved short rates up, there is less than a point difference now between one-year ARMs and the term rates.  So affordability, I think, is going to continue to come under more pressure going forward. Housing inventories are increasing.  Again, I talked to a CFO at a large builder.  They clearly are managing inventory much better than they did years ago, but even so, backouts on sales and such things are increasing.  The number of housing starts that they have in train and starts going forward are going to be slowing down, and they are giving guidance to the Street that they’re not going to get the sales that they had.  But even if it slows down, housing is still going to be very strong in relation to historical standards, but it will be off the peak that we have been seeing. Finally, to follow up on the comments that some of you made, I see that we still have a tremendous amount of liquidity in the financial markets.  Again, corporations are sitting on all this liquidity.  We do not hear anything from corporations about difficulty in financing big or small business.  We know the bankers clearly are looking for loan growth and trying to find it, and the housing market is able to attract all the liquidity it needs.  So in terms of how effective our rate increases have been, I see that the lag effect is still there and that plenty of liquidity is still out there, which keeps me focused on where core inflation will be. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you relate the corporate preference for cash to caution, to risk aversion, and what implications would that have for capital investment? MS. BIES.  I would say that, until about six months ago, most of it was risk aversion.  Corporations were not sure what their plans were going to be.  They did not know how they were going to get earnings growth, and so I think some was a precautionary kind of savings.  They clearly deploy most of it into restructuring their balance sheets, refinancing, and getting corporate leverage down.  A number of them use some of the cash, playing the accounting game of putting it into pension funds and booking a higher yield on the pension than they could in short-term investments in equipment and software.  But I am beginning to hear that they are more likely to loosen the strings and have more cash going forward. Another interesting thing I heard from one CFO, although somebody just mentioned the danger of anecdotes, is that they are putting more of what they call “investments” in human resource training and development than in equipment because they see that, if they cannot hire the people with skills, they have to develop the skills of the good employees they have.  We do not capture that, but it may be one of the ways they are using the cash flow. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since the last meeting, as many of us have remarked, we have seen stronger domestic demand and a little less core inflation than expected.  To a degree, this extends a pattern.  In looking at the Greenbook chart on the evolution of the staff forecast, I was struck by the steady upward drift since last fall of projected growth in 2006 and 2007, coupled with flat to downward movement in projected inflation for those years.  Now, much of the 2006 growth was shifted from 2005, but the unemployment rate at the end of this year and next is lower than it was projected last fall—without any more, and maybe even a little less, price pressure projected. One possibility is that we are seeing a smaller effect from higher energy prices than anticipated, at least on inflation and perhaps on demand as well.  Since we expected the effect of energy prices on growth rates of output and core prices to be temporary in any case, this sort of information should not deflect us from our underlying view that growth is in the process of slowing to trend, holding underlying inflation roughly stable. The cooling of the housing market is the main impetus for a slight moderation in growth.  In this regard, although the incoming data on housing have been distorted by unusual weather and subject to considerable noise, I judge them on balance to lend added support to the sense that activity and price increases are softening, albeit to an unknown extent.  I agree with President Stern that an orderly cooling of these markets with moderate effects on growth is the most likely outcome, but we just do not know yet.  Rising inventories, declining new home sales, downward movement in building permits, and a drop in mortgage applications—all point to an appreciable drop-off in the demand for housing.  In the staff forecast, residential construction flattens out this year and next, after contributing nearly half a point to GDP growth last year.  Logically, softer demand should also be reflected in prices.  Unfortunately, data for prices are even harder to read than those for activity, but the recent monthly information on existing and new home prices seems consistent with the consumption.  And we probably haven’t seen the full effect of the rise in short-term interest rates on housing demand, particularly for those who are liquidity or income constrained.  Mortgage rates have also picked up somewhat this year, and they are at the upper end of the range they have been in for the past several years.  So we could see some of the long-term mortgage rate effects as well. It is possible, of course, that the damping influence of the housing market could be offset by greater strength elsewhere, and two logical contenders are exports sparked by stronger growth abroad and business investment.  We have seen another in the series of upward revisions to foreign growth in the current Greenbook, but we have also seen greater tightening of monetary policy get built into financial markets, offsetting some of the increase in the strength of demand abroad.  Moreover, the dollar has risen on balance, reducing the feed-through of higher demand abroad to purchases from U.S. producers.  Business investment looks robust, albeit a little less so after Friday’s data on orders and shipments.  If housing takes something out of consumption, however, prospective sales growth will not be quite so strong, and this will constrain the increase in investment demand. So, on balance, I see a moderation of growth to around the rate of increase in potential as a reasonable expectation, given the structure of interest rates built into markets.  The key question is whether such a path for output will be consistent with low, stable inflation.   I think we can be encouraged by the recent data on prices and compensation.  Core consumer and inflation measures have been flat or declining on a twelve-month basis over the last six months or so, despite the uptrend in energy prices.  And inflation expectations have remained quite stable on balance.  Compensation measures are a bit more mixed.  The broadest measures, ECI and total compensation, have not picked up despite the erosion of purchasing power implied by higher energy prices and despite good trend productivity growth.  In this regard, Mr. Chairman, we do see an increase in average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers.  Maybe we are beginning to see some of this feed-through to workers on the lower end of those wages.  But, overall, I think compensation growth has been very well behaved. To be sure, we have not yet seen the effects of the recent increases in resource utilization, pressures with pretty long lives.  Given the flatness of the Phillips curve, it could take some time to perceive the inflationary effects if, indeed, the economy is operating beyond its sustainable potential.  Moreover, the staff is looking for a notable pickup in compensation.  The unit labor costs this year and next are partly absorbed by smaller markups.  At this point, however, given the recent data, I would judge these potential developments to weigh on the side of upside risks to inflation rather than tilting the most likely outcome. Both compensation and price increases have fallen short of model projections in recent quarters.  While the less-than-expected effects of energy prices could explain this more favorable relationship of output and inflation, we can’t reject the hypothesis that we are seeing something more fundamental developing, especially on the supply side of the economy.  Recent data suggest it is not an unexpected increase in productivity.  Some combination of the lower NAIRU and the anchored inflation expectations alternative simulations in the Greenbook or other factors could be holding down wages and prices.  It is far too soon to say whether anything is going on or to tease out the policy implications, but we would do well to remember just how wide those confidence intervals are, how little we know about price and output determination, and especially how little we know about the level and growth rate of potential GDP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Governor Kohn.  With apologies to those who have not had a chance to speak, I think we could adjourn now.  Let me just remind you that it is especially important, given that this is a meeting in some sense still in progress, that we maintain full confidentiality about the discussions we’re having in this room.  There is a reception and dinner on the Terrace level of the Martin Building, and I will see you there shortly. [Recess] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The meeting is reconvened.  We want to complete our go-round.  President Poole, are you ready? MR. POOLE.  Okay.  Mr. Chairman, it is a great delight to see a 200 percent increase in the number of beards around this table.  [Laughter]  Half of that was in my point forecast, and the other half was not.  [Laughter]  The contacts that I’ve talked to recently are very optimistic about activity—with one exception, which I’ll start with.  My contact at a major trucking firm said that he sees what he called a little bit of a slowdown.  Volume is essentially flat year over year across all regions and products.  He doesn’t have an explanation, but he’s the only one of my contacts who had anything negative to say about the situation. My contact at UPS had some interesting comments.  He said that both UPS and FedEx together have their networks operating at a higher level at this time of year than they have ever seen and that, at the fourth-quarter peak, they will not be able to meet demand without some new strategies.  In particular, they’re going to use pricing and incentives, I guess, to try to reduce some demand that is less profitable.  They will be working with customers to ship stuff out on Sundays that previously went on Mondays, that kind of thing.  But he says that, unless they do that sort of thing, he anticipates that they will be unable to meet demand in the fourth quarter.  Of course, they talk with their customers all the time, and they’re very optimistic.  They have had very good earnings statements, as you may have seen. My contact with Wal-Mart said something that I thought was very interesting, which I’m going to try to explore in more detail.  He said that their wages, and these are for hourly workers (possibly just for sales associates), are absolutely flat—no increases whatsoever in the last year and no increases planned going forward.  Individual workers are getting some increases, which probably average about 1 percent, as a consequence of seniority.  They have a pay scale by which workers are paid more after they have stayed there some months—I don’t know exactly how many.  And I think they also have some productivity or performance bonuses built into their pay structure, but the structure has not changed at all, so wages are increasing about 1 percent year over year.  He said that about 20 percent of their associates are part time and that they are going to be increasing that share to 40 percent so they can staff at peak times and get more productivity out of their workforce. On a national basis, the main thing I’d like to comment on is construction, and I’ll start with a local story.  There is an absolutely tremendous boom in nonresidential construction going on in St. Louis.  As a consequence of our own building project, we have close contact with the construction industry in St. Louis, and our people received a spreadsheet listing of projects in the city.  I will start with the bottom line and give you some examples of the kind of thing that is taking place.  The average St. Louis construction volume is $600 million to $700 million a year in nonresidential construction.  Now, listed in this table are multiyear projects, some are two- and three-year projects, starting last year and this year.  The total here is $5.681 billion.  It is probably several times over the normal annual volume in St. Louis.  To give you some examples, there’s $930 million worth of casino projects, including casinos and some casino hotels.  So we’re building casinos.  I guess in Dallas they’re building condos. PRESIDENT FISHER.  Same thing.  [Laughter]   MR. POOLE.  Well, Washington University has $200 million worth of projects.  Reconstruction of Interstate 64 through the city is $500 million.  A cement plant, $800 million, is being built south of St. Louis.  There are hospital projects that add up to about $525 million, waste water treatment plants, $165 million, and a whole slew of other things here.  I do not think there’s anything on this list that is multifamily housing.  This is all nonresidential.  I have a suspicion that we have much stronger nonresidential construction in the works than is visible to us.  If you think about our formal statistical process, we do not really pick up much of that in advance, and I would recommend that the staff put together a special Beige Book survey next time, trying to get an idea of what sort of contracts or expectations are out there.  The architects know it.  The companies all know it.  But we don’t have that information collated, and I think it might be very helpful. I note also that the housing industry is very visible, and there are reports almost daily of guesses about softening in that industry.  A lot of the resources, such as cement and labor, are perfectly interchangeable between residential and nonresidential construction.  So we may find with the visibility of the housing industry that the market will read some signals of a softening economy in the construction area when, in fact, there is a tremendous amount of “stealth strength” that we are not observing that is coming from the nonresidential side.  I noticed that in the Monday pre-FOMC briefing you had a special discussion of business fixed investment in general, and I think that was focused on equipment and software and not on the construction side.  But I’m guessing that we have a lot more strength in the works than appears in front of us.  My UPS contact said that they are expanding their Louisville hub facility.  Let’s see what the total was—something over a billion dollars that they are going to spend in expanding their Louisville hub. I would say one other thing.  On the inflation issue, firms don’t say very much about their own price increases except when they have problems passing on cost increases.  They may complain about some of the cost increases they’re seeing.  We do not hear very much of that.  We hear a bit of it, particularly regarding fuel, and we still get health insurance costs.  Except for that, we do not hear very much, but I think we are going to have to ask very explicitly in order to extract from firms what they are doing on their own pricing front because it is not something that they naturally volunteer.  All their own price increases, of course, are fully justifiable and sensible, and only the cost increases that they are having trouble absorbing are a problem that they would bring to our attention.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The comment and suggestion on nonresidential construction is very helpful, very interesting.  On the Wal-Mart wage increases of 1 percent—hasn’t Wal-Mart increased health coverage and compensation overall? MR. POOLE.  Yes, this is the straight hourly wage.  They do have some benefit cost increases.  I think that, in their budget, they are expecting 7.8 percent over the course of this year.  They have been changing the structure of their benefit programs.  And the other thing that my contact there said, although I didn’t talk to him about it this time, is that they’re observing lower utilization—that is, apparently they believe that a lot of the low-wage demographic, as they put it, is somewhat stressed.  They see that in their own sales in terms of the kinds of things that people are buying.  They say that there is a lot of strength at the upper end of their demographic and weakness at the lower end, but their own labor force is using health care less intensively than before, perhaps because of the pressures from absorbing energy-price increases and that sort of thing.  So the copays that they are charging—the deductibles—are enough to reduce the utilization.  That is why the outlay they are expecting is up only 8 percent.  I am sure that the cost per unit delivered is rising more quickly than that, but there is lower utilization. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Olson. MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparation for today’s meeting, I talked with the CEOs of three banks—one major money center, one major East Coast regional bank, and one major West Coast—that pretty well have the markets covered.  There have been times when those conversations have either been directionally or substantively at odds with, or maybe ahead of, our Greenbook and our preparation data, but not this time.  The conversations pretty well corroborated or were consistent with both the Greenbook and our flow of funds data.  They all reported that, into ’06, consumer loans remain strong with good prospects for growth.  Asset quality remains very good, above levels that historical experience would suggest they could maintain.  Interestingly, we had that message a year ago, that asset quality was better than what they thought they could maintain through their normal credit review process, and that situation continues.  Commercial lending continues to be solid for both large and small borrowers, but the utilization of credit lines still remains at about 50 percent.  So it means that we are moving up from a very soft commercial loan market and may, in fact, be consistent with what President Poole suggested. This comes back to a question that President Hoenig raised yesterday.  The markets are much more concerned with event risk than with inflation risk—which is to say, issues like major energy disruptions, terrorism activity, or even weather-related activity.  This means that risk avoidance tends to be, to a significant extent, related to geography or market segment. Two particular areas struck my contacts and, therefore, me as being unusual and worthy of comment.  One of them relates to a significant change in the market for initial public offerings, and this particularly came from the West Coast.  The expectations for start-ups, particularly tech start-ups, are much more stringent on the West Coast.  A couple of years ago, a very good idea could generate a significant IPO experience, but now a good idea plus five years of solid cash-flow experience might result in half the level of an IPO that they would have had fairly recently.  The venture capital side of the business notices that very significant change.  A start-up today is much more likely to end up being an acquisition candidate than an IPO, and the reason for that may be varied.  Part of the reason might be caution, but a lot of it is being attributed to the additional regulatory burden, particularly the Sarbanes–Oxley regulatory burden. In the money center, the liquidity in the market is provided significantly by the institutional investors, and the activity on the loan side is to a great extent in structured credit.  The collateralized loan obligations and the collateralized debt obligations are providing a lot of that activity.  One significant change that is sort of consistent with the IPO experience is that, in many cases, internationally active businesses are more apt to go offshore for either debt or equity and do it as a private placement rather than do it in the United States.  Also, the banks that are active internationally can follow the flow either through a direct transaction or through some sort of a collateralized arrangement that can provide the financing, so an international customer has a distinct advantage in doing business with an international bank. An overall reflection on the economy:  Consumer activity remains strong, but flattening of real estate equities will certainly restrain the wealth effect on consumption to some extent.  In the so-called bubble markets, we are clearly seeing prices drop.  In the mortgage business, the purchase mortgages are very active, but refinancings are almost entirely eliminated.  There is a significant disparity between U.S. and offshore markets in terms of regulatory reporting requirements, and that is becoming increasingly apparent and has become a factor in both credit and equity issuance.  Notably there is a significant absence of concern expressed about inflationary pressure:  None of the three CEOs expressed concern that they are feeling the effect of inflation.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did the banks comment on the yield curve; is it affecting them? MR. OLSON.  We did not hear much comment.  I expected to hear much on the yield curve, but I did not have any specific comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to everyone around the table.  I think Governor Kroszner and I share the view that people have been incredibly kind and supportive in teaching us the ways of this institution in the past weeks.  So we certainly appreciate that.  I know I do.  The only advice that I was given last night that I will not take is that they say that Governors at their first meeting should sing their opening remarks.  [Laughter]  I thought it was a joke, but I guess that we’ll test it here.  [Laughter]  Allow me to offer just a few perspectives consistent, I think, with a lot of the discussion yesterday and maybe some particular focus on business investment.  As was discussed, the economy appears to be stronger, but as I think about the economy today versus over the last several periods, what strikes me is how much more well balanced it is than it was over recent periods.  The equity markets, the credit markets, and certainly the anecdotal information that I’ve gleaned in my several weeks here and before, all tend to confirm that view.  And although there are meaningful risks to the economy, my own view is that there is a greater upside potential for growth than expressed in the Greenbook. A few notes about the consumer before I spend the balance of my time on business investment.  First, the consumer appears to be strong, as we discussed yesterday.  And my own sense is that, while there may well be softening in the residential market, staggered repricing of adjustable-rate mortgages and perhaps potential sales of a very novel, new housing product—the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage—[laughter] may simplify things, particularly if the shape of the curve keeps its current trajectory.  Second, I would expect there to be, as I think the Greenbook referenced, accelerating household income growth and perhaps new job creation more robust even than was described in the Greenbook, particularly if some of the productivity gains that we have seen over the past several years tend to moderate. Let me spend a few more moments now on the business capital expenditure side.  My own view is that the strength of business capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment may well surprise to the upside.  I think what we saw earlier in this recovery, both anecdotally as well as in the data, was a growth in cap-ex by a lot of the small and medium-sized businesses.  And as one CEO said to me a couple of weeks ago, big company CEOs have now gotten that memo.  Opportunities to drive profit margins through productivity improvements appear to be diminishing somewhat, and so there appears to be a tendency, a greater willingness, to go back to the well and to get cap-ex back up to speed.  Two obvious indicia of greater cap-ex—which we’ve seen for some time and that would have suggested to many of us, including me, that business cap-ex would have ramped up sooner—are, of course, the strong corporate profits and these corporate balance sheets that are in remarkable shape.  What I would like to spend a little time on is, well, what is new?  What is going to make cap-ex grow over 2006 above and beyond the projections to this point?  And so, as I talk about two other catalysts, I would suggest that they are not really reflected in the data yet.  But my own sense is that we should see them or at least there is a greater probability of seeing them in the balance of the year.  Of course, current regulatory and enforcement issues are still consuming significant CEO time and significant director and officer time, and that does tend to cast a rather deep shadow over these cap-ex budgets.  What we are going to find in this proxy season is an occupation or preoccupation, both in the business press and in some boardrooms, with the ongoing fight over majority election of directors.  There will be fights in boardrooms, fights by institutional shareholders, and a whole range of op-ed pieces about how these directors get put on boards and whether the system should be reformed.  Obviously, the current environment and the fight over shareholder democracy still tend to cast a bit of a shadow.  So I guess the question really is, what’s different now? I would note two catalysts.  One is CEO confidence.  I think Governor Bies yesterday referred to this in a couple of the surveys.  CEO confidence—that look in their eyes, their view of the animal spirits—appears to be back in stronger measure than I at least have heard in some time.  What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves.  Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics.  One CEO said to me about a week ago, “Being a board member is starting to be fun again,” and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago.  I don’t think he was referring to the days of going to the golf course in the middle of the board meeting.  What he meant by the board’s being fun again is that board members are focused on where the company should be going.  How should they be growing their business?  Should they be more vested on the mergers and acquisition side?  Should they be more focused on capital expenditures?  And so from that CEO and from many others, we are hearing far fewer complaints about Sarbanes–Oxley.  It does not mean that the complaints are not there, but my sense is that most of these companies have now been able, at least, to put a box around their compliance burdens.  They have been able to check that box, go through their 404 controls once or twice, and though they still do not like it, the burden is no longer consuming their minds when they come to the boardroom. I think what we are going to see in the balance of 2006 are board members coming back to boards as “strategic advisers,” with a somewhat diminished role for board members as “compliance officers.”  And that is a good thing with respect to cap-ex because the more they are focused on their businesses, the more they are focused on helping companies grow.  I think that such focus is probably incrementally quite positive to a decision about investing the next billion dollars in property, plant, and equipment.  So looking outward, I sense that companies are seeing bigger and bolder opportunities, and that situation is a necessary precursor to understanding whether or not these cap-ex numbers increase. The second catalyst that I note may be a touch more controversial—how outsiders are looking at companies.  I guess the way I would say it is not that the barbarians are back at the gates but that they are gathering.  When you look at the private equity world, the leveraged buyout world, and the emerging hedge fund world, the “outsiders” are now looking at each other in a series of alliances and are starting to look with a keener eye toward corporate America.  They probably have seen the excess cash and, frankly, the conservatism of boardrooms and the conservatism of companies borne in the past five years and are willing to “think the unthinkable” and take greater advantage of that opportunity. I think Governor Olson made reference to the IPO market, which is really telling us many of the same things—whether a company that is public has, all of a sudden, a new interest in going private or an IPO candidate is saying, “Really, what is in it for me?  Why should I enter the capital flow that way?”  Another reason that the IPO market is not as robust as perhaps it would have been in previous periods like this relates to research.  You have to be a very big and very bold company to be getting large, bulge-bracket firms writing equity research and explaining your company to a greater pool of shareholders.  For an IPO candidate or even for a public company that has been around awhile with a few billion dollar market cap, getting that kind of research and that sort of investor base is much harder to do than it was in the years before Sarbanes–Oxley. Another item I have considered is merger and acquisition backlogs.  The backlogs that are on file by the largest investment banks and merger advisers are bigger now than they have been in the past six years and maybe even before that.  The difference in the backlogs this time versus in previous years, I think, is how much is really private equity.  It looks as though, in broad numbers, about a quarter to a third are private equity investors, LBO investors that are looking at companies that, because of size or background, they would frankly not have spent as much time looking at in years past.  You have a range of LBO players that are now back, and they are now describing themselves as shareholder activists and corporate governance experts.  But twenty years ago they were there, and they were focused much as they are now on shareholder value. So both the signs—from companies that are internally evaluating their own boardroom dynamics and from investment companies that are looking to come to the gates and to take a couple of these companies private—remind us that companies have a perspective about their own cash that is either use it or lose it.  And it would not surprise me to find some very large “blue chip” companies that feel either under attack or on the precipice of being attacked tending to be bolder in their capital expenditure budgets. What’s likely to happen in the capital markets should that all come to pass?  One thing that large-cap “blue chip” companies with exceptional investment-grade ratings will all of a sudden find that they are in play by some LBO buyers and private equity participants.  As you all well know, generally in the investment-grade market there has not been much of a change-of-control premium in investment-grade credit, unlike in the high-yield market.  But should a couple of large transactions occur either here in the United States or in Europe, where a double-A credit one day ends up looking more like a high-yield credit the next, we might find that investment-grade investors are asking for a greater premium in those markets.  I think all of this is a possibility as we think about ’06 and ’07—not a promise but a real possibility that we should continue to keep a keen eye on and evaluate.  As that dynamic goes forward, we will have an early signal telling us whether the cap-ex numbers will come in larger than expected. Finally, with respect to inflation, I would add to some of the comments that the Vice Chairman made yesterday by noting that long-term inflation expectations as calculated in the TIPS commodity prices and other material inputs might also cause further pressure on inflation.  As we as a Committee approach our last step or our penultimate step in possibly moving rates, the markets will be more and more focused on our own vigilance with respect to those inflation expectations.  With that, I have finished. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  I received the same advice that Kevin did.  [Singing] “To dream the impossible—”  [Laughter]   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any two-handed interventions?  [Laughter]   MR. KROSZNER.  Obviously, from the remarks that we heard earlier today and yesterday, there is an enormous amount of strength and resiliency in the economy.  Clearly, the economy has rebounded from a temporary slowdown in the fourth quarter.  The specifics that I have heard from each of the Districts confirm the broad Greenbook view that this is going to be a pretty strong quarter.  I particularly like the quotation from President Fisher that it will be “blowing and going” during this quarter.  A forecast of 3¾ percent real GDP growth for 2006 with perhaps a bit of slowing in 2007 seems quite reasonable given the data that we have in hand.  Consumption remains solid, and despite some less-sanguine reports at the end of last week about some orders, business investment still appears to be reasonably strong. Since there seems to be much agreement with the central tendency of the forecast, rather than review my reasons for supporting it—and I support most of the reasons that people put forward—what I want to do is focus on a few potential risk factors going forward.  Not that I necessarily think that these things are likely to happen, but as Dave Stockton mentioned yesterday, there are a number of uncertainties in the forecast, which we need to focus on:  First, with respect to housing; second, with respect to energy and commodity prices; and, third, with respect to expectations in the yield curve and the term premium issues that the Chairman asked us about yesterday. We have been receiving some mixed signals with respect to the housing market, although the components that tend to have the most information for assessing the future direction of the very hot period in 2005.  The evidence that I have from talking to property developers in the Chicago area and a bit in D.C. seems to be consistent with this evaluation, particularly in things like the condo market.  We see a lot of slowing there, particularly in the Chicago area—at least from what I have heard anecdotally.  Not only are we faced with the forecaster’s typical dilemma of trying to predict a trend break or a turning point, but we also have relatively few experiences in the United States over the last few decades of a downturn in the housing market.  So the key concern is going to be the effect on wealth and on consumption and obviously also on the construction market. In the Greenbook, I believe the direct contribution of wealth to real PCE growth was approximately 1 percent in 2005, and the forecast is about ¾ percent in 2006, with at least half of each of these increments due to housing wealth.  So, obviously, we have to be very sensitive to the concerns there.  In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, even some relatively moderate downturns or slowdowns in the housing market seem to have been associated with some fairly important GDP effects. President Stern yesterday made an important point of what’s driving what.  Many of the discussions about the housing market suggest that there will be some sort of exogenous shock that somehow may send the housing market down, as opposed to the housing market’s being part of the broader economy in which there are consumption demands for investment and in which houses are an asset as part of a portfolio.  It is important to put housing in that context.  In the other countries where we have seen downturns and GDP effects, it is hard to pull out what part was due to housing’s lead as opposed to housing’s just being one of the factors affected by a general economic downturn.  So with those caveats in mind, and obviously we have to be careful about extrapolating from other countries’ experiences, I do think we should be mindful of the potential risks that are there. Second, energy and commodity prices:  So far we have been very fortunate in seeing little, if any, of the run-up in energy and commodity prices feeding through to core measures of inflation, and from what I can tell in the discussions relating to the Greenbook, this has been a bit of a surprise to the staff and a bit of a surprise to the Committee.  Now, this may well be due to a confluence of very fortunate factors that perhaps could be reversed in the near term, or it may be due to some longer-run changes, which President Fisher discussed.  We had some discussion of this yesterday.  So, as you know, productivity growth and international competition could be important factors, but at this point I do not feel that I understand enough whether this situation is just temporary and we are lucky or whether it is part of an ongoing process.  And so I think we just have to be mindful of the potential risk there.  And obviously with the uptick in forecasts for growth outside the United States, which could be associated with an increase in demand for energy and raw materials, further upward pressure could be put on those prices. Finally, inflation expectations in the yield curve and term premiums:  Fortunately, generally the market-based and survey-based measures of inflation seem to be fairly steady, reasonably well contained.  I share Kevin’s concern that some of these expectations being above 2, 2½, even in some cases closer to 3 may be a bit of a challenge, but broadly the numbers that we have been seeing around 2 seem to suggest that inflation expectations are well anchored.  And it seems that one of the great achievements of this body that I have now been very fortunate and very honored to become part of is the reduction of inflation uncertainty and the reduction of inflation expectations.  And these reductions, I think, help us at least in part to understand the very low term premiums that we have been seeing in the United States. But we must also recognize that we have been seeing lower real and nominal rates and generally lower term premiums around the world.  In talking to market participants, I hear much less of a fear of an inflation spike in many countries around the world—not that there was a fear of an inflation spike in the United States—but I think a greater certainty about the direction and focus of the FOMC and a greater trust is extremely important. This gets back to a point that President Lacker made yesterday about the incredibly important role of expectations.  What we do has to be seen not just in terms of the traditional backward-looking role of thinking about how the higher cost of capital could affect choices that people make, but also about our credibility in going forward.  Choices that we make may have opposite effects on interest rates than what we have seen in the past.  Raising interest rates in the short-term may have a damping effect rather than an increasing effect on longer rates. If you look to forecasts of economists outside this room and the System, you also see a fair amount of optimism, suggesting growth in the future.  So the lower real and nominal rates in the longer-term markets do not seem to be due to concerns about significant slowing of the economy but to differences in views about inflation uncertainty and the level of inflation going forward.  So, particularly since some of our measures—of core PCE, core CPI—are at or toward the upper end of the range of where I would feel comfortable (and, I believe, from what I have heard, a number of others around the table would feel comfortable), we have to be vigilant about that.  Maintaining our credibility and the good work that this Committee has done is something that I want not to become dreaming the impossible dream but something that is the reality and that we can continue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I would like now to summarize these views and add a few comments of my own.  At that point, if there are additional comments or questions, they will be welcome. We have had, I think, a fairly upbeat group here the last couple of days, which is of course good, both in terms of views of economic activity and in terms of keeping inflation well controlled.  The economy appears to be quite strong, but my sense is that most people feel that risks on that score are relatively balanced, which I take to imply that, after being strong in this quarter, growth will slow to something closer to a more-sustainable pace in the remainder of the year.  Perhaps the leading source of uncertainty on the output side is the housing market, but I was reassured to hear that most participants think that a decline in housing will be cushioned by strong fundamentals in terms of income, jobs, and continuing low interest rates.  The labor market is clearly continuing to strengthen, but I heard not too many concerns about increasing wage pressures.  There was some discussion about shortages of more highly skilled workers, which presumably might affect wages at some point but apparently has not so far; and there was additional discussion of productivity gains, which are helping to keep unit labor costs down and to support growth. On the inflation side, I have not been in this conversation for a while, but I was impressed at least relative to a year ago that the angst about inflation seems to have declined.  Clearly, inflation expectations are well anchored.  Margins are high, and the sense of the group was that pass-through to consumer inflation was likely to be limited.  Still, I took from the group some sense of at least a slight upside risk to inflation, reflecting the increasing resource utilization; the fact that inflation is somewhat on the high side of what many people describe as their comfort zone; and the fact that, if inflation does rise, there will be costs to bringing it back down and maintaining our credibility. So that is my overall summary of the Committee discussion.  My own views, you will probably not be surprised to hear, are not radically different from what we have heard around the table.  I would point out, first, that except for housing, the economy continues to be very strong.  One might be tempted to average the expected rate of growth of the first quarter at about 4½ percent with the 1½ percent of the fourth quarter and say we’re at a pace of about 3 percent, but then I would remind you that we had 4.1 percent in the third quarter despite Katrina and about 3.7 percent average growth in the first three quarters of ’05. We have a strengthening world economy.  We have consumption that looks likely to be well supported by income and jobs.  Several people have talked about the strength of investment in nonresidential construction.  Job creation at about 200,000 a month is clearly above the long-run sustainable rate.  So except for housing—and that is, of course, a critical sector—it looks as though the economy is, if anything, growing more quickly than potential. Housing is the crucial issue.  To get a soft landing, we need some cooling in housing.  So far there is a good bit of evidence that there has been a peak, but we do not know a great deal more than that.  So obviously we are going to have to watch carefully.  The range of possible outcomes is quite wide.  I agree with most of the commentary that the strong fundamentals support a relatively soft landing in housing.  A pessimist might point out that the expectation of future price increases is itself an important part of the user cost of housing.  A sea change in people’s views about what is going to happen to house prices in the future might significantly affect their perceived cost of owning a house and lead to lower prices and to weaker activity.  On the other side, residential investment is, of course, only about 6 percent of GDP, and so long as consumption is well maintained by incomes, jobs, and other factors, I think it would take a very strong decline in the housing market to substantially derail the strong momentum for growth that we are currently seeing in the economy. What we might see in the next few quarters is some quarter-to-quarter variation.  We may not have the stability of growth that we have had the last couple of years.  If that happens, we should be willing to accept it.  I might offer a very rough analogy to the way we think about energy prices and core inflation.  With core inflation, our goal is to accommodate energy prices but to make sure that they do not get into the underlying rate of inflation.  Again, this might be a rough analogy, but if the housing market moves significantly, we should perhaps not try to upset that movement but rather just try to ensure that the resources that are released are deployed in the rest of the economy and that the rest of the economy remains on a stable path.  Again, I think we are unlikely to see growth being derailed by the housing market, but I do want us to be prepared for some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  So, broadly speaking, I agree with the Committee that we should see some cooling for the remainder of the year and that we should approach a more-sustainable pace of growth.  But I think there is some upside volatility risk, if you will, because of the fluctuations in residential investment. On inflation, like most of you, I am struck by how well behaved core inflation has been.  Indeed, in 2005, core inflation was even slightly lower than it was in 2004, and we have all pointed to a number of explanations, including well-anchored inflation expectations, international competition, productivity growth, and since I wasn’t here, I can say good Fed policy.  [Laughter]  One area of uncertainty in trying to look forward is unit labor costs.  Remarkably, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector grew only 1.3 percent in 2005, but as was already mentioned in the staff presentation, I think that understates the trend because it is coming off the surge in the fourth quarter of ’04 in bonuses, stock options, and other types of one-time compensation.  If you smooth through that bulge, it looks as though the underlying trend of unit labor costs is more like 1.7 percent, and perhaps that may have some upward bias.  There is certainly a lot of uncertainty about that, though.  We have seen some indicators, such as average hourly earnings, rising.  Other indicators, such as the employment cost index, are slowing.  I just point this out as a significant source of uncertainty, given how difficult it is to forecast both compensation and productivity going forward.  So, again, the stability of inflation in the last couple of years is very reassuring.  I would note, however, that over the past three years, since 2003, we have seen a pickup in inflation.  That was, of course, by design, but I think it is important for us to think about why that happened.  There’s something of an identification problem here.  To the extent that the increase in inflation over the last two to three years reflected the pass-through of energy costs and commodity prices, that is actually good news in a sense because, to the extent that those factors soften and flatten in the coming year, we should see some reduction in inflation in ’06 and ’07.  To the extent that inflation increases in the last two and a half years reflected increased resource utilization, the strength in the economy, and the return of pricing power, however, there is a bit of concern that we Like most of you, I am not at all alarmist about inflation.  I think the worst that is likely to happen would be 20 or 30 basis points over the next year.  But even that amount is a little disconcerting for me.  I think it is very important for us to maintain our credibility on inflation and it would be somewhat expensive to bring that additional inflation back down.  So my bottom line on inflation is that there is a very modest upside risk.  Again, I think it’s not a large risk but one that we probably should pay attention to. Are there any comments or questions to close our round on the economic outlook?  If not, we can move to the policy round.  In a moment I’m going to turn to Vincent to introduce the policy options in the statement.  Before I do that, I just want to note that we have left unresolved the discussion about the ownership of the statement—in particular, what we are voting on when we vote at the end of the meeting.  Currently we vote on the action, on the directive, and on the risk assessment but not on the rationale.  The rationale has, however, been largely a consensus paragraph worked out by the Committee.  My sense is that this decision is not entirely separable from a wide range of other issues we may want to talk about over the next few quarters concerning the content of the statement, its structure, whether we use forward-looking language, and whether we consider adopting some kind of numerical guidepost for inflation.  And so what I would like to do, if it is okay with the Committee, is to maintain the status quo for today in terms of our voting in this statement.  By the next meeting, in May, I will come back to the Committee with a proposal for a process by which we can address this whole range of issues over a period of time, and on the top of the agenda for that process will be the ownership of the statement.  Is that acceptable?  All right.  Seeing assent, we will maintain the status quo on the statement just for today.  Vincent, whenever you are ready. MR. REINHART.2  Carol Low will be handing out some material.  Market participants expect you to take another ¼ point step today along the journey started in line, are consistent with the funds rate target moving up to 4¾ percent this afternoon.  Compared with what was expected just after your January meeting (the red line) financial prices indicate increased expectations of an additional ¼ point firming in coming months. This ratcheting up of the policy path was due in part to economic data that mostly ran on the strong side of expectations and to the absence of a signal from any of you that the tightening cycle was drawing to a close.  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers, highlights of which are noted in the top right panel, is also consistent with the certainty of action today and suggests the anticipation of little change to the statement and the retention of the assessment that the risks to the outlook are tilted to the upside.  As plotted in the middle left panel, options contracts on fed funds futures settling after the June FOMC meeting put the largest probability weight on one more ¼ point firming after today and about equal but less weight on the process of tightening ending after today or continuing after May.  The dotted staircase in the middle right panel shows how far you’ve come along the path begun at the June 2004 FOMC meeting:  ¼ point steps at fourteen successive meetings.  The solid line plots the expected federal funds rate derived from money market futures price prevailing just before the June 2004 meeting.  As can be seen, your policy firming through last winter about matched the track anticipated at the onset of the cycle.  It has been only in the past five meetings that you picked up the pace relative to market expectations of nearly two years ago.  As to why you might have tightened more than investors originally expected, the answer is not evident in the bottom left panel, which gives the evolution of the staff forecast for real GDP growth for 2005, 2006, and 2007 over successive Greenbooks.  If anything, the outlook for real growth has moved a touch south over that period.  But as shown at the bottom right, the staff outlook for inflation back in June 2004 was factors, the more-favorable prospects at the time for the prices of oil and other imported items.  If investors also underestimated the extent to which inflation would rise, then it wouldn’t be surprising that they would also have underestimated the extent of your policy tightening thus far.  Concerns about the prospects for inflation lie at the heart of the case for adding another ¼ point step to this tightening episode, the subject of exhibit 2.  Policy tightening to date has brought the real federal funds rate, the solid line in the top panel, past the middle of the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium.  Bringing the nominal federal funds rate to 4¾ percent would put the real funds rate at the top end of that red range, although still well in the middle of the confidence band around                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). those estimates.  Such a stance, though, would be called for if you viewed inflation as uncomfortably high in your preferred range or poised to rise from its current level.  How deeply those possibilities are felt marks the difference between alternatives B and C in the Bluebook—that is, between signaling a modest or a strong inclination to tighten at the May meeting.  Market participants, to be sure, are confident of a tightening today and put high odds that you will follow with another such action in validate those expectations and would be preferred if you viewed the staff forecast in the bottom left panel of an unemployment rate under 5 percent and inflation near 2 percent to be both plausible and acceptable.  The Committee might want to project a firmer stance of policy—that is, a sure tightening in May and a chance of further action as in alternative C—for several reasons.  Chief among them might be some mistrust of the main mechanism producing slowing in consumer spending in the staff forecast—namely, the deceleration in house prices plotted at the bottom right.  Although anecdotes of slowing in the housing market abound, you might not be ready to sign on to that outlook until more convincing evidence is in hand.  I now turn to the question posed at the top of exhibit 3.  When are you going to stop?  According to surveys and, as shown in the top left panel, futures markets predict that you’ll most likely cease tightening by June.  The policy rules plotted at the top right would predict a quicker end than that—indeed, they see some odds that you would already be done.  Another perspective is given in the middle panel, which plots as the red line the long-run expected short rate consistent with the staff’s arbitrage-free model of the term structure.  The current short rate, the dark solid line, has already marched up to that long-run level.    You might view arguments for further tightening to be problematic for a number of reasons.  The solid line in the bottom left panel plots the Greenbook forecast for real GDP growth.  It not only slopes downward, but its historical confidence regions also encompass a significant possibility of subpar growth, as in the lower shaded region.  True, there is an upper shaded region, too, but if your own outlook lies below the Greenbook path or you weigh the lower outcomes more heavily than the higher ones, then you would want a lower, not higher, federal funds rate.  The standard argument for further policy action is that its absence would risk inflaming inflation expectations.  As shown in the bottom right panel, however, inflation compensation at a long horizon has remained very subdued.  The Committee’s choice of the funds rate target is only part of its decision.  Some wording issues are considered in exhibit 4.  In alternatives B and C in the Bluebook, we kept the risk assessment tilted toward tightening, as in the top panel.  But as shown directly below, the confidence bounds surrounding estimated policy rules (the green region at the left) or inferred from money market options (the blue region at the right) are quite wide.  This suggests that the time will soon arrive when you will no longer be confident in predicting the likely future direction of your next action.  If any of you thinks that time is now, we did offer words for a balanced risk assessment in alternative A.  Another sentence offered in alternative A is in the third row of the exhibit.  The statement could end, “Nevertheless, future policy action will be determined by the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.”  I admit that those words don’t mean anything different from what appeared at the end of the though, that changing the language might draw attention to the sentiment.  Despite the presence of that data-dependent clause in previous statements and its reinforcement in successive minutes, market participants seem more focused on the messages they are receiving from you than from the economic data.  For instance, as noted in the bottom row, the response of the two-year note, measured along the vertical axes, to surprises in nonfarm payrolls, measured along the horizontal axes, had been elevated from 2003 to 2004 (that’s the middle scatterplot).  However, over the past 1¼ years, as can be seen at the far right, the response has been more subdued, perhaps necessitating a reminder to markets to look to the data.  I’d like to point out another design aspect of alternative A, which is provided in the latest version of table 1 at the end of your handout.  As is evident, we squeezed a lot of words into that column.  We did it for two reasons.  First, it seemed appropriate for the Committee to offer an extended rationale for ending a tightening phase that has lasted nearly two years.  Second, as you become less sure of your future policy action—remember, this alternative has a balanced risk assessment—you might want a fuller description of the economic outlook.  By the way, a longer statement might give you the opportunity to rely less on imprecise adjectives and more on a recitation of key facts.  We tried that out last week with our first draft of table 1, but the few of you who commented were deeply enough opposed that we struck the numerical reference.  I’d also like to point out changes made in the table overnight in light of your discussion yesterday, which are provided in blue and seem mostly consistent with what was said earlier this morning.  Meeting participants emphasized that growth rebounded strongly and appears likely to settle to a pace consistent with that of the economy’s potential to produce.  As a result, the risks to the growth outlook appear roughly balanced.  In alternative B, we added some forward-looking language to that effect in row 2.  Because many of you seemed a bit more optimistic about the prospects for inflation, we repeated the qualifier “possible” from the January statement in front of “increases in resource utilization” in row 3 for alternatives A and B.  The other minor changes were made for stylistic reasons.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Vincent?   MS. MINEHAN.  I have a small question.  Vince, in your scatter diagram, you seem to be inferring—at least the way I heard you say it—that, based on the last couple of years, people are looking more to what we say than what we do.  What we say has been a lot of the action over the last couple of years.  Do we really have enough data to make that assessment—that, in fact, markets won’t, going forward, be more sensitive to the data than to what we say? MR. REINHART.  You are right—there are not a lot of dots in that bottom right scatter plot. MS. MINEHAN.  And we pretty much have told them for three years to listen to what we say. MR. REINHART.  We did include a box in the Bluebook that showed a more systematic look at the response to data and that was not looking just at the payroll employment surprise.  It was looking at eleven different surprises.  And it was the case that the response, no matter—Governor Kohn is grimacing, but that’s okay. [Laughter] MS. MINEHAN.  One of his favorite charts, I think. MR. REINHART.  I can tell. MR. KOHN.  My favorite facial expression. MR. REINHART.  It’s toward the back if you want to refer to it.  But the point is, the response has moved down.  What is actually interesting is that, if you split these data observations into real side and inflation, the response to inflation data has come down the most, consistent with the view that they think that the Federal Reserve has actually contained inflation and also consistent with subdued inflation expectations. MS. MINEHAN.  Right. MR. REINHART.  That is a long answer to what I really should say:  Yes, you are right.  We don’t have enough observations to really know. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Two-handed intervention.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I just want to ask Vince a question on the word “possible” in the third row here.  Could you elaborate on why you put that word in?  It just says, the way it said before, that increases in resource utilization have the potential to add to inflationary pressures.  I mean, there have been increases in resource utilization. MR. REINHART.  So some concern was expressed that having dropped the word “possible” relative to what was in January, the Committee would be making the determination that, indeed, economic slack had gone away and that the channel itself would put upward pressure on inflation. MR. MOSKOW.  But capacity utilization is higher.  The unemployment rate is lower. MR. REINHART.  Right, but I think the issue there is that it is true that resource utilization has tightened, but then to make the determination that it could add to inflation pressures is to say that it, in fact, has gone past the level of full capacity—that is, the unemployment rate is below the natural rate and output is above capacity.  It did not seem, at least from the discussion yesterday,  that everyone would buy onto the view that the economy was working above its potential. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I take it that you would like us to give the policy recommendation that we would favor at this point? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, let me clarify.  I’m sorry.  We’re still in the question mode. MR. POOLE.  Oh, okay.  I thought we were starting the round. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  Do you have a question? MR. POOLE.  No. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Olson, do you have a question? MR. OLSON.  No. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We have some breakdown here in our system.  [Laughter]  Are there further questions for Vincent?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I am curious about the question Janet asked in a memo last week about singling out slower productivity growth or—what was it?—productivity gains.  Doesn’t that phrase sort of convey some implicit theorizing? MR. REINHART.  Heaven forfend.  [Laughter]   MR. LACKER.  Well, that seems be the point of the question.  I was just wondering what you thought about it. MR. REINHART.  I would note that, in your discussion of the economy yesterday, a number of you did point out that a well-maintained trend in productivity is holding unit labor costs in check.  I am not doing well in facial expressions, but yes.  So I will take your objection as saying that this is, in fact, an inner working in the inflation process that is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, and it is not appropriate to single out one of the parts of a mechanism at this particular time. MR. LACKER.  So it is consistent with the world in which the policy function we are expected to follow has nominal compensation growth not responding to productivity growth changes.  Productivity growth changes, and it changes unit labor costs.  It doesn’t change compensation growth.  So it has inflation responding to changes in productivity costs. MR. REINHART.  I guess I would have to admit that the words are not that clear.  What we meant rather was that, for the given increases in compensation, structural productivity growth has kept unit labor costs from expanding more than they would otherwise. MR. LACKER.  Then it is a statement like these arithmetical contributions to GDP. MR. REINHART.  Right. MR. LACKER.  Well, okay.  It is a different statement. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  In the go-round I am interested, of course, in your view on the policy action, and I am also interested in your view on the statement.  So that would also be an appropriate place if you want to raise issues about the wording.  That would be fine.  Other questions for Vincent?  Vice Chairman. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Dave Stockton gave us a gentle admonishment yesterday to clarify our inflation preferences.  At least that is the way I interpreted it.  You can interpret it that way or that he responded to a question by suggesting that, in the absence of that clarity, [laughter] the staff should not be vulnerable to the criticism applied.  But I wonder whether Vince or David wanted to say a bit more about whether it actually matters in thinking about the optimal terminal point for the fed funds rate in this tightening cycle whether we have a 1.5 percent objective for core PCE inflation over time or whether that objective is at 2.  If you look at the Bluebook, chart 7—I am not sure what page that is on— MR. REINHART.  Nineteen. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Page 19.  You can get one set of answers to that.  You have not given us this time the perfect-foresight, optimal-policy-rule type of prisms to look at the same question.  But could you give us just a little sense of whether it matters now? MR. REINHART.  Well, as part of the discussion from yesterday, these policy rules are pretty inertial, and in the seven quarters of data to the right of the forecast line, you’re not really going to see a material difference from your choice of inflation objectives.  As you can see in the table, it really means only 10 basis points for the policy rules whether you have a 2 percent goal or a 1½ percent goal.  Ultimately it matters a lot, and you see that in the extended Greenbook forecast.  You see it in the optimal-control exercises we showed previously, particularly in versions of the model that involve perfect foresight.  You bring forward some of that action, and so that ½ percentage point difference in your inflation goal does actually control the amount of overshooting of the funds rate that you’re going to find appropriate. MR. STOCKTON.  Obviously, in addition to the importance of the target or the objective itself is your degree of patience or impatience about getting there.  When we construct the extended Greenbook, in some sense we don’t get to the objective very quickly just because there may be inertia in policy.  That’s up to you to make a decision about.  Then there are the questions about how long it takes for economic activity to respond to the policy that you put in place and what transmission there is into inflation of that change in policy.  And those things, at least in our large-scale model, take a long time to steer an inflation rate from one direction to another.  Now, obviously, to the extent that inflation expectations can jump or move quickly, that model may overstate the degree of inertia in the inflation process, and you might be able to achieve more quickly an inflation objective with a more-pronounced change in policy.  But that’s not the sort of structure of the model that we are working with here. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Vincent, in your comments about the Desk survey and what markets are anticipating, you said that they anticipate little change in the statement.  But there have been some concerns—and, in fact, even a short article in the Wall Street Journal today mentions—that if there is no change in the statement that was made in January, investors will probably ratchet up their rate expectations.  And there is a risk that, with no signaling, after the meeting they will build two more moves into the future.  Have you given any thought to how to prevent that from happening? MR. REINHART.  The words in alternative B were designed to try to keep the prevailing path for policy expectations, and that’s one of the reasons they are different from what is in the leftmost column from the January FOMC statement.  I think I agree with your assessment that, if you merely repeated the January statement, then market participants would have two observations in which the words “some further policy firming may be needed” imply certain action at the next meeting. MS. PIANALTO.  But then it has also built in an expectation of another action at the next meeting. MR. REINHART.  Right. MS. PIANALTO.  And so, when they expect little change, it is hard to know whether it is no change in paragraph 4 versus little change in the rationale statement. MR. REINHART.  We retained the words of row 4 but not the assessment of the economy.  And that is one reason we give so many reasons that inflation prospects may be favorable—the idea that market participants would read this to mean that you are inclined toward tightening but see reasons why you may not have to do much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I want to echo Vince on the question raised by President Pianalto.  If you look at current expectations now and as the Desk survey tells us something about the assumptions behind those expectations (though it’s not a perfect proxy for them), there’s a high probability of a move today, a significant probability that the Committee will decide to move in of assumptions has not led to a significant probability of additional moves beyond May.  That may not be terrifically reassuring against the risk you’ve raised.  The constellation of assumptions in the Desk survey previewed one way of judging what that risk is.  But if you repeat a formulation that’s similar to January’s, are you going to take too much risk that people add to the probability of a third move or a second move beyond today?  I think that risk seems low, but this is essentially unknowable. MS. PIANALTO.  Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Question, President Fisher? MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask Vince a somewhat radical question.  Assuming that the Committee votes to tighten another 25 basis points and the language roughly is what you have in column B, I’m curious as to what you think or maybe Dino and the others think the market reaction would be if we eliminated row 4 in its entirety. MR. REINHART.  My suspicion is that they would think you’re done.  No guidance on interest rates means that you’re not likely to act. MR. FISHER.  So you are saying that we should tip our hand that we want to maintain or we should indicate further policy firming—sort of like President Pianalto’s question. MR. KOS.  I think it is almost impossible to be absolutely neutral.  The choice that you have to make is almost binary. MR. FISHER.  That is what I mean. MR. KOS.  You can take out row 4, and then the market says, “Okay.  They are done.”  Or if you repeat the present language, then it sort of confirms, with a certainty or near certainty, that there will be another move in May and some possibility of another move after that.  I think it is very hard to be purely neutral. MR. REINHART.  Essentially the Committee is repeating its frustration back in 1999, when it immediately published the directive with its announcement and it seemed that the tilt in the directive to the effect that the Committee was more likely to raise rates than lower them was read as more predictive of your future action than many of you wanted.  That is, markets moved to one of the corners and did not view it as a probability statement.  I think you’re in that position again.  I think that one reason we added to the rationale sentence was to contain that risk.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Vince?  Okay.  So let’s begin our policy go-round.  I’m interested to hear your views on policy action, the statement, and anything else you think bears on our decision.  Governor Kohn.   MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we’re getting to the difficult but interesting part of this tightening cycle.  It’s always very difficult to be preemptive and forward looking.  And with rates having risen to where they are, it’s getting harder.  Reacting to the most recent data does risk overshooting, and I think those Taylor rule simulations, the equilibrium funds rate calculations, and alternative B suggest we already have, or are soon to have, a small degree of restraint in the system.   Despite all this, I support raising the funds rate 25 basis points this meeting, and indicating, as in alternative B, that we may have to go further.  I have a number of reasons for leaning on the side of such tightening.  Resource utilization is high.  We don’t know the NAIRU.  It could be lower, due to changes in labor market structure or foreign competition.  But I think we’re in a zone where we need to be very, very cautious about significant further increases in resource utilization.  And I think we need to be presumptive in our policy that we’re damping that down.  Unless we see evidence that it’s okay, unless we see evidence that prices are softening, and unless we see evidence that unit labor costs are particularly well behaved and there isn’t some inflation risk, I think our presumption must be that we need to get this economy slowed to a more sustainable pace.   And I agree with your assessment, Mr. Chairman, of the strength of demand.  I think without further policy increases we do risk rising resource utilization.  There is still considerable strength in final demand.  Some of this could be weather related.  Some of it could be a catch-up from the fourth quarter.  Undoubtedly it is, but we don’t know how much.  And I think the underlying sense is that demand is strong.  What little high-frequency data we have, such as the initial claims for unemployment insurance, suggest that the labor market continues to move right along into early March.  I think that stopping now or indicating that the next move would be the last would cause a rally in financial markets, and we’d be concerned that financial conditions would no longer be consistent with better assurance that the economy is going to glide in here at high levels of resource utilization rather than further increases in resource utilization.   In leaning toward restraint, I also give a little weight to the overall price increases.  We’ve seen several years of rapid price increases in the overall CPI.  There is the issue that President Lacker raised yesterday of these propagating through to core inflation through expectations.  But it is also not entirely clear to me that the core index is the be-all and end-all for public welfare when the real price of energy has risen.  And ignoring total inflation entirely I’m not sure is the right thing to do, if energy prices aren’t going to return to a real mean.  So I give a little weight to total inflation being higher.   Now, I haven’t bought into the comfort zone mantra, at least not yet.  [Laughter]  And I must say I’m a little bothered by the notion that we’re in the high end of the 1 to 2 percent comfort zone when at least three-tenths of that is these nonmarket price increases that grow out of estimations by the BEA.  I’m told that our staff can’t even replicate their estimating procedure.  So quite how much public welfare I want to rest on nonreplicable price calculations, I’m not sure.  I think the market-based PCE is at 1½.  We need to think very carefully about what index we might use if we do go to a comfort zone or a target kind of range.     But at this stage of the cycle, given the strength in demand and high-level resource utilization, I’m convinced we should lean hard against any potential increases in inflation.  And I’m mindful that, because inflation expectations are anchored, the Phillips curve is flat and it will take a while to see inflationary consequences once they start.  I think that, before we stop tightening, we’d want to see a little more evidence that conditions were in place to cool demand.     On the wording of the directive itself, I think that we are moving into a stage at which we’ll need a few more words to explain why we’re doing what we’re doing.  For the last couple of years, the focus has been entirely on the balance-of-risk assessment and the fact that we’ve announced our rate increases and what we’re going to do, and people haven’t paid much attention to the rationale paragraph.  Through this period, policy has been data-dependent to some extent.  But, as we have all said in our speeches, we are becoming more data-dependent.  And as we become more data-dependent, it behooves us to explain to the public what data we’re looking at.  As we go forward from here, we’ll have to think carefully about how to phrase the rationale paragraph to help the public understand what the most important data are.  I expect that importance to change from time to time.   With respect to the specific wording under the revised alternative B, I was glad to see the phrase “appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.”  I think that captures what nearly everybody around the table was saying yesterday.  In terms of productivity gains holding down unit labor costs, I see the inflation process working importantly through the labor market and through labor costs.  I agree that compensation should catch up to productivity at some point.  But I think we can take a bit of comfort from the relatively modest gains in unit labor costs, even making the corrections the Chairman did.  One possible addition to make it more complete would be to say that “ongoing productivity gains and moderate increases in compensation have held the growth of labor costs in check.”  And I agree with the use of “possible increases in resource utilization” because I’m not ready to say that 4.8 or 4.9 is below the NAIRU.  I think that remains to be seen.    And I agree with President Pianalto’s concern that the “may” could cause the markets to build in a little more tightening.  Still, these are the words that seem to me to describe very accurately what I think we should be about:  A little more tightening after today may be needed.  We’re not sure, and the markets will just have to do what the markets do.  We do have the minutes coming out in a couple weeks, which would clarify that.  Sorry to go on so long.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Poole.   MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly favor an increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate.  And I also think that, given what we think we know from our current information about the state of the economy, it’s highly probable that when we come up to our next meeting we will want another 25 basis points.  That’s my view on the basis of the information now available.   I thought the staff discussion of the two-year rate’s reacting relatively little to recent data was quite interesting.  I would make the following observation.  I think that we have had, actually, very few significant data surprises.  And so one reason you don’t get very much is that there hasn’t been a data surprise to which the two-year rate has reacted.  I would note that there was a pretty substantial reaction to Hurricane Katrina because, before the hurricane, the market had baked into it an increase of 25 basis points and then that dropped to a probability of 50 percent, if I recall.  So there was a reaction to the hurricane, and then, as a consequence of statements from Chairman Greenspan, particularly, and others, that came back out of the market.  So that’s not part of the macroeconomic data set that you used in testing this proposition.  I think it makes good sense for the market in recent years, and even the last six months, not to be very reactive to current data, given the forward guidance that’s in the statement and given what we’ve been saying, despite the clause in paragraph 5 of the statement.   It seems to me that, given the background of where we are, given that we would like the economy to continue to move on a good path of growth and for inflation to remain restrained, that we should not alter the statement unless we have a very clear purpose in mind right now.   The time will come when we will alter the statement.  But the market is going to be reading between the lines of anything that we publish.  And so, unless we have a clear purpose in mind by changing some of this language, I would not change it to produce something that we regard as synonymous because the market is going to look at that and say, “Well, they are trying to send us some message.  If they didn’t want to send a different message, why would they be changing the thrust of the language?”  So that’s why my view is that we are going to need further rate increases.   I would also note that if we were operating with a money growth target in a world with minimal money demand disturbances and all of that, we would anticipate that a strong economy would be driving up interest rates.  So if you think that what we’re doing with the federal funds target is trying to replicate what you would get under a money growth system that could work under ideal circumstances, we would expect rates to be going up with a strong economy.  And that’s what I think we have to try to replicate.  So, until we are ready to tell the market that we think that we’re done, we should do practically nothing in terms of the statement because the   I also think that, given the history, should we get a large surprise in the employment data or anything else—let’s say a large downward surprise—the market would probably focus pretty quickly on that paragraph 5 about the Committee’s responding to economic prospects.  As long as we don’t get any significant surprises, the market is not going to react.  And, indeed, we should not want the market to react because, if we continue to get data coming in at or on the high side of expectations, we should be quite pleased that the market is bidding up interest rates because that’s exactly where we’re probably going to want to go under those circumstances.  Thank you.    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Olson.   MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support the ¼ point increase, and I’m persuaded today by the theme I hear repeated that we want to maintain confidence in the Federal Reserve.  I was particularly taken with President Stern’s statement that his read on the people he’s talking to is that the Fed would not allow inflation to get loose.    I wonder about what it would take to contain long-term inflationary expectations.  Clearly it is not simply a U.S. phenomenon because the yield curve and inflationary expectations around the world are very similar.  It seems to me that, in looking at the Taylor construct, we response.  It’s possible to read in one of the charts that the market is anticipating to some extent that we may actually overshoot and come back.  But recognizing the importance of our being diligent with respect to inflation, I think that it’s going to be a much tougher decision next time as to whether or not we should raise.  Dino’s comment about our having a sort of binary decision right now is exactly right.  We ought to maintain the statement that we have.  My preference would be to have taken out the sentence regarding further moves, but I think it’s the right sentence to leave in at this time.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.    MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, this issue of tightening is kind of like Pascal’s wager about the existence of God, and our personal gain–loss ratio as central bankers indicates an answer in the affirmative.  That is, I do think Vice Chairman Geithner made a very good point about expectations and about the expectations of how we will perform our duties.   Despite the question I asked earlier about row 4, I am in favor of further tightening.  I am in favor because I believe that the tightening that we’ve done, although we don’t yet have answers to the question we’ve asked about lags, doesn’t seem to have done much harm in terms of slowing the pace of economic expansion.  I would like to build a reserve that we can then subtract from if we need to respond to weakness.  And so I am in favor of tightening, and I am in favor of continued tightening because (1) it seems not to be doing great damage to economic growth, which is stout, (2) I’d like to have something to give back when we see weakness, and (3) I’d like to ward off inflation.     I have only one request on the wording, and that is that we insert the word “global” before “resource utilization.”  [Laughter]  Thank you.  I never give up.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Had to put that in there.  [Laughter]  President Hoenig.   MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a slightly different view.  I would go with A.  I wouldn’t dissent over it if I were a voting member, but I would push very hard for signaling that we are just about at the end.  And here is a bit of my reasoning.  I think we are at or in the area of equilibrium in terms of the fed funds rate.  Perhaps we’re even at the upper end.  I know we can’t observe what the equilibrium rate is, but then we can’t observe the NAIRU either, and we tend to put a lot of weight on that.  If we believe our projections—the Greenbook or our own projections—I suggest we are moving back toward trend, even without further actions.  Then I think we are where we need to be.  If we believe the Greenbook that we need to raise the rate and then come back down, then we are about where we need to be.   So I think that’s important to keep in mind.  Also, probably most in this room have said at one time or another that monetary policy acts with a lag, but we never believe it.  And here we are, we’ve tightened for how long?  We recently tightened again.  We are at a point at which we say there aren’t really inflationary pressures, and yet we have tightened up.  The outlook is that we would move to trend, and yet we haven’t had the full effects of our recent tightenings.  The fourth quarter was weak but for transitory reasons; and the first quarter bump-up was a bounceback for the weak fourth quarter, and we’re heading toward trend.  I think we are where we need to be, and we need to be patient about that.  And about whether we move again—we ought to have our language say that we are not moving but that we may if the data come in stronger than we anticipated and than our own projections suggest they would.   So here we are anxious again about it.  The economy is strong.  We’ve heard it’s strong.  And yet we don’t believe that it will taper off, so we’ve got to do something about it.  And that is our history—always going too far.  I think that’s what we’re in danger of.  Whether we go to 4¾ percent today is not the issue.  The issue is that we are about where we should be, and if we’re going to signal something, that’s what we should be signaling to the market.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.   MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m reasonably comfortable with the stability of inflation and inflation expectations right now.  But, frankly, they’re a little on the high side for my taste, and I say this with due appreciation of the calculation problems that Governor Kohn alluded to.  The expected CPI and the term spreads are running around 2½ percent.  That seems high to me, but I’d be open to persuasion if the staff had information that there was some inherent bias, that we shouldn’t take that as the center point estimate of the distribution of the true rate of increase there.   In thinking about the policy decision today, I judge that the public’s expectation of our moving once after today and then taking a break, given the current state of the economy and the near-term outlook, is pretty reasonable.  But in thinking through the decision we are facing or are going to face in the next couple of months about deciding where to stop, I find myself casting about for ways to gauge what short-term real rates are going to need to be on a sustained basis going forward.  If you look back at the late ’90s—another period of sustained, fairly balanced growth—two more ¼ point moves are going to put us at the lower end of the real rates we saw back then.  And taking that together with a sense that the world economy is strengthening now and inflation is a touch on the high side suggests that further moves beyond 5 percent might be necessary.  On the other hand, forward short real rates are remarkably low, and that suggests that price stability might require lower real rates than we otherwise would have thought.  We might have to come back down below 5 percent later on, as the market expects.  But if I had to bet, I’d bet on the first risk rather than the latter.  In any event, I’d be happier moving market expectations in the direction of the lower ultimate expected inflation rate, even if that meant somewhat higher expected short real rates.   I’ll repeat something I’ve said before and then comment on something Don said and something Vince said.  I agree with Governor Kohn that, when we do reach a resting point, we should be careful to communicate in such a way that the public doesn’t place too much probability on our staying fixed for a long period of time.  Vince said that he is finding evidence that the markets are looking to us rather than to the data, and perhaps it’s the case that uncertainty about our intentions is distracting markets from reacting to the incoming data.  I just mention this in the context of row 4.  The logic of the balance-of-risk assessment is not to express our intentions or express what we’re going to do with policy, really, but to sort of ask the public to reverse-engineer things from our signal about what we’re going to do with interest rates a couple of months ahead.   It strikes me that, when we get around to reconsidering the statement later this year, it would be useful to step back from that whole logic and think it through on a more fundamental basis.  I think it would be preferable for the public to understand our intentions and for reactions to the data to come in on that basis rather than for them to be hanging onto our words about our intentions going forward.  But that’s something that I’m sure we’ll work to clear up over time.  So I’m fine with the statement as it is, theorizing and all, and I’m happy with the decision in alternative B.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern.    MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just comment on a few things.  First of all, I support increasing the federal funds rate another ¼ percentage point today.  I think that’s consistent with the Greenbook forecast, with which I’m comfortable, and it’s clearly what participants.   In thinking about policy strategy going forward, I guess what interests me the most, and concerns me the most, is June rather than May.  There’s a high likelihood, and clearly the get ourselves some more flexibility and some more wiggle room come June.  So I think exactly what we say and how we say it are going to matter here.  Having said that, it’s not easy to have a big impact, it seems to me, on what people might expect for June without going further than I feel comfortable in saying that we’re about to stop or we will stop after one more increase.  I do think that it might help, at least on the margin, to adopt paragraph 5 from alternative A for the reasons that Vincent pointed out.  Getting people to focus more on the data and less on what we   The only other thing I would add is—and I realize I’m in the minority on this—that I’m not altogether comfortable with this constant reference to resource utilization.  As you know, I’m not a big fan of the NAIRU concept.  I’m not comfortable with the empirical work there, and I take President Fisher’s point that in an increasingly global economy we need to be a little careful about thinking too narrowly about this.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.   MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I said yesterday, the Greenbook baseline captures the broad contours of my expectations—namely, solid growth going forward and projections for inflation moving downward over the forecast period.  But that baseline is broadly the same forecast that we received in January, and in January it was supported by a 4.75 percent funds rate.  Obviously, this Greenbook has that same outcome being supported by a 5 percent funds rate.   Based on the incoming reports that I received from my District contacts, my guess is that the January forecast was about right.  So I do fully support another 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate today.  But then, that leaves open, obviously, as others have said, whether it’s going to prove necessary to move to 5 percent or higher and how we communicate that.   As I mentioned yesterday, my impression is that the Greenbook is showing pressures in the labor market, and that was one of the central reasons for moving the fed funds path upward to get the same inflation outlook.  Because I’m not seeing those same pressures, I’m inclined to believe that a 25 basis point move today roughly balances the upside and downside forecast risk for inflation.  Therefore, I could support leaving this meeting with the presumption that the rate hike today is more than likely the last one for a while.     Now, having said that, I am sensitive to the distinctions between a forecast risk and a policy risk.  And although I see the risk to the forecast, particularly the inflation forecast, as relatively balanced at a 4¾ percent funds rate, I’m not averse to taking out some additional insurance in case there is an upside risk or a surprise on the upside in inflation, because core inflation is currently running at a rate higher than I want to see.   So that leads me to think not so much about this meeting or even the May meeting but, as others have said, about the June meeting.  As we discussed earlier, my concern is that having no change in the assessment-of-risk language today is going to reinforce the expectations that there will be another 25 basis point increase in May, and I’m a little concerned that it will also lead to an expectation of an additional 25 basis point increase in June.  When my staff looks at the distribution of market expectations based on options on fed funds futures, in the week or so following our last meeting there was a movement up, but not because the data came in unexpectedly high.  The data came in where they were expected, but the fed funds options did move up.  I’m concerned that we’re going to see a similar pattern after this meeting if we don’t make some changes to the language.  But given Governor Kohn’s comments and some of the others, the minutes can help us with that.  Our statements can certainly also help us convey that.   Given my concern, though, I have to say that I was interested in the language that was suggested in the Bluebook by Vincent—that we modify our statement in section 4 just slightly to say that some additional firming may be needed.  However, given people’s comments today, I can live with keeping section 4 language the same and accept some of the changes that Vincent has laid out in alternative B, but I suggest that we then use our minutes and our statements if we’re starting to see too much movement in market expectations about where we’re going to go.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Stone.   MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support a ¼ point increase in the federal funds rate.  I think, as we said yesterday, the risks to growth are balanced.  Risks to inflation are moderately tilted to the upside, with core inflation near the top of the range that I feel comfortable with.  Any positive aggregate demand shock could send inflation higher than we’d like.  I think that the Committee is probably close to the end of a tightening cycle, whether it’s 25 basis points or 50 basis points away.  In looking at those risks, I think that there is a greater risk to ending hikes at a level that turns out to be too low than the risk of ending at a level that turns out to be a little too high.   I support the language in alternative B.  I am a bit concerned about the interpretation that may say that the expectations are for two more increases.  I came in today supporting the final language that came out in alternative B after the modifications.  I now think it’s important to keep the word “possible” in the language because, if we take that out, people may almost certainly believe that we’re looking at greater concerns about inflation than I think we’ve indicated in our discussion.  So it’s important to keep the word “possible” in the discussions, and I would keep the rest of the language the same.  But certainly in the future the phrasing is going to be very important, particularly at the May meeting.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I much appreciated the change in the format of the meeting whereby you summarized the general points of agreement yesterday and gave your own sense of the outlook.  I thought that was a helpful change and something that was quite useful to me.  I know that, as I sat down early this morning to think about my own policy prescription, given everything we have been looking at and talking about and the discussion yesterday, I was struck by how good the near-term outlook looks.  Clearly there are risks to both growth and inflation from a number of different forces.  But to borrow Vice Chairman Geithner’s language from yesterday, there does seem to be a good probability that the trajectory for the economy is one of an orderly transition.  I like that—“ orderly transition” from a higher rate of growth to a somewhat slower rate of growth, less potential for price pressures, and continued solid performance.   So I think that that is a fabulous place in which to be.  The question I ask myself is how best can policy, both what we do and what we say about it, ensure that outcome or give that outcome the best chance of happening.  I find myself a bit between President Hoenig and President Lacker on this—and to some extent President Pianalto, too.  I think there is something to recommend about being able to say that we are either ready to stop now after this 25 basis points or we soon will be.  The question is how to do it.  How to say that, to me, is a difficult problem.  President Hoenig made a good point about our forecasts saying that we are going to go up 25 basis points now, another 25 points at the next meeting, and then six months or so later back down another 25.  That does seem to say to me that, over the period in which monetary policy usually works, maybe we will be in about the right place with this 25 basis points. I am in favor of a 25 basis point move because I do think there are some slight upside risks for inflation in staying at 4½, and it is a matter of risk management—almost like President Pianalto’s concerns about insurance.  As a matter of risk management, another small move upward is a good idea.  That is encompassed in both alternative B and alternative C.  I much prefer B because it does have a more balanced discussion of risks. Now, what I could clearly see doing is taking four and five in the assessment of risk from alternative A and putting those in alternative B and basically saying to people, “There is a chance that we are where we need to be.  We are going to watch the data, and we are not giving you a solid take on what the next meeting will be.”  I know there are people who believe that conveying that would provoke too great a market reaction.  Maybe that is true, but I still think at some point and some point soon, May perhaps and certainly June, we are going to have to figure out a way to say that we are stopping and we are not giving you future guidance because we don’t know what future guidance to give you.  We don’t have any clearer crystal ball than the rest of you do, and frankly, we would like to see what yours is saying rather than simply getting feedback about what you think ours is saying. So I am in favor of B.  I could graft on four and five from A.  I take the point that I think some of you would make, some of you have already made, that that might provoke too great a reaction from the market and increase the upside risk to growth and, given where we are in terms of resource utilization, possibly unhinge inflation expectations, although I don’t give that a high probability.  But it could produce a bit of market turmoil.  Maybe we don’t need it. I am a little concerned that we are a bit more hostage to the markets’ understanding of us than I am really comfortable with.  I would rather do what we need to do and let them figure out how to get used to it rather than constantly having to modify what we do based on what they think we are telling them that we are going to do.  And I am looking forward to the day when we are a little bit clearer about all of that.  For the time being, I can go with B the way it is.  I kind of like the language that is the alternative language mentioned in one of the paragraphs in the Bluebook, but it is really hard to get into wordsmithing even early in the morning on the second day of the meeting.  [Laughter]   So I am okay with B.  I am not a voting member, but I wouldn’t dissent over the language even if I were.  But I really do look forward to being able to say, either in May or in June, “We are done.  We are going to be looking at the data.  You tell us what you think we ought to be doing.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, favor a 25 basis point increase in our funds rate target today, and with that move and based on discussion that we had yesterday and this morning, I judge that we are close to being balanced.  However, even at the point of presumed balance, I remind myself that a negative surprise on inflation would be more worrisome to me than a negative surprise on growth, and that suggests to me that we do want, as best we can judge, to have a slightly restrictive policy stance.  I believe we are close to being at that point. I also share the concerns expressed by Sandy Pianalto in her question and Cathy and Gary in their comments that I wish we could find some words that would be a little less precise in terms of this future guidance because I do think, like others, that we are at a point where it is not terribly helpful to us or to the markets to have them likely build in two more moves after this one.  I’m not as sure as others that that is where we want to be.  I like Cathy’s characterization of being hostage to have a word to suggest, but I wish we could find a way in line 4 to convey something other than two more moves after this one. I am also less attracted than others to adding a lot more words to the statement for a couple of reasons.  First of all, as I listened to the discussion yesterday, I thought that we have some different views around the table in terms of what we are watching and what we think, and I do not know whether it is possible to construct a whole bunch of words that capture the Committee sense.  And if it is a Committee statement, I think it is important that it reflect the Committee.  I also would observe that if we are going to have a fundamental discussion of the construct of the statement, it might not be helpful to get ourselves to a point where we have added lots and lots and lots of words now and have to back away from that.  It would be much easier, it seems to me, to stay as simple and as close to where we have been as possible, with the option of expanding the statement later rather than trying to go back the other way. I also want to lobby for the little, seemingly harmless cell in line 5 under alternative A.  I would like to see those new words substituted for what we used at the last couple of meetings in whatever alternative we come up with.  I think that not only would they cause people to focus more sharply on the fact that they need to think with us about the data we’re seeing, but that they actually construct a different sense.  The words would, I hope, cause people not to whiplash with every single piece of data that comes out but would emphasize that it affects the “economic outlook.”  I think that’s a better way to say that than what we have been saying in the past.  So I would make that change in any event.  I think that is as much as I want to say.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think overall we are in a good position at this point with the economy essentially at full employment and growth homing in on potential, which will, I hope, hold unemployment roughly steady.  Core inflation is pretty steady although, at least by several measures and particularly the core PCE, it is in the top half of the range that I would like to see.  But I agree with Governor Kohn that this is a matter that we should consider.  What index, and where it is relative to what we would like, bears further thinking about.  If you take inflation to be in the top half of a comfort range as opposed to the middle, an optimal policy setting would place the funds rate toward the upper end of a neutral range or would be minimally restrictive.  I say “minimally” because we are at most a little above the middle of the so-called comfort range and also because the various rules presented in chart 7 of the Bluebook suggest that the appropriate response of policy to a deviation of inflation from the middle of the range is actually quite small. If inflation were to decline, say, 50 basis points, from 2 percent to 1½ percent, the response, according to most of the rules in the table, of the fed funds rate to that deviation is on the order of 25 or 30 basis points.  So it is sort of a one-policy-move difference.  At this point, it seems to me, policy is pretty close to appropriately positioned. In terms of risk assessments, I share Governor Kohn’s concern about the possibility that growth won’t actually slow to a sustainable pace and so the economy may overheat.  But I am also concerned about overshooting, in part because the delayed effect of our policy actions may show up especially in the housing sector with greater force than we expect and we are a little uncertain—David mentioned this yesterday—about just what the spillovers might be to consumer spending via balance sheet effects or wealth effects.  I think we do need to be sensitive to the possibility of overshooting, and here I would endorse President Hoenig’s comments on that.  So I can certainly support a 25 basis point tightening today coupled with some slight policy inclination for further firming.  But I would not like to do anything to boost the market’s perceptions of the likely ending point of the cycle.  I’m not sure what the best way is to accomplish that.  I had first found myself having some preference for using the alternative language suggested for B that would say that some modest additional policy firming may be needed.  But I am not sure that is the right way to go. As I look forward, I share the concern that a number of you have expressed—that as we get to the May meeting we are going to find not only that markets expect us to go another 25 but also that an additional 25 will be priced into the market.  And it seems to me that the construction of our statement raises the likelihood that markets are going to continue to build in expectations for moves beyond 5 percent.  Let me explain in part what I’m worried about.  I am worried about the way in which line 3 of alternative B characterizes our concerns about energy and commodity prices.  As I looked at the new Bluebook handout that Vince just gave us, I liked the change that has been made in line 2 where it says that the economic growth has rebounded but in effect then adds, “But look, in our Committee forecast, we wanted to let you know we’re expecting really strong numbers for Q1, but we think it is then going to moderate to a more-sustainable pace.” Now, we might have tried to do the same thing in line 3, but unfortunately we didn’t.  We don’t state what our forecast is to give markets a reasonable way to judge incoming data.  Let me get a bit more specific about what I mean.  Consider the Greenbook forecast for core PCE inflation for the remainder of this year.  I’m more optimistic than the Greenbook is, but the Greenbook forecast is that, for the remainder of this year, core PCE inflation is going to come in at 2.2 percent, which is certainly above the top end of the comfort range that I or anyone else who has opined on this has suggested. So what will the market response be if the Greenbook forecast actually materializes?  It seems to me that the Greenbook projects that the uptick would be temporary, so we needn’t respond.  But the statement in B essentially says, “Look.  The run-up in energy prices has had only a modest effect on core inflation.”  In effect, it says we continue to think that that will be the way the world transpires, and in the end I think it says that we regard it as an upside risk to our forecast that elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressure.  So if, in point of fact, the Greenbook is right and we start seeing 2.2 for core PCE, what will markets conclude?  “Yes, this is what they’re worried about.  They’re really worried that an upside risk to their inflation forecast is that inflation is going to come in this high.  What are we to conclude other than that this is a negative surprise to the Committee, and therefore they are going to go above 5 percent?”  So we have told market participants in line 2, “Don’t be surprised if you see a very strong growth number in Q1.  We think that’s temporary.  It’s going to abate.”  What we haven’t told next couple of quarters, but we think it is temporary. One thing that we could do would be to change the phrasing and say in line 3 that the elevated prices of energy and other commodities may boost core inflation modestly for a time.  That would distinguish this from the case of rising inflation due to resource utilization, which we do see as an upside risk to our forecast.  But generally whether or not we make this change, I am concerned that we are going to see more increases priced into fed funds futures, and I would cheerfully endorse the kind of move that has been made in this draft of alternative B, in which the Committee’s forecast for growth has been clearly enunciated.  And moving in that direction for our baseline forecast for inflation would be a useful way to go as well. If I could just spend one more second, I would like to propose a bit more wordsmithing in alternative B.  A principle, or a practice, that I learned at the Council of Economic Advisers that I think would be a good one for us is that you never make a statement that purports to be a statement of fact unless it can be fact-checked.  [Laughter]  This process is rigorous there.  I would say the first statement in line 3—“as yet the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities has had only a modest effect on core inflation”—is not fact-checkable.  I believe that’s the case.  I think most of you believe that’s the case.  I wouldn’t want to have to fact-check it.  I don’t know how you would do it.  I would add something like “has apparently had only a modest effect on core inflation.”  The point about the fact that productivity gains have held the growth of unit labor costs in check, I don’t personally mind that at all.  I agree with that.  I simply think that it is not the only thing—arithmetically modest compensation gains have done the same thing.  So I do not mind listing it, but I would say “have helped.”   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  It is 11 o’clock.  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for a coffee break? [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow, are you ready? MR. MOSKOW.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the 25 basis point increase and the language in alternative B.  I do not think this is the time to keep our rates at the current level, and I don’t think it’s the time for us to give a signal that we are about to stop.  The likelihood is that we will probably have to go to 5 percent, but we do not know.  As we said all along, it is going to depend on the data. The second point I would make is that this will make fourteen consecutive 25 basis point increases in the fed funds rate.  So we have known for a long time, as we have gone down this path, that when we wanted to stop or we thought we would want to stop we would have to give a signal to the market.  And I do not think this is the time to do it now.  Maybe in May it will be.  Again, it will all depend on the data whether we will want to stop in May, but that is the time that we would give a clear signal to the market. Now, if the market gets ahead of us, as some have been concerned about here, in the past the Chairman of this Committee has given a signal of some sort between meetings, and we have always had that option.  The Chairman always has that option.  Some people have raised the question about whether we are hostage to the market.  I personally don’t feel we are hostage to the market at all.  At some point the market will have to live with our decision, and if we are going to do something that is different from what the market expects, so be it.  But I certainly do not think that this Committee is being held hostage to the market. On the statement, I thought Bill Poole’s philosophy of minimum changes until we are ready to give a different signal is a very good philosophy, and in that regard I would say two things.  First, some people have suggested possibly tweaking number five, and I just do not see the real benefit of doing that.  That this may help change some expectations is a very subtle psychological point, and I certainly would not want to go to the bank on that.  We are much better off staying the way we are.  Now, having said that, I bring up the word “possible,” which comes around and bites me in the tail a bit because we did have “possible” in the January FOMC statement.  So I’ll fold my tent on that.  [Laughter]  I think we are free to use the word “possible” there in the interest of consistency.  Second, on the statement itself:  In the earlier version that was circulated to the Committee, some specific data were referred to, and someone made the comment here that it is important for us to explain to the public what data we are thinking about.  I forget who said that.  But I really agree with short as possible and then use the minutes for that purpose.  The minutes, again, come out three weeks after the meeting.  We have accelerated them.  We also use speeches, but certainly the minutes are a perfect vehicle for elaborating on the statement itself.  And I think that philosophy is a very good one. Then I just wanted to say a few words about inflation and Fed credibility.  We are all very pleased with the low inflation numbers that we have seen so far, and a number of people have mentioned the importance of Fed credibility and keeping inflation low.  As we know, the Greenbook forecast has core inflation going up above 2 percent, and I think we don’t know exactly how long it would stay at that.  We do not know if it is going to go above 2 percent, and we don’t know how long it is going to stay above that level.  But I am uncertain myself as to how long it could stay above 2 percent without having an impact on inflationary expectations.  This is just something we have to take into account and say we want to be vigilant about.  There is a lot of uncertainty here.  We just have to keep monitoring it. In terms of the real economy, the best forecast is that growth will be near potential or higher this year.  So I think we definitely want to maintain as much flexibility as possible in our statement now to allow for the possibility that we may want to move even higher than the Greenbook assumptions in the future.  Again, it is going to depend on the data, as we have all said, and we just do not know at this point, and I think the language in alternative B gives us this leeway. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  We have a two-hander. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, I’m sorry.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I don’t know whether this is fair or not. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Absolutely. MR. POOLE.  I have a proposal to offer here that makes use of the minutes, as Michael suggests.  We make our statement after this meeting with minimal change and then use the minutes to say four things.  One, the Committee believes that, after May, accommodation will have been largely removed.  Two, policy will be responsive to the data.  In the light of that, three, if the economy remains strong and inflation risks remain a concern, some further rate increases may be necessary depending on the data.  Four, data indicating that inflation risks are receding would lead most likely to the policy rate remaining unchanged. If we said that, we could then at the next meeting essentially do away with sentences 4 and 5 in the policy statement.  We would have found a way to exit from the forward guidance that has been in the statement.  And then along the way, if the data come in suggesting that further policy tightening is appropriate, we use the minutes to indicate why the rate changes, but we have mostly gotten out of the forward guidance.  So here is a specific proposal to try to explain this in the minutes with as much clarity as we possibly can. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m in support of a 25 basis point increase today.  I am favoring alternative B, but I want to make some comments about the wording. One of the things I am struggling with, in addition to some of the points everybody has made around the table, is the apparent presence of a tremendous amount of liquidity in the markets.  I look at how much we have raised rates, but the fact that there is so much out there that the banks are trying to lend and that other markets are trying to invest tells me that there is a lot of liquidity.  I think that the liquidity pressures are an inflationary risk, and that is something that will influence my not comfortable saying we are there yet. The second thing I would like to point out is that I like President Guynn’s new beard, [laughter] but I also support his recommendation to look more closely at alternative A, line 5.  One of the reasons I like A-5 or something along that line is the use of words like “evolution” and “implied by incoming information.”  Compared with what we now have in line 5, these words give a different tone—that we are looking at a slow-moving set of data coming in, not one piece of data and not one series of data.  As in every meeting, I heard around the table today that, given the monthly volatility in all the series we look at, all of us are taking all of these together.  We are smoothing through one-month blips, and words that are closer to “evolution” than to “change” give us a better sense that we are looking at the whole tone of information coming in.  I would like us to move down that path going forward.  I can stick with the wording today, but I think that that kind of approach may make people less dependent on one series of data in one month in the release. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate target.  Obviously the question that we are dealing with now is not just optimal monetary policy but also optimal information disclosure and optimal communication policy.  There are a lot of moving parts right now, a lot of changes, and so for the moment, I would probably favor being leaner rather than fuller in descriptions even if we decided to go forward in the longer run with fuller descriptions, which I think is perfectly reasonable. As has been described, there are a lot of alternatives—not just the statement but also the minutes.  There are speeches, and speeches on communications could be given specifically.  There are also background sessions with key players in the journalism community and elsewhere.  So I think that something on the order of B or even a slimmed-down B would be most appropriate at the moment.  I would not lean toward going to something like A-5 yet.  That may provide us with a very good basis for thinking about what we might want to do next time.  So I applaud Vincent and others who helped to create alternative A, in some sense a way to get us thinking about where we might be moving and some of the costs and benefits of doing that.  But particularly given that I have heard somewhat different views from Committee members about where they, given current data and current Greenbook projections, would be likely to go, I do not think we want to signal something too clear at the moment. Also, we have had some discussions about whether or not we can take back 25 basis points.  I don’t really see the economy as being on such a knife edge that we will know that it’s exactly 5 or exactly 4¾ or exactly 5¼.  I think it is highly unlikely that we go to 5¼ and get information that we know that we have gone exactly 25 basis points too much and have to have a retrenchment.  It is more likely that the economy would evolve and then we would think that things had really moved in a different direction, and if we were to have to move down the line, it would be more than a 25 basis point move.  Historically that has been typical, although not always the case, and has been true both in the United States and elsewhere.  So we should not overemphasize that we will get it exactly right and that we will know exactly where we will be.  We have to be in a comfort zone not only on inflation but also in terms of where our target rate is.  It is useful to think in those kinds of terms about where we will be going and also to realize that retrenchments are unlikely to be the sort that a few months later we take back a little even if that’s what the market may be predicting.  But I leave that to others who may have much more experience in that; maybe my view is a little naïve. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate and would just like to make a couple of points about the market and market expectations. It does strike me as a particularly inopportune time to miss market expectations.  Given the changes in the economy that we have discussed over the last day and a half, particularly a slowdown in housing, potentially some growth in the business side, increased expectations of growth overseas, and, to be candid, the changes here at the Federal Reserve, it strikes me that we should be taking incremental steps both in terms of message changes and in terms of the sorts of statements we have.  So this would be, I think, a very successful meeting if everyone yawned at the statement and the An issue was raised about whether we’re leading the market or the market is leading us.  It strikes me that the markets—and I particularly have in mind traders down on the floor—are looking to us because I think they’re also confused, and so they don’t know where else to look.  This is sort of a safe place for them to cast their eyes and sharpen their pencils.  I hope, over the course of the clearer crystal ball and that they will be looking both to us and to some other data points to inform their thinking.  But right now, I think their sense of things is fairly cloudy.  So with that, we have a particularly large burden of presumption in figuring out whether we make changes to what was done in January. A final point on markets and the ownership of the statement, Mr. Chairman, which you referenced earlier:  The typical trader in these markets doesn’t fully appreciate what we’re voting on and the entirety of this statement, and my own view is that’s a little more than would be ideal to be aired in the public forum.  For traders to be reading one paragraph and saying, “Oh, that’s Chairman Bernanke,” and to be reading the other paragraphs and saying, “Well, that’s the consensus of the Committee,” strikes me as inviting into their debate a little too much interpretation beyond the data set.  So I think our discussion going forward in terms of who owns what would probably best be carried out in the same close confidence that previous discussions here were. Finally, in keeping with the suggestion that I think President Poole made about our making as few changes as possible to the January statement at present, the only wordsmithing I would offer in alternative B is the first two words of section 3: “as yet.”  I’m trying to show as much congruence as possible with the January statement, and so when I see key words like “still” in alternative B, I think that’s roughly equivalent to “nevertheless.”  But “as yet” really is borrowed in some ways from alternative C, which suggests to me almost an inevitability.  That is, we expect inflation to be coming.  “As yet” we don’t see it, but it is almost inevitable.  And it strikes me that the “as yet” words are potentially market-moving words and that they will perhaps suggest more vigilance regarding inflation, more concern about inflation expectations than we had only a couple of months ago.  So the minor suggestion might be to strike the words “as yet” and continue with alternative B as written before us, and that in either regard I firmly support. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we really do have a remarkable degree of consensus around the table about the forecast, and you did a very nice job of capturing that consensus.  The consensus is really quite close to the Greenbook, closer than it has been perhaps in recent meetings.  The Greenbook forecast is conditioned on a monetary policy assumption that has us essentially stopping at 5 with the path pretty flat from 5 on. The question, of course, for us today is whether we want to alter current market expectations about the path of policy, and I think it is hard to find a compelling case to do so, either from what we discussed around the table or from what the Greenbook provided.  The Bluebook provided alternative prisms to look at the implications of past policy.  The presumption is that we don’t want to change expectations substantially because we don’t see a case for changing the current stance of monetary policy as embodied in those expectations.  The question is how best to do it, and I think B is probably the closest we’re going to get to that. I agree with the concern that Sandy began with and which I think Dino echoed—that there is some possibility, maybe even a likelihood, that B is interpreted as raising the probability of not just a move in May but a move beyond May.  Again, I don’t see any need to do that.  I don’t think it should be our objective to try to raise the probability around June.  The question really is how to avoid that.  I do think that adding the sustainable growth reference in the second row and adding “possible,” as Vince explained, helps against that risk, but it probably doesn’t take away all of that risk.  The problem with doing things that create the risk of pushing down the curve is that people would react to that by saying, “Well, what does that mean about how confident they are about the strength of underlying demand growth?”  One consequence of an alternative that would be designed to push down that curve would be, in some sense, questions raised about how confident we are in our forecast about the underlying strength of demand growth, which I don’t think that we have a basis for signaling at this point. Is there some risk we are going to go too far?  Of course there is.  What are the best tools we have to assess that risk?  Again, I think the Greenbook and the Bluebook give us a number of tools to assess that risk; and if the Greenbook forecast, with a monetary policy path close to what’s priced in the markets, showed a different trajectory of output growth and a different trajectory of inflation, then there would be more substantial reason for us to be concerned that the path that’s roughly priced in now creates too much risk that we would be pushing demand growth below potential over the period.  And, again, I think it is hard to say that.  It has been said that the output-based policy rules we use aren’t a particularly good reason to be concerned about that because of the way they are constructed. Are we too hostage to the markets in our current approach?  I think that is always something to be worried about.  Again, the best check against that risk is to look at the implications of these alternative policy paths for the forecast.  I think it’s hard to find in the range of paths that the staff has given us significant justification for concern against that risk today. So I would support moving 25 today; and for the reasons discussed, I think B does a pretty good job of capturing the basic objective of a signal that’s fairly neutral to expectations.  I’d rather take the risk at the margin that we’re pushing it up a bit than the risk that we end up pushing it down. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thank you for this very helpful conversation.  It helps inform today’s decision and also helps inform how we will be thinking about policy for the next few meetings. As I discussed, I see the economy as still being basically quite strong, and it needs to moderate to become consistent with its long-run potential.  The vehicle by which that is going to happen is the slowing in the housing market.  I think we ought to raise the rate today and not to signal an immediate end for several reasons.  First, we could think of our policy in terms of the mortgage rate rather than the funds rate.  The mortgage rate is currently about the same as it was when we began tightening in June 2004, and it is still providing support to the housing market.  If we failed to act today or signaled that we are definitely done, we would create a rally in the long-term bond market and in the mortgage market.  We would create, I think, some risk of re-igniting what is currently a cooling market.  I think that would be a mistake.  Second, I talked, as many of us did, about the small but nevertheless probable risk that inflation will rise slightly in the next few quarters and the potential costs of that to our credibility and to our future policy need to respond to higher inflation.   So my recommendation to the Committee is that we raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points today.  We are circulating, and you have received, a draft statement that is very close to option B, which I’ll discuss in just a moment.  What I would like to emphasize is that section 4, which says that policy firming may be needed is in fact a flexible statement, and I think it’s entirely possible, depending on the intervening data and the evolution of the economy, that we may choose to signal a halt or even to not move in May.  It depends very much on what we see in the housing create significant flexibility. A couple of other comments.  First, I realize that there are arguments on both sides about expanding even modestly the language in the rationale.  I think this language is not more explicit or lengthier than the language we have seen in some statements that this Committee has issued in the past few years.  It has the benefit in this particular case of slightly moderating the hawkish tone of the statement and of acknowledging that we see, for example, the economy to be returning to a sustainable pace.  So I think it does serve some purpose, and I think it is worth including.  I appreciate President Poole’s suggestion, but I do not think that the minutes and the statement are perfect substitutes.  The statement, after all, is much more timely, and it represents something closer to a consensus or a median view of the Committee as opposed to the minutes, which try to express the range of views and discussion around the table. One other suggestion about retaining or taking part 5 from statement A.  I see the arguments on both sides.  But I think the sense around the table is that the change was not sufficient to justify the innovation to the January statement, and so I think we ought to stay with the January language. If you look at the statement, it is very close to B.  We did make a couple of changes suggested by President Yellen, which I think clarify what we are trying to say—in particular, in the middle paragraph:  “the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have” (Are the subject and the verb mismatched?)—“the run-up . . . appears to have only a modest effect,” and “productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check.”  So we are obviously not ruling out other influences that are important.  So that is my proposal—that we move 25 basis points today, that we issue the statement you have before you, and that we watch very carefully the data during the intermeeting period.  The Bluebook presented a number of options—types of language that would allow us to pause, to pause with an upward bias, to move and pause, various combinations.  So I think we do have quite a bit of flexibility when we come back to meet in May. We have already had a policy go-round.  So I don’t want to do that all again, but if there is anyone who particularly would like to comment, here’s your chance.  Yes, President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I agree with the statement.  But just on President Poole’s suggestion for putting those four points in the minutes, I want to say that I don’t think we should do it.  I don’t know what the process here would be.  I mean, I don’t think we should say that the accommodation has been largely removed in the minutes, which will come out three weeks after this meeting and three weeks before the May meeting.  I don’t see any benefit to it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It illustrates the difference between the minutes and the statement.  The statement is a consensus view or at least a median view.  The minutes should express the range of opinion and would include that view but perhaps other views as well.  Are there any other comments?  Are we ready for a vote? MS. DANKER.  I will read the directive wording from page 25 of the Bluebook.  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4¾ percent.” And now the risk assessment from the statement that was just handed out:  “The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.” Chairman Bernanke   Vice Chairman Geithner Governor Bies President Guynn Governor Kohn Governor Kroszner President Lacker Governor Olson President Pianalto Governor Warsh President Yellen          Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  We need to take an action.  There will be a short break. [Recess] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  We would like to return to the meeting and discuss briefly the format of today’s meeting, and also we need to make a few decisions about what we’re going to do in May.  Debbie is going to introduce the discussion. MS. DANKER.3  The next item on the agenda calls for us to address the date of the next meeting, which the Chairman has indicated that he wishes to confirm for Wednesday, May 10.  More broadly, however, this is an opportunity, while memories                                                  3 The materials used by Ms. Danker are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). are still very fresh, to review the experience of this meeting and to think about possible enhancements to the format of future meetings.  In the past for the FOMC, various formats have been used.  Just for example, in terms of the two-day schedule, the FOMC introduced two-day meetings back in 1972 because it felt that it needed additional time every so often to take a longer-term perspective on policy.  Thus, during the mid-1970s, when the Committee was meeting about monthly, three or four or as many as five of those meetings each year were two-day affairs.  More recently, since 1990, the Committee has consistently held two two-day meetings each year, scheduled to coincide with the Federal Reserve’s semiannual report to the Congress.  To help focus your comments about the current meeting, we distributed at the break a list of questions you may wish to address in any comments you may have.  Before hearing those comments, though, I want to mention what I think is the baseline assumption about the path forward after today regarding the meeting schedule.  First, the Committee will meet for one day next time, just as originally planned, because the timing of international meetings in May makes it difficult to turn that meeting into a two-day one.  Of course, if it would be helpful, that May meeting could be scheduled to begin a little early, say 8:30 in the morning, to give you additional time.  Then, in June, the Committee already has a two-day meeting scheduled.  At that point, having had some more experience with this format, the Committee might be prepared to decide whether to shift most of its remaining 2006 meetings to a two-day format.  As Vincent’s memo from earlier this month pointed out, your September meeting will have to be confined to one day, again largely because of the international meeting schedule.  But the August, the October, and the  Around the time of the June meeting each year is when we would typically be publishing the tentative schedule for meetings for the following year—for 2007, in this case.  But that announcement could always be delayed a little this year to allow for time to decide on the usefulness of the two-day format, and any changes to the 2006 schedule could then be announced at the same time.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re open for comments on the format or suggestions for the future.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  I like what we did—there’s a lot to like about the last two days.  I think we ought to give ourselves several two-day meetings and see if we can get really comfortable with the notion.  I certainly felt more comfortable.  I detected comfort around the table.  I still found the first go-round a bit tedious.  And if we’re going to really have time to probe, we need to find a way to shorten the statement part of that, so we don’t lose our focus.  The split in the past, trying to cram into one day the economic outlook go-round and the policy discussion was not the right balance.  The policy setting is the most important part of what we do, and I really like the notion today that we had a chance to put it all together.  So I guess, Mr. Chairman, my bottom line is that I’d like to see us continue to try this two-day format and see if we can’t make some of those things even better as we have some experience. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I’m more or less in agreement with Jack’s position here.  I thought this meeting went extremely well.  The format feels more comfortable, and I think it will get more comfortable as we get more used to it—in particular, the interaction between people, which is a little different from what used to happen and I think is helpful.  So I think that, in answer to the first question, the extra time did enhance the discussion and the interaction was good. I like the separation of the economic and the policy discussions.  I liked being asked to formulate my own idea about policy as opposed to reacting to a policy recommendation.  That was helpful for me in terms of sorting out my thinking, and I like that opportunity.  So I think it’s a separation that is worth preserving. In terms of the time that the meeting takes, if we get into a period of time in which, as has not been unusual in my twelve-year tenure, months go by and you’re basically monitoring the data and everything seems to be going pretty well, and you don’t need to move policy all that much, and we sort out this whole language stuff, we may find ourselves in a situation that doesn’t require the time that the policy discussion required today.  So while I’m in favor of the flexibility that you get with the two days, we may find we don’t need it.  And I hope we get there. So I’d be willing to be a little more flexible.  And I know we’ve got to put out dates for the following year.  I think I’d rather go with something that said maybe there will be three or four two-day meetings, if we have to put out a schedule in June, and see how that works for the next year, rather than make a statement that we’re going to do the same thing for some indefinite period of time. I also think that in terms of a one-day meeting—and we’ll definitely have to have one in or the need for policy change isn’t as great—I think we could clearly start at 8:30 or even 8:00.  We’re all up and about.  Aside from having a committee meeting or something early in the morning, which I think is a good idea, to the extent we have committee meetings around the Open Market Committee, I think that by starting at 8:00 or 8:30 we can use the morning time more effectively, get more interaction, and extend the day and not bump into the 2:15 time frame.  That’s all I have to say. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  First of all, I like the format much better—the fact that we have an opportunity to express our opinions on policy before we have to react to you does open the conversation, and it does allow you to not feel that you have to get your policy in during the initial go-round.  Now, as to whether it’s one day or two days, I’m indifferent.  If it works out that we like to have the additional time the day before, I’m fine with that.  Or we will find out next time if we can have the different format within one day.  That will be fine as well.  So I’m most impressed with the different format. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I agree with everything that Cathy Minehan said.  I think she captured the reaction perfectly, that this meeting went very well.  This is a point in the cycle when our policy decisions are particularly difficult, but there have been many times when they have been no-brainers.  So maintaining some flexibility to have one-day meetings when we don’t need the two-day meetings would be ideal.   In terms of starting early, just this morning we had a meeting with Susan on the Basel issues.  We had a breakfast upstairs at 7:30, and I think we started at 7:30 and went to 8:30.  You could easily just have a breakfast right here at 7:30 for those who want it and start the meeting at 8:00.  And the Presidents are all here anyway, so I don’t think any of us would mind starting that early in the morning. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Yes, I applaud the meeting format.  I think it has gone really well.  I think you did a good job as interlocutor.  Is that how you say it?  [Laughter]  I hope in upcoming meetings that we can carve out a little time for understanding our different views about the structure of economic relationships that underlie our policy views.  And that would help take the policy discussion deeper than the level of whether you think the yield curve is too hot or too cold. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I like the format of the meeting for reasons already discussed.  I would hate to lose the special topics that we have done twice a year.  I think that’s what Jeff was referring to.  I think they have been very valuable.  I’d also point out that there’s a practical problem.  Many of the boards of directors of Reserve Banks meet the second Thursday of the month, and a Tuesday–Wednesday schedule right ahead of that is not really practical.  Richmond, in particular, has committee meetings at the end of the afternoon on Wednesday.  Sometimes we do at the St. Louis Fed as well.  So although I think a Tuesday–Wednesday is a better schedule than Monday–Tuesday, it really can’t be right up against the meetings of the boards of directors. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.   MS. PIANALTO.  I was just going to add that I agree with everyone’s statements about the format.  I like it.  I thought splitting the policy from the economic go-round was very good.  I was going to add what Bill just mentioned—special topics—because I think that there are several that we should give more time to.  So if we go to a two-day meeting format, there are going to be times when our policy decisions will require more time, but then we can use those other occasions for the special topics.  Communications is one.  Inflation expectations another.  The list is very long. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also liked the format of this meeting—we really focused on the economics, and then we had more time to talk about policy—and I hope that we stay with that format.  But I also agree regarding the special topics issue.  Talking about these topics does a lot—especially it gives us background.  What the staff led us through last summer regarding housing has been very important as we think about how to deal with housing markets now.  So I think that we need to keep those topics because they are the critical elements of policy going forward and talking about them gives us time to think about them way ahead of when we may need to make a decision. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  I would just endorse President Minehan’s summary of reactions and the comments that have been made around the table.  I think the innovations in this meeting have been excellent.  I think the meeting has run very well.  Having more time has certainly enriched the discussion of both the economy and the policy situation.  I agree, too, with President Minehan’s suggestion that there will be times when we probably do not need two days.  I have also been around through some calm times, when there was just not that much to discuss on the policy front, and I think we need some flexibility.  Special topics, I completely agree, are very, very worthwhile, and I would not want to see them go.  On the practical front, I would endorse President Poole’s concern about conflicts with board meetings.  You know, for me there would be no way of getting back for Wednesday afternoon.  We begin our board meetings on Wednesday afternoon as well.  So that’s a practical concern. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would be comfortable though we may not want to fill the time, in part because I think it’s important to give us time to do special topics as many of you have said.  I would generally be in favor of that.  And I think we should figure out how to reconcile our director meetings’ calendars with that.   I think the idea of separating the discussion about the outlook from policy is a good thing to do, but it’s a little awkward to have these conversations about the forecast without people actually revealing what their conditioning policy assumption is, and it is slightly artificial to separate them completely.  So in some sense I think, as the Greenbook does, that we should all take on the obligation in talking about our view of the forecast and the outlook to be a little more explicit about what we think at that stage is the conditioning assumption of the policy.  It doesn’t always matter a lot, but it probably does matter. In a two-day meeting, it’s probably good to make sure that we have enough time on the first day that everybody has a chance to do an initial statement.  I think chopping it up as we were forced to do today is a little suboptimal.  It’s nicer to give everyone a chance to put their basic views on the table at the beginning, and that may require, as Tom said, that we all be a little more selective in how much we say in that initial round.  It is in some ways a better basis for give-and-take once people have been able to make their initial statement. Compliments to Dave Stockton for the evolution in the Greenbook presentations of alternative scenarios.  I think that, as Dave implied, there’s probably room for further evolution in how the staff structures its contributions to the meetings.  As we think about it and as you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, how we think about evolution in our monetary policy regime and our communications regime, we should give some thought at this stage to what kind of supporting material we want to have to underpin that evolution.  I think that’s all I’ve got. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I applaud the way this meeting has been run.  It was the most enjoyable I’ve had in my long one-year tenure.  I do want to weigh in with some sympathy for those that come from the western part of the United States and have to go back for board meetings.  That would be appreciated.  Second, on special topics, I want to underscore them and also suggest that the Banks themselves have very able research staffs, and we might call on their talents to make some of those presentations.  It would, I think, be good for morale, but importantly it would round out viewpoints. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Olson.   MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to comment on two statements, one by President Hoenig and one by President Guynn—I would think we will learn a lot at the next meeting as to whether or not by starting early we could do it in a single day.  As the discussion started yesterday, it seemed to me that we were in the old pattern of the work expanding to fit the time available.  [Laughter]  It seemed to me that the statements got longer, but I did not sense that they were any more substantive than they had been in other years.  But I did like the fact that we had divided the discussion, and I like listening to the analysis before I commented on the policy.  The presumption has been that we all come in here in a mode to learn.  Otherwise we can simply e-mail our result to you.  So I liked that division. But I think we will learn a lot at the next meeting. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, like everyone else, thought this was a very successful meeting, and I liked the format very much.  The remark I was going to make is the one that Governor Olson just made, which is I think the May meeting will be a nice test as to whether we can meet President Guynn’s plea for concision, and I understand that includes present company.  [Laughter]  MR. GUYNN.  That was not what I was trying to say.  [Laughter]   MR. KOHN.  I would like to comment on one part that others haven’t commented on, and that is the formulation of the statement and the input of the statement.  I liked the idea that you and Vincent were able to work overnight to change the statement slightly to reflect the consensus around the table.  I think the statement reflects the meeting better than it would have if it were locked in concrete before we started.  And I liked the fact that it can be changed at the meeting by the consensus of the meeting.  But, also, people were appropriately, I think, restrained in their desires to make big changes in the statement, partly laying down markers for future statements, and that’s fine, too.  So there’s a nice balance between making changes and recognizing that we can’t rewrite it at the table.  But we can make it reflect the meeting a little better, particularly with the interval between the economics and the policy discussions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Just a couple of comments.  I thought the format for this meeting was excellent, and it all went quite well.  I would have a bias going forward toward two-day meetings.  Yes, there will be lots of times when the immediate policy decision is straightforward and we won’t have to spend a lot of time on it.  But I think we will have more than enough topics that we are going to want to get into in some depth for quite some time, especially if we start giving serious thought to things like inflation targeting and what we want our statements to say or not say, and so on and so forth.  So I would start with that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I would just like to insert a comment.  This wouldn’t necessarily have to be the way we did special topics, but special topics in the past were announced in January and worked on for four months.  We received a ton of paper and stuff before the meeting.  I think it would be hard to work in a special topic if the meeting weren’t going to take up the whole time.  So we might have to think a little and set out the two-day meetings.  Either that or go always to a two-day format, recognizing that some of the time we wouldn’t use it.  I think there’s some slipperiness there that needs to be thought about more clearly because you just cannot insert a special topic on the run—it takes work. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, thank you for these comments.  Our next meeting is perforce one day.  I would move that we start at 8:30.  So we will begin at 8:30 the next time.  Nevertheless, given today’s meeting, people are going to have to be conscious of time and try to be as concise and direct as possible in your comments.  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that we should probably have the experience of the one-day meeting, and perhaps even as soon as next time we can think about whether you’d like to make a change in the calendar.  Let’s be prepared to do that. Clearly, one option in terms of flexibility that President Minehan and others asked for is to have the possibility of a special topic at a two-day meeting when the business doesn’t seem likely to fill the whole meeting.  I think that rather than preparing six months in advance, we could no doubt have some topics that are prepared on a shorter time frame.  They would be less intensive.  They could be joined by the Reserve Banks as well as by the Board.  So that’s certainly one option for us to think about if we want to go to a two-day meeting more often, not necessarily every time.  But this has all been very helpful. Do we have any other business?  So, we will meet at one o’clock for lunch to honor President Santomero, and the meeting is adjourned.  Thank you very much. END OF MEETING ',\n",
              "       ' I am pleased to participate in the panel discussion at this Institute of International Finance Spring 2006 Membership Meeting. As I will make clear, I think meetings of this sort, by contributing to the dialogue between the leaders of financial institutions and policymakers, can play a critical role in increasing mutual understanding and improved decisionmaking by both groups. The financial environment can best be described as \"dynamic.\" Financial innovations have been coming at a rapid pace in recent years; new financial products have been introduced and are expanding rapidly, and new institutions have taken on prominent roles in key financial markets. Financial technologies have improved as well and have the potential to contribute to the efficiency and resilience of financial markets. However, with new products and institutions comes the potential for new risks to financial stability. As a result, we policymakers are likely to be torn. On the one hand, we may want to encourage welfare-improving innovations by limiting the extent of regulation. On the other hand, because of possible systemic concerns, some policymakers may want to regulate innovative instruments and institutions even as they are developing. In my view, policymakers can best balance these goals by expending the effort needed to understand financial innovations as they emerge and by avoiding overregulation that may stifle valuable innovations.When I talk about financial innovations, I have in mind several types of developments. A far-reaching set of innovations is the development and increasing popularity of products for the transfer of credit risk. Prominent among such innovations are credit derivatives, asset-backed securities, and secondary-market trading of syndicated loans. Another important development has been the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry and its expanded role in the financial system. On the retail side, we have seen a proliferation of new lending products in the United States, including home-equity lines of credit, interest-only and even negative-amortization mortgages, and subprime mortgages and consumer loans.Today, I will discuss briefly the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with new products and institutions and spend most of my remarks on a middle way that regulators might pursue as these new products and institutions emerge.Benefits and DrawbacksFinancial innovations hold the promise of improved efficiency and increased overall economic welfare. For example, new products and markets can open the door to new investment opportunities for a variety of market participants. And improved risk-measurement and risk-management technologies can contribute to an improved allocation of risk as risk is shifted to those more willing and able to bear it.Financial innovations also have the potential to boost financial stability. Risk-transfer mechanisms can not only better allocate risk but also reduce its concentration. Improved efficiencies and increased competition may result in substantially lower trading costs and may consequently improve liquidity in many markets. Better liquidity, which is instrumental to faster and more accurate price discovery and therefore to more-informative prices, can also be brought about by an increased presence of new institutions in new or existing markets. The entry of those new institutions into new markets can, so long as the institutions prove resilient, increase the availability of funds to borrowers in times of stress and may thus reduce the likelihood of credit crunches.Although financial innovations have the capacity to improve economic welfare overall, it is natural for policymakers to worry that innovations may have unexpected and undesirable side effects and may even represent new sources of systemic risk. For example, policymakers may be concerned about unexpected price dynamics or problems in infrastructure or operations. Market participants estimate how prices and investment flows are likely to behave for new instruments, but their understanding becomes more detailed and more accurate only as behavior under a variety of economic conditions is observed, and the development of that understanding obviously takes time. Under turbulent conditions, or when new information causes market participants to question their own investment strategies, their behavior may change rapidly, leading to rapid price changes that may seem outsized relative to changes in economic fundamentals. That was briefly the case recently in the market for synthetic collateralized debt obligations. Market participants did not anticipate the sharp decline in implied default correlations that followed the downgrades of Ford and General Motors debt. Prices moved quite a bit for a short time as portfolios were rebalanced, but spillovers to other markets were limited, and market volatility subsequently eased.Problems with the infrastructure or operations that support an innovation--including the underlying legal documentation and accounting--are also likely to be revealed only over time, as exemplified by the technical difficulties with restructuring clauses in credit default swaps that became apparent a few years ago. In that case, default events and related payoffs sometimes did not occur as expected, and so actual exposures differed from those investors had intended. The result was a change in the value of existing contracts and a period of market adjustment as new restructuring clauses were developed and implemented.Of course, we should not want to prevent rapid price changes or changes in investment flows, as such changes may be appropriate as new information about fundamentals emerges. And the occurrence of glitches in new markets and institutions need not reflect policy failures or provide evidence that an innovation is undesirable. Preventing all such occurrences would probably require us to stop all innovation. But neither is it desirable that growing pains in one market or at a few institutions spill over so strongly that the financial system as a whole could be destabilized.A Middle Way in RegulationPolicymakers have a range of strategies available for dealing with innovation. At one extreme, in theory we could take a completely hands-off approach, allowing new financial markets and instruments to develop without restrictions and indeed without any scrutiny, trusting private market participants to do everything necessary for stability and efficiency. At the other extreme, policymakers theoretically might be quite heavy-handed, either imposing regulations on virtually every market and instrument to stop any innovations that, in their judgment, could cause harm or, conversely, actively fostering or subsidizing innovations seen as desirable.Obviously, these are extreme positions, and I do not know of any practicing policymaker who seriously wants to pursue either extreme course. Today I wish to argue for a middle ground in which markets are allowed to work and develop and in which policymakers work hard to understand new developments and to help market participants see the need for improvements where appropriate. In my view, regulations should be imposed only when market participants do not have the incentive or the capability to effectively manage the risks created by financial innovation. For example, explicit or implicit subsidies of some institutions could limit market discipline of their risk-taking, leading to a concentration of risk so large that even the most sophisticated institutions would find it next to impossible to manage the risk under stressful circumstances. Or policymakers may be concerned that some potential parties to innovative contracts, especially in the retail arena, are insufficiently knowledgeable to understand or manage the associated risks. I believe such instances are rare. Making a case for early regulatory intervention is particularly difficult when the private parties involved in an innovation are sophisticated because, in many cases, they will be the first to recognize possible problems and will have strong incentives to fix them and also to protect themselves against fraud or unfair dealing.So how should policymakers proceed down this middle path? First of all, we need to learn--we need to understand and evaluate the innovations that are taking place in financial markets. This process should include information sharing with other authorities, including those in other nations, in order to benefit from the experiences in other markets and regions. The resulting improved understanding is often enough to prepare policymakers to deal with any breakdowns that do occur and to avoid having the breakdowns turn into systemic problems. The U.S. response to the century date change is an example from a different context that fits into this category. In that case, policymakers worked hard to understand the complex practical issues and to share that knowledge with financial firms. Those firms independently evaluated the risks they faced and took appropriate action to manage them effectively.Improved understanding may also ease concerns about potential risks. For example, in light of the effects of financial consolidation on the number of firms acting as dealers in the market for dollar interest rate options, the Federal Reserve became concerned about possible risks to the functioning of that market. These concerns included questions about the adequacy of risk management at the remaining dealers and about the possible effects that problems at one of those dealers could have on its counterparties and market liquidity. However, further investigation by Federal Reserve staff suggested that market participants were generally managing their market and counterparty risks effectively and that those hedging risk in the options market would not unduly suffer from a temporary disruption in liquidity. Our wariness about concentration in this market has not disappeared as a result of our improved understanding, but it has diminished. In general, improved knowledge about financial innovations may prevent the imposition of unwarranted restrictions and is surely a precursor to intelligent regulation in the event it is warranted.A second step for policymakers walking the middle path should be to ensure that market participants have the proper incentives and the information they need to protect themselves from any problems related to new products, markets, or institutions; by so doing, policymakers can perhaps mitigate those problems. Policymakers should insist that regulated firms effectively manage the risks associated with new activities and markets, thereby fostering effective market discipline of risk-taking, including risk-taking by unregulated firms. Such an insistence generally does not require new regulation but rather is an application of existing regulation in a potentially new context. One of the lessons of the difficulties at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was that the hedge fund had been able to achieve very high levels of leverage because some regulated counterparties had not appropriately managed their counterparty risk exposures. Subsequently, both banks and supervisors had to reassess what such management entailed. Clearly, supervisors should strongly encourage institutions to know their risk posture and to be able to control it and react appropriately as circumstances change. Policymakers should insist on similarly high risk-management standards for regulated financial institutions that provide retail products. As a case in point, bank supervisors in the United States recently issued guidance about the management of risks related to home-equity lines of credit. This guidance did not involve new regulation of these instruments but rather reminded institutions offering such products that they have an obligation to manage the resulting risks appropriately.A pervasive lack of awareness about the risks embedded in new financial products certainly increases the likelihood that users of those products may face difficulties and that those difficulties may become systemic. One way policymakers can help prevent this possibility from happening is by supporting increased transparency and disclosure. Although counterparties in wholesale markets should generally be expected to demand and obtain the information they need to evaluate their risks, policymakers can no doubt help establish high standards. In the case of retail transactions, support for efforts to foster the basic financial literacy of households is a useful complement to efforts to promote appropriate disclosure. The more consumers are equipped to interpret disclosures, the more effective those disclosures are likely to be.A third feature of the moderate approach I am trying to chart is an active dialogue between policymakers and market participants. In my view, policymakers should serve as a voice for the development of infrastructure and sensible standards and practices. Ideally such steps would be taken by market participants of their own volition, but sometimes informal interventions by policymakers can help foster cooperative efforts by market participants. For example, partly in reaction to the report of the second Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently hosted a meeting with representatives of major participants in the credit default swap market, as well as with their domestic and international supervisors, to discuss a range of issues, including market practices with regard to assignments of trades and operational issues associated with confirmation backlogs. The result was an industry commitment to take concrete steps to address issues of concern.A fourth dimension of my proposed middle path is the ongoing monitoring of key markets and institutions. Policymakers should be aware of any emerging stresses in the financial system, including those related to new instruments and institutions. Indeed, some central banks have created \"financial stability\" staff groups to oversee such monitoring and, in some cases, to publish regular financial stability reports. In the event that such monitoring suggests that the operations of some institutions or markets are under significant strain and, importantly, that the resulting pressures on businesses and households could have a material adverse effect on the real economy, the central bank may want to respond by adjusting the stance of monetary policy.Finally, financial innovations may on occasion warrant new regulations because financial institutions either cannot or will not manage the associated risks appropriately. Indeed, regulation should be seen as part of the broader \"infrastructure\" that supports both financial stability and innovation, and like other more traditional infrastructure, regulatory regimes have to keep up. For example, developments in financial markets and advances in the ability of banks to measure and manage their risks have increasingly made the existing capital regulation of the largest banks, the 1988 Basel Accord, look antiquated. Basel II is a more flexible framework than Basel I and is intended to better permit capital regulation to keep up with financial market innovations in the future.To conclude, I wish to emphasize that policymakers should have a bias toward trusting financial markets to manage the introduction of new products and the development of new institutions smoothly and without undue stress to the financial system. However, we cannot take such an outcome for granted: Financial firms may not consider the effects of their decisions on the stability of other firms or on the broader financial markets, and some may lack the incentives and ability to learn about and manage the risks induced by financial innovations. In such cases, policymakers may need to work with markets and their participants, and on occasion regulate them, to achieve the desired outcomes. However, policymakers should, wherever possible, avoid premature regulation that could stifle innovation. I would note that a significant number of substantial shocks to financial markets have occurred in recent years--including, for example, the difficulties at Long-Term Capital Management and the unexpected and massive fraud at some high-profile companies--and yet the broader effects on the real economy have ultimately been quite small. Our financial markets are flexible and resilient, and they can absorb shocks surprisingly well. As a result, most risks caused by new developments in financial markets should be manageable without heavy-handed regulation. This meeting is a good example of what my middle course suggests we should be doing: working hard to understand innovations and their possible implications. Alertness and knowledge on the part of policymakers would go a long way toward ensuring that our positive recent track record will carry on amid what I am sure will continue to be a rapidly changing financial landscape. Thank you for the invitation to speak here at the Banking Institute. I want to discuss with you today some recent and ongoing regulatory issues that are likely of interest to this audience. These issues include efforts to enhance our regulatory capital regime, compliance risk management, and consumer protection.Proposed Revisions to Regulatory Capital RegimeFirst of all, you probably heard the good news yesterday that the Federal Reserve Board reviewed and in an open Board meeting approved a draft of the interagency notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on the Basel II capital framework. The draft NPR was made available on the Board\\'s website as well as some statements made at the public meeting. The final NPR is expected to be issued in the Federal Register once all of the U.S. banking agencies have completed their review and approval processes, at which time it will then be \"officially\" out for comment. We are very pleased that the substantial time spent on this effort has culminated in this agreement among the agencies. We also recognize the significance of this development to the industry, the Congress, and others who have waited for greater specificity on the proposed revisions. We look forward to comments on the NPR; they will be an important contribution to the assessment of Basel II objectives and implementation of the framework. In some areas, the agencies are still grappling with what the correct approach is. For this reason, the NPR contains a number of requests for feedback on specific topics. All of this will help us as we continue to develop the framework. But before commenting further on the NPR and the U.S. Basel II process, I would like to reiterate our rationale for pursuing Basel II.Reasons for Pursuing Basel IIThe current Basel I capital framework, adopted nearly twenty years ago, has served us well, but has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks that are offering ever-more complex and sophisticated products and services. We need a revised capital framework for these large, internationally active banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework.One of the major improvements in Basel II is the closer linking of capital requirements and risk. The current Basel I measures are not very risk-sensitive and do not provide bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace with meaningful measures of risk at large, complex organizations. Under Basel I, it is possible for two banks with dramatically different risk profiles in their commercial loan portfolio to have the same regulatory capital requirement, and a bank\\'s capital requirement does not reflect deterioration in asset quality. In addition, the balance-sheet focus of Basel I does not adequately capture risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions and fee-based activity--for example, the operational risk embedded in many of the services from which many large U.S. institutions generate a good portion of their revenues.In addition to enhancing the meaningfulness of regulatory capital measures, Basel II should make the financial system safer by substantially improving risk management at banks. Basel II builds on the risk-management approaches of well-managed banks and creates incentives for banks to move toward leading risk-measurement and risk-management practices. By providing a consistent framework for all banks to use, supervisors will more readily be able to identify portfolios and banks whose risk management and risk levels are significantly different from the range seen in other banks. By communicating these differences to banks, management will be able to benchmark their risk assessments, models, and processes in a more detailed and regular manner. We have already seen some progress in risk management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of preparations for Basel II. The new framework is also much more consistent with the internal capital measures that institutions use to manage their business.Basel II can also provide supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for assessing the link between risk and capital over time at our most complex institutions; identifying which institutions have deficiencies; and evaluating systemic risk in the banking system through credit cycles. Therefore, Basel II establishes a more coherent relationship between how supervisors assess regulatory capital and how they supervise the banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent capital levels, given their risk profiles, and to better understand differences among institutions.As a central bank and supervisor of banks, bank holdings companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital. That is why we support safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to Basel II, and will remain vigilant in monitoring Basel II\\'s impact on an ongoing basis. This means that during and after the transition to Basel II, supervisors will rely upon ongoing, detailed analysis to continuously evaluate the results of the new framework and ensure prudent levels of capital. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is critical to the health of our banking system and we believe that Basel II will help us continue to ensure that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that serve as an appropriate cushion against risk-taking.As we have mentioned before, we will continue to use existing prudential measures to complement Basel II. For example, the current leverage ratio requirement--a ratio of capital to total assets--will remain unchanged for all banks, whether or not they are subject to the Basel II framework. Also, supervisors will continue to enforce existing prompt-corrective-action rules in response to declines in capital. Both the leverage ratio and prompt-corrective-action are fully consistent with Basel II.Basel II NPRI will not try to summarize the NPR here today. We want all of you to read it and come to your own judgments. I would, however, like to highlight a few key points.As you know, the U.S. Basel II NPR is based on the 2004 framework issued by the Basel Committee and adheres to the main elements of that framework. But the U.S. agencies, just as their counterparts in other countries, have exercised national discretion and tailored the Basel II framework to fit the U.S. banking system and U.S. financial environment. For example, the U.S. agencies continue to propose that we implement only the advanced approaches of Basel II, namely the advanced internal-ratings-based approach (AIRB) for credit risk and the advanced measurement approaches (AMA) for operational risk.The U.S. agencies also included in the NPR a timetable and set of transition safeguards that are more rigorous than those set forth in the 2004 Basel II framework. For instance, the U.S. agencies are proposing three transition floors, below which minimum required capital under Basel II will not be permitted to fall, relative to the general risk-based capital rules. The first transition period would have a floor of 95 percent, the second 90 percent, and the third 85 percent. Part of the justification for implementing more rigorous floors stemmed from the lessons we learned from the fourth quantitative impact study (QIS4) conducted in the United States in 2004. As I have said before, QIS4 was not intended to reflect the ultimate impact of Basel II on U.S. institutions--particularly since it was not based on a complete proposal and bank inputs to QIS4 were not based on fully developed systems or full supervisory guidance. Rather, it was conducted on a \"best-efforts basis\" to provide a snapshot for gauging progress toward implementation of Basel II and to give the U.S. agencies a better sense of how to structure the NPR.One of the key areas in the NPR influenced by QIS4 pertains to banks\\' estimates of loss given default (LGD). QIS4 results showed that, in general, data histories were not long enough to capture weaker parts of the economic cycle, especially for LGDs, which must reflect downturn conditions. As a result, the agencies have provided a supervisory mapping function for those institutions unable to estimate downturn LGDs. The mapping function takes average LGDs and \"stresses\" them to generate an input to the capital calculation that is better suited to the Basel II formulas and produces a more appropriate capital requirement. The Federal Reserve believes this supervisory mapping function is a necessary component of Basel II because it appears difficult for some banks to produce internal estimates of LGD that are sufficient for risk-based capital purposes.I hope it is clear from the NPR and other statements made by the agencies that we are committed to ongoing, detailed analysis to ensure that U.S. implementation of Basel II achieves a strong and risk-sensitive base of minimum regulatory capital. We need to ensure that the items we identified as incomplete in QIS4 are appropriately addressed, and we also need to ensure that additional areas will not inadvertently lower capital levels. We intend to conduct thorough analysis of each institution\\'s Basel II capital results and the impact on aggregate capital in the U.S. banking system at many stages along the way.In addition, the U.S. regulators are united in their belief that no bank should be permitted to operate under Basel II until it has proven itself ready to do so. There will be no \"free pass\" or \"safe harbor\" for any institution, regardless of portfolio composition or business activity. In other words, we plan to have very high standards for Basel II qualification requirements. For instance, a bank will be able to move from the parallel run to live capital calculations with a 95 percent floor only after its primary supervisor has given it permission to do so after having thoroughly evaluated its risk-management methodologies and its ability to calculate minimum regulatory capital using the new framework. Similarly, a bank will need approval to move to each of the other two floor levels. After the third floor period, a bank will be allowed to move to the full Basel II minimum capital calculation without floors upon a finding by the primary supervisor that it is ready, following a rigorous qualification process.Proposed Amendments to Basel IBefore I end my remarks about regulatory capital, I would like to offer some thoughts about ongoing efforts to revise existing regulatory capital rules, known as Basel I. First of all, we expect only one or two dozen banks to move to Basel II in the near term. The vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely and profitably under Basel I as amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework has already been amended more than twenty-five times in response to changes in the banking environment and a better understanding of the risks of individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules.Concerns have been raised about potential competitive inequities between Basel II banks and Basel I banks. We take these concerns seriously and sought input from the industry and other interested parties in the Basel I ANPR process. In an effort to mitigate those concerns, regulators have proposed changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules and remain vigilant about potential competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II. We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules will apply.Additionally, we recognize the need for full transparency about Basel II proposals and proposed Basel I amendments. For that reason, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the proposed Basel I amendments. The intent is to allow banks and others to review both NPRs before both sets of rules are finalized. In that way, bankers from potential opt-in institutions and those not planning to move to Basel II can evaluate the potential impact of Basel II in light of the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping timeframes. At this point, we are still reviewing the comments received on the ANPR for amendments to Basel I. The comment period ended in mid-January. The agencies are developing their proposals for Basel I amendments, based on comments received, and hope to have a Basel I NPR by summer.Finally, I would like to underscore that both regulatory capital proposals being worked on by the U.S. agencies are just that--proposals. The U.S. agencies welcome any and all comments on these documents. Accordingly, our proposals could change based on comments received or new information gathered by the U.S. agencies. We know that at times this posture can be frustrating to some, but given the breadth and depth of these proposals, it is critical that we consider all viewpoints. This is especially true for the Basel II proposal, which represents a substantial and complex change in bank supervision and regulation. In this respect, I would like to echo the comments made earlier this month by Comptroller John Dugan: if the U.S. agencies see that Basel II is not accurately reflecting risk or is producing unacceptable capital levels, we will seek to make changes. Indeed, we expect to make some adjustments as we move forward, just as changes have been made to Basel I over the years to reflect changes in bank practice and improvements in supervision.Compliance-Risk ManagementWhile the release of the Basel II NPR is indeed a major step forward, it is of course not the only topic worth addressing here today. Accordingly, I would now like to turn to another area the financial sector and regulators are focused on: compliance-risk management. \"Compliance-risk\" can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to an organization\\'s reputation and franchise value. This type of risk may result when an organization fails to comply with the laws, regulations, or standards or codes of conduct that are applicable to its business activities and functions. The Federal Reserve expects each banking organization to have a compliance culture in place across the whole institution and an infrastructure that can identify and control the compliance risks it faces, along with appropriate rewards and penalties for business managers who oversee the compliance risk.To create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organizations must first understand risks across the entire entity. Managers should be expected to evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually. I also emphasize the need for the board of directors and senior management to ensure that staff members throughout their organizations understand the compliance objectives and each member\\'s role in implementing the compliance program.An enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program should be dynamic and proactive, meaning it constantly assesses evolving risks when new business lines or activities are added or when existing activities are altered. To avoid having a program that operates on \"autopilot,\" an organization must continuously reassess its risks and controls and train employees to effectively implement those controls.An integrated approach to compliance-risk management can be particularly effective for Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering (BSA/AML) compliance. Often, the identification of a BSA/AML risk or deficiency in one business activity can indicate potential problems or concerns in other activities across the organization. Controlling BSA/AML risk continues to be a primary concern for banking organizations.The FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual reflects a common view of the federal banking agencies and the Treasury Department\\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with regard to BSA/AML compliance expectations. The agencies universally stress that the purpose of a BSA/AML examination is to assess the overall adequacy of a banking organization\\'s BSA/AML controls, in view of that particular organization\\'s lines of business and customer mix. This is critical to ensuring that resulting controls are risk-based, so that resources are directed appropriately.Consumer ProtectionThe Federal Reserve also cares greatly about consumer protection, as should bankers when they are assembling a broad risk-management strategy. Bankers need to be especially alert to developing easily understood disclosures as they introduce more innovative and complex products that can be confusing to consumers. As you may know, the U.S. banking agencies recently issued proposed guidance on nontraditional mortgages. The comment period for this interagency proposal closed on March 29, so we are now in the process of reviewing comments and determining how to proceed.Nontraditional mortgages allow borrowers to defer payment of principal and, sometimes, interest. While the proposed guidance focuses on banks\\' ability to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products, it also addresses consumer protection. Nontraditional mortgages, including \"interest-only\" mortgages and \"payment-option\" adjustable-rate mortgages, have been available for many years, and are beneficial for some borrowers because of the payment flexibility they offer. Although these products were initially designed for higher-income borrowers, today these products are being offered to a wider spectrum of consumers, including borrowers for whom these types of mortgages may be ill-suited. Moreover, institutions are combining these nontraditional loans with other practices, such as reduced documentation of income and assets in evaluating applicants\\' creditworthiness. Many borrowers may not fully recognize the risks of nontraditional mortgages, particularly \"payment shock\" when the loan\\'s interest rate increases, or when the consumer is required to make fully amortizing payments. Negative amortization coupled with flattening, or even lower, housing prices could make it difficult for some borrowers to refinance or sell the property to avoid payment shock.In addition to ensuring that institutions comply with the Truth in Lending Act and other applicable laws, the draft guidance urges institutions to ensure that their advertisements, promotional materials, and oral communications are consistent with the product terms and that these communications provide clear, balanced, and timely information about the risks. This is important so that consumers have the information they need at critical decision times, such as when selecting a loan product or choosing a specific payment option each month.The Board\\'s Truth in Lending regulations require creditors to provide consumers with disclosures about the loan terms, including a schedule of payments. For interest-only and payment option ARMs, the payment schedule shows consumers how their payments will increase to include amortization of the principal. The proposed interagency guidance describes how institutions can use their promotional materials to provide better information about the features and risks of these products, especially the risk of payment shock. For example, the guidance recommends that institutions\\' promotional materials inform consumers about the maximum monthly payment they could be required to pay once interest-rate caps and negative-amortization caps have been reached. The proposed guidance also lists recommended practices to address other risks. When negative amortization is possible, the guidance suggests that institutions alert consumers about the consequences of increasing principal balances and decreasing home equity. If both reduced-documentation and full-documentation loan programs are offered, the draft guidance advises institutions to inform consumers if they will pay a pricing premium for the reduced-documentation loan. When institutions provide monthly statements with payment options, they are urged to include on the statement information that enables borrowers to make responsible choices, by explaining each payment option and the impact of each choice.In addition to the draft nontraditional mortgages, the Federal Reserve Board plans to hold several public hearings this summer on home-equity lending. These hearings are a first step to a broader review of mortgage disclosure rules. One of the issues that will be explored at the hearings is likely to be the adequacy of the existing disclosures for nontraditional mortgages, such as interest-only loans and payment-option ARMs, as well as forty-year mortgages and reverse mortgages.The hearings also likely will address issues related to predatory lending and market developments since 2002, when the Board last revised its rules for higher-priced loans under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Concerns about predatory lending continue to be raised, and the hearings could explore the impact of the HOEPA rule changes on abusive lending practices as well as on the availability of subprime credit.ConclusionIn carrying out its role as central bank and banking supervisor, the Federal Reserve must continue to ensure that banking institutions operate in a safe and sound manner with a strong capital base. For large, internationally active U.S. organizations, the Federal Reserve believes that the current regulatory capital regime is insufficient. The Basel II framework, we believe, provides more risk sensitivity and a much better link between capital and risk--especially for complex products, services and processes--promotes advanced risk management practices and improves transparency to supervisors, bankers, and markets about the nature of risk exposures and risk management.Beyond our work on regulatory capital, we encourage institutions to focus on overall improvements in risk management, of which compliance-risk management is an important element. One key message is to continue to make sure the compliance process reflects the changing product and customer mix of the financial institution. Another is that as institutions provide more complex products with features that are not as familiar to the customer, the organization must also improve the clarity of its communications with customers.Footnotes As many of you know, I became a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only a month ago. I am delighted to be giving my first speech as a governor at a conference that has resulted from the kind of international cooperation that I see as essential in today\\'s world. The joint sponsorship of this conference by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago represents an extremely fruitful collaboration of researchers, market participants, and policymakers from both sides of the Atlantic. Having been a research consultant at the Chicago Fed for many years and having visited the ECB numerous times since its founding less than eight years ago, I have many friends at both institutions and am pleased to see so many of those friends here today.In addition, I am delighted that the topic of this cooperative venture and my maiden speech is central counterparty (CCP) clearing. As an academic, I wrote several papers on clearing arrangements and participated in many conferences such as this one. I am very pleased to be in a room filled with others who share that interest.But perhaps it is not unreasonable to ask whether that track record will be maintained. I see that good track record as a result of innovations that over time produced organizational arrangements that have provided market participants with the incentives and capabilities to ensure effective CCP risk management, thereby serving the public interest as well as the interests of market participants. Significant changes to those arrangements could result in less-effective risk management. Furthermore, some CCPs have begun to clear new products, some of which may be less liquid or more complex than exchange-traded derivatives, and thus may pose challenges to traditional risk-management procedures. Finally, more-intense government regulation of CCPs may prove counterproductive if it creates moral hazard or impedes the ability of CCPs to develop new approaches to risk management. As cross-border activity becomes ever more important, regulatory differences across countries may become an increasingly serious impediment to innovation by CCPs.In my remarks today, I will begin by reviewing the historical development of CCPs. I do this not for antiquarian interest but because this history illustrates how market forces led to the evolution of organizational and contractual features that have created strong incentives for effective private regulation that addressed both market participants\\' and public policymakers\\' concerns about risk control. I will then discuss the possible implications of recent variations on traditional arrangements. Next I will discuss the challenges involved in clearing certain new products, particularly over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. I will conclude with some views on how government regulation can provide an environment in which private regulation of CCP risk management continues to be effective.An important lesson from the CBOT\\'s experience is that a CCP emerged gradually and slowly as a result of experience and experimentation. Early on, the CBOT recognized the importance of creating incentives for adherence to its rules, including the contractual obligations of counterparties to contracts traded on the exchange. Initially, the primary incentive was the threat that a member that defaulted on its obligations could be barred from the trading floor. No doubt this consequence was a powerful incentive for solvent members to meet their obligations, but an insolvent member might not have assigned significant value to the loss of trading privileges. By 1873, the CBOT recognized the importance of evaluating the solvency of its members and adopted a resolution stipulating that any member whose solvency was questioned must open its financial accounts to inspection and could be expelled if it refused to do so. Around the same time, the exchange introduced initial and variation margin requirements for contracts traded on the exchange and set strict time limits for the posting of margin deposits. Failure to post margin deposits would be considered a default on the member\\'s contracts.The next step along the road to addressing private and public concerns about effective risk control was the CBOT\\'s creation of a clearinghouse in 1883. For many years, the clearinghouse was not a true CCP. Rather, as created, it was merely a mechanism to reduce transactions costs by calculating members\\' net obligations to post margin and to settle contracts. In the event of a member\\'s default, the clearinghouse assumed no responsibility for settling the defaulting member\\'s trades or for covering the losses to other members that exceeded the amount of margin that the defaulting member had posted.What is interesting and instructive about the history of these arrangements is that it illustrates how market forces can produce private regulations that address the concerns about safety, soundness, and broader financial stability.Potential Challenges Raised by Recent Changes to CCP OrganizationDuring the twentieth century, various changes occurred in the historical organizational arrangements that I have characterized as a partial integration of the members of the exchange. And in the twenty-first century, the pace of change seems to be accelerating. Some derivatives exchanges have remained integrated with their CCP, but even in those cases, there now tends to be less integration. Members of the exchange are seldom required to be members of the clearinghouse. Instead, members of the exchange may arrange to clear through other members, which are referred to as \"clearing members.\" When a clearing member agrees to clear for a nonclearing member, it becomes responsible to the clearinghouse for the obligations of the nonclearing member. Only the clearing members are required to buy stock in the clearinghouse or to contribute to a clearing fund that would be used to cover losses from defaults by other clearing members, including defaults on their obligations to perform on positions held by nonclearing members.In recent years, an increasing number of exchanges have engaged unaffiliated CCPs to clear their trades. A \"horizontal\" integration of CCPs has replaced the \"vertical\" integration of an exchange and its CCP. Both horizontally integrated CCPs and vertically integrated CCPs have often arranged for insurance policies that limit the potential losses to their clearing members from defaults. Finally, many exchanges have converted from mutual associations of exchange members to for-profit corporations.Clearly some of these changes have important implications for competition among exchanges. But they may also have implications for the effectiveness of risk management, which is the focus of my remarks today. As I have discussed, historically the key to effective risk management has been that the members of the exchange have borne the risk of losses from defaults and have had the capacity to institute risk controls (principally membership standards and margin requirements) that have limited those risks. The question then is whether any of these changes to the organization of CCPs has left those bearing the risks without the capacity to manage those risks.I would caution against assuming that change is inherently risky. After all, as we have seen, the partial integration model that worked so well for so many years emerged only gradually as a result of experimentation. Moreover, thinking that \"one size fits all\" regarding the organization of financial markets is a mistake. That said, it seems critical that the organization of any CCP, including a CCP that follows the traditional partial-integration model, should conform to a pair of broad principles. First, a CCP\\'s default rules need to be transparent: The party that bears the risk of default (who has \"skin in the game\") must be clear to all. Second, a CCP\\'s governance arrangements must provide those with \"skin in the game\" with substantial influence over the CCP\\'s risk controls.New ProductsIn recent years, appreciation of the possible benefits of a well-organized CCP has been growing. CCP arrangements have been introduced in a wide variety of markets that had not previously been served by CCPs. In the United States, the New York Stock Exchange established a clearinghouse in 1892 and transformed it into a true CCP in 1920. But, outside the United States, few securities exchanges established CCPs until late in the twentieth century. Today, a CCP is in place and functioning in nearly all major securities markets. Increasingly often, CCPs for securities clear trades, including trades and repurchase agreements involving government bonds, in the over-the-counter securities markets. Since 1999 the London Clearing House (now LCH.Clearnet) has been clearing growing volumes of some types of OTC derivatives through its SwapClear service.The Role of GovernmentIn recent years, policymakers have devoted much attention to oversight and regulation of CCPs, with the objective of promoting their soundness and stability. I certainly share that objective, but I would like to call attention to some possible unintended and undesirable consequences of CCP regulation. The first is moral hazard. Policymakers must be very careful to avoid any impression that government oversight comes with a promise of government financial support in the event of a risk-management failure; otherwise, private-market discipline, which has served private and public interests in the stability of CCP arrangements so well for so long, may well be eviscerated.Instead, government regulation should focus on improving the effectiveness of private-market regulation. In particular, it should enforce the observance of the two critical principles I identified earlier. First, it should ensure that a CCP\\'s risk-management policies and procedures, especially its policies for handling defaults and allocating the burden of losses from defaults, are transparent to market participants. Second, it should ensure that CCP governance arrangements provide the parties who would bear the losses with substantial influence over the CCP\\'s risk-management policies.My sense is that policymakers are well aware of the risks that moral hazard poses for financial stability. But I am concerned that a second unintended consequence of regulation has too often gone unrecognized. That is the potential for conflicting regulation (and laws) to impede the evolution of CCP arrangements, especially the potential for economies of scale and scope to be achieved through consolidation. I am always puzzled when I hear the United States held up as the model for the benefits of consolidation of the clearing and settlement infrastructure. We have achieved significant consolidation within the securities markets and within the futures markets. But I am struck by the lack of consolidation of securities and futures CCPs. Perhaps there is no business case for such consolidation. Even if a business case exists, however, I believe consolidation would be difficult to achieve due to the legal and regulatory distinctions in the United States between securities and futures.ConclusionsI find the history of financial markets to be enormously instructive. My reading of the history of CCP clearing is that it teaches us that private-market regulation can be effective for achieving the public policy goal of safety and soundness and broader financial stability. Government regulation and oversight should seek to provide an environment in which private regulation can be most effective. Government regulation should not place unnecessary barriers--domestically or internationally--in the path of the future evolution of private-market regulation. Innovation should be fostered, and regulatory protectionism should be rejected.Footnotes Good morning. We are here today to learn about a report on a topic of vital importance to our economic future: the financial literacy of America’s young people. Increasingly, personal financial security requires the ability to understand and navigate the financial marketplace. For example, buying a home, saving for retirement or for children’s education, or even effectively managing the family budget now requires more financial sophistication than ever before. Financially literate consumers make the financial marketplace work better, and they are better-informed citizens as well. As a former educator and school board member, and as the parent of two young adults, I am personally convinced that improving education is vital to the future of our economy and that promoting financial literacy in particular must be a high priority. I know that those of you here today join me in this conviction.The Jump$tart Coalition is a leader among organizations seeking to improve the personal financial literacy of students from kindergarten to the university level. In particular, through its biennial survey of high school seniors--the results of which you will hear about in a few minutes--Jump$tart has brought increased attention to the issue of financial literacy among youth in the United States. Over the ten-year history of this survey, the data gathered have become some of the most useful measures of what young adults understand about finances.The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to Jump$tart’s mission to better educate America’s youth about personal finance. On the regional level, many Federal Reserve Bank staff members work closely with the state coalitions to help achieve this mission. In fact, there is at least one specialist in economic education at each of the Reserve Banks and at most of the Branches. Many of these specialists offer training seminars to help educators teach economics and personal finance in their classrooms. The Federal Reserve also supports a variety of programs and initiatives to increase financial literacy. I want to take a moment to describe just two of these initiatives.The first is a student competition called The Fed Challenge, a program designed to teach students about monetary policy and the national economy. Among other activities, students in this competition take the roles of Federal Reserve governors and regional Reserve Bank presidents in a mock meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Participating Reserve Banks work in partnership with the Board to bring the winning teams to Washington, where the final rounds of competition will be held here in the Board Room. I have had the opportunity on several occasions to serve as a judge in the national finals of The Fed Challenge, and I can attest that the economic knowledge displayed by the students in that competition is remarkable indeed.I want to take this opportunity to thank the Jump$tart Coalition and their partners for their continued support and commitment to furthering the financial education of our youth. Now, it is with great pleasure that I introduce to you Laura Levine, executive director of the coalition, who will give a report on the status of financial education of youth in this country. I am delighted that my first speeches as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are in international settings. Earlier this week I spoke at the European Central Bank, and I am honored today to be able to address this group at the London School of Economics (LSE). The global collection of top academics, key policymakers, and leading private-market participants in these audiences represents what I believe is vital in today\\'s world: a strong spirit of international cooperation and understanding.I am also pleased about the forward-looking nature of the conference on \"The Future of Financial Regulation\" and would like to express special thanks to two of our hosts at the LSE who have had much first-hand experience at policymaking, Sir Howard Davies, formerly of the U.K.\\'s Financial Services Authority, and Professor Charles Goodhart, formerly a member of the Bank of England\\'s Monetary Policy Committee. LSE certainly seems to have all of the bases covered!What I want to do in my remarks today is to focus on the economic consequences of removing cross-border barriers in banking to show that Commissioner McCreevy is correct: After the removal of barriers to the geographic expansion of banks, the United States experienced substantial gains in terms of banking efficiency, employment growth, and economic growth.Historically, banking in the United States has been subject to extensive government regulation covering the prices banks can charge, the activities they can engage in, the risks they can take, the capital they must hold, and the locations in which they can operate. But during the past thirty years, many restrictions on bank prices and activities in the United States have been lifted, including the restrictions on entry and geographic expansion.As barriers to banking expansion across borders have come down, the structure of the industry has changed dramatically. Geographic deregulation has spawned a substantial reduction in the number of banking organizations in the United States with, on average, virtually no change in concentration at the local level. In addition, the average number of distinct banking organizations operating in local markets--both urban and rural--is little changed. The total number of banking offices in the United States has risen steadily since the mid-1990s. Moreover, consolidation has produced important benefits for the banking industry, as many banks have become more diversified, less risky, and more efficient.A growing body of research provides evidence that geographic deregulation has provided substantial benefits to the broader economy as well (Levine, 2004). In the United States, economic performance improved after geographic deregulation, as evidenced by increases in the rate of state-level employment growth and the rate of new business formation. Geographic deregulation may also be associated with improvements in state-level economic stability. Volatility in the growth rates of employment declined, and the link between the health of local banks and growth in the local economy weakened.In my judgment, the U.S. experience with geographic deregulation provides some valuable lessons for the European Union, so let me turn to that experience now.Origins and Deregulation of Geographic Restrictions in the United States\\nRestrictions on the geographic expansion of banks have a long history in the United States. Because the U.S. Constitution prevents states from issuing paper money and from taxing interstate commerce, the states used their power to grant bank charters to generate a substantial part of state revenues (Sylla, Legler, and Wallis, 1987). A state received no charter fees from banks incorporated in other states, so states prohibited out-of-state banks from operating in their territories--hence the prohibition on interstate banking originated in the states themselves and as a fiscal strategy rather than as a matter of optimal policy for banking and consumers. In addition, states restricted the ability of banks to expand geographically within their borders, effectively creating a series of local monopolies from which state governments could extract at least part of the rents. Some state legislatures even passed \"unit banking\" laws, which prevented a bank from having any branches at all.In addition to limiting branching within a state, states prohibited cross-state ownership of banks until the 1980s. Although some banks attempted to circumvent the McFadden Act by building multibank holding companies with operations in many states, the Congress stopped them with the 1956 amendments to the Banking Holding Company Act. Starting in 1978, states began to pass \"reciprocity\" laws in which a state would allow entry by bank holding companies from other states if, in return, bank holding companies from the state were permitted to enter the other states. By 1992, all states but Hawaii had passed such laws. The transition to full interstate banking was completed with passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which effectively permitted banks and holding companies to enter any state (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999).Consequences of Deregulation of Geographic Restrictions\\nDeregulation of restrictions on geographic expansion within the United States has led to a more consolidated, but not a less competitive, banking system--one that is increasingly characterized by better diversified and more-efficient banking organizations that operate across wider geographic areas. Moreover, this system has also has had positive effects on overall economic and employment growth. I believe that better cross-border integration of the European banking system would produce similar benefits in Europe.The consolidation of the banking system has involved mergers across local areas as well as within a single area (Pilloff, 2004). Antitrust policy in the United States has also likely contributed to the absence of a change in concentration in local urban and rural markets because mergers that would have significantly increased concentration at the local level were discouraged or were permitted only on the condition of appropriate divestitures.Effect on Efficiency and Pricing in the Banking Sector\\nI would now like to turn to the effect of geographic deregulation on efficiency and pricing in the banking sector. Regulatory changes appear to have led to meaningful improvements in the efficiency of banks, reductions in costs, and reductions in the prices of banking services. Studies show that non-interest costs, wages, and loan losses all declined in the aftermath of branching reform (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; Black and Strahan, 2001). These cost reductions led, in turn, to lower prices on loans, although deposit interest rates changed little.The mechanism for this improved performance seems to be changes in the market shares of banks after geographic deregulation (Stiroh and Strahan, 2003). Before regulatory reform, well-run banks faced binding constraints on the markets in which they could operate. When these constraints were lifted, however, assets were reallocated toward more-profitable banks as they gained the opportunity to increase market share, largely by acquiring less-profitable banks.The Real Economic Effect of Geographic Deregulation beyond Banking\\nThe consequences of a more efficient banking system can go beyond the banking industry to affect the real performance of the economy as a whole. It has been argued that efficient financial systems promote innovations; hence, better finance leads to faster growth (Schumpeter, 1969). This argument has been countered by assertions that the causality is reversed; economies with good growth prospects develop institutions to provide the funds necessary to support those good prospects (Robinson, 1952). In other words, the economy leads and finance follows.Recent theoretical developments have fleshed out two ways that good financial systems can lead to growth. Financial markets can matter by affecting the volume of savings available for investment and by increasing the productivity or quality of that investment. These theories show that an improvement in financial market efficiency can act as a lubricant to the engine of economic growth, allowing that engine to run faster. Of course other factors, including sound monetary and fiscal policies, remain critical; but it seems increasingly clear that well-functioning financial markets are also a central factor.Empirical research provides support for the view that financial market development can play an important role in driving long-run growth. For example, one study finds evidence of a positive correlation between the size and depth of an economy\\'s financial system and its future growth in per capita real income (King and Levine, 1993).Although this evidence is appealing, it cannot rule out the possibility that financial development and growth are simultaneously driven by some common factor, such as good political or legal institutions, that may be difficult to fully hold constant in the empirical analysis.The state-by-state deregulation of branching and banking restrictions provides a useful laboratory for investigating the effect of better banking on economic growth. Because states share a common legal system and broadly similar institutional environments, we can investigate the response of the state economy to policy changes that lead to more-efficient finance. A number of studies give a consistent answer: State economic performance measured in a variety of ways improves after the deregulation of geographic restrictions on banking (for example, Kroszner and Strahan, 2006; Stiroh and Strahan, 2003; Black and Strahan, 2001; Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; and Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996). These results have important implications for the policy debate in Europe and around the globe.First, after controlling for other factors, data on state-level economic performance over the period 1972 to 1992 suggests that state-level branching deregulation spurred faster economic growth (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996). Second, evidence from 1976 to 1994 shows that state-level employment growth accelerated after the deregulation of intrastate branching as well as after the deregulation of interstate banking (Kroszner and Strahan, 2006).This finding of better state-level economic stability after geographic deregulation may reflect the fact that state economies became more insulated from shocks to their own banks. In a non-integrated banking system, such as the one we had in the United States before the 1970s, shocks to bank capital lead to reductions in lending, thereby worsening local downturns. In contrast, with integration, a state can import bank capital from other regions when its banks are down, thus continuing to fund projects with a positive net present value.According to this explanation, the correlation of local measures of economic performance or loan availability with the financial capital of local banks ought to weaken with geographic deregulation and integration. Recent evidence seems to support this idea (Kroszner and Strahan, 2006; Morgan, Rime, and Strahan, 2004). Before the advent of geographic deregulation, there was a nearly one-to-one correspondence between state-level loan growth and state-level bank capital growth. This link weakened significantly after interstate deregulation. Similarly, we also observe a weakened correlation between the growth of local employment and that of local bank capital, although the effect is less dramatic than the effect on loan growth. In short, banking integration appears to have salutary effects on business cycles by insulating the local economy from the ups and downs of its local banking system, and vice versa.Lessons for Europe\\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I think that the U.S. experience with the change in its banking structure holds potentially valuable lessons for Europe. In my view, if Europeans can prevent nonprudential, noncompetitive, political concerns from impeding cross-border, intra-European bank mergers, then Europe will be likely to enjoy benefits similar to those enjoyed in the United States when interstate banking restrictions were removed. To recap, these benefits are likely to beBarriers to Greater Banking Integration in Europe\\nOf course, some of you may be thinking that I am overlooking significant structural obstacles to cross-border mergers in Europe and that such obstacles may make such integration less beneficial, on net. I have, however, already mentioned what I view as the largest obstacle--political opposition, which makes integration less likely to happen (but not less beneficial when it occurs). I hope that I have given pause to opponents of such integration by pointing out the benefits that the United States has reaped from reducing geographic restrictions on banking.Another obstacle is posed by differences in language and culture, which are clearly greater across European countries than they are across U.S. states, and these differences can create nonregulatory barriers. I have no easy answers for reducing such barriers. However, I would point out that a few truly global banks seem to have succeeded in overcoming them.I hope that my remarks on the U.S. experience have highlighted the potential gains that, in my opinion, would be likely to follow a similar liberalization in Europe. I want to remind you of the words of Commissioner McCreevy, which I cited at the outset: \"Protectionism denies everyone in Europe the economic benefits of market integration--higher growth, and more jobs.\" I hope that the evidence I have provided here will help make liberalization in Europe more likely so that Europeans will not be denied the benefits that we have experienced in the United States.ReferencesBarth, James R., Gerald Caprio, and Ross Levine (2002). “Bank Regulation and Supervision: What Works Best?” unpublished paper, January 2002.Cetorelli, Nicola, and Michele Gambera (2001). “Bank Structure, Financial Dependence and Growth: International Evidence from Industrial Data,” Journal of Finance, vol. 56, pp. 617-48.Jayaratne, Jith, and Philip E.

Today, I will offer my perspectives about risk management in general and then focus on enterprise-wide compliance-risk management, an area of risk management that has been receiving a good deal of attention lately. Risk, to state the obvious, is inherent in all activities in your industry. With the benefit of hindsight, the financial services regulators and the industry have been trying to distill the lessons learned from recent internal control breakdowns in the financial services sector. My remarks today will delve into some of the implications those breakdowns have for compliance-risk management.Over the past two decades, we have seen remarkable changes in the global financial system. Among these changes are (1) the financial sector\\'s increasing reliance on risk-transfer strategies and (2) the dizzying array of new products being offered to customers. Investment options continue to proliferate, as new investment products are developed and alternative investments such as hedge funds, which now total $1 trillion by some estimates, continue to grow.Risk Management in GeneralOne of the biggest risks facing businesses and governments today is the risk of not preparing for how the world will change over the next five years. Note that I said \"preparing\" for change and not \"predicting\" change. Predicting change in a specific way is highly speculative, but planning for the inevitability of change is prudent management. A key question to ask is whether your organizations have the tools and risk-management processes that will allow them to cope with inevitable changes. As fiduciary and investment risk managers, you pay considerable attention to measuring and monitoring the risks your institutions face, and to managing and controlling those risks. You probably also devote considerable time and resources to keeping abreast of the latest advances in finance and risk management. And if you are like most risk managers, you are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with your colleagues and competitors, because our world--especially those aspects of our lives influenced by science and technology--is changing at an exponential rate. In this regard, one of the biggest risks faced by risk managers is not being sufficiently prepared for the future. As Yogi Berra once said, \"The future ain\\'t what it used to be.\" Yet risk managers face the challenge of ensuring their organizations are sufficiently prepared for whatever events the future holds.It\\'s true that we cannot predict the future in a specific way. But if the past is any guide, we can comfortably expect that new technologies will enable us to overcome problems and challenges that today appear to be insurmountable. At the same time, however, innovation will bring new problems and challenges. As risk managers, the key question for us to answer is \"How can we best cope with the dramatic changes and challenges that will inevitably occur?\" Preparation is the easy answer, but foresight and discipline are also needed. At a fundamental level, managers need to make sure that their organizations have in place the risk-management policies, processes, and technologies to properly measure, monitor, and control their risk exposures. Beyond the basics, the next imperative is to do some hard thinking about the future. More specifically, managers need to conduct scenario analysis and scenario planning--and this is one area of risk management that is sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously. Scenario analysis and scenario planning are difficult; they cannot be done on the fly.For many financial organizations, scenario analysis starts and ends with quantitative exercises that measure exposures to specific risk factors, such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads. To realize the full benefits of scenario analysis, however, the analysis must move beyond quantitative exercises. A comprehensive scenario analysis should encompass a thoughtful and thorough analysis of potential, but plausible, major changes in the economic, political, and social landscape. What are these changes? How will they affect your business? How will you respond to them if they occur? This analysis is the primary responsibility of risk management.But scenario analysis is not the end goal. Something must be done with the results of the analysis. Management must ask itself whether the organization needs to restructure its balance sheet or modify its current risk-management strategy in order to be prepared for scenarios that may unfold in the near future. This strategizing is at the core of effective scenario planning. Some key scenarios you should consider as part of your scenario planning include how forces such as continued globalization, technological advances, and competition from product innovation will affect your particular line of business. For example, globalization makes group management and risk aggregation more challenging, and the increasing power of information technology creates both new opportunities and new risks. Furthermore, new products and new distribution channels are likely to affect your business and risk profile.The fiduciary and investment world has not been immune to problems caused by ineffective controls. Well-publicized accounts of late trading and market timing at mutual fund firms, and the related investigations, have touched many businesses including banking, securities, and insurance firms. These types of compliance failures result in sanctions or financial loss and adversely affect the reputation and franchise value of a firm. As a result, we are seeing an increasing focus on enterprise-wide compliance-risk management systems.The business lines and activities of financial services firms can cross many legal entities, making it more difficult for a supervisory agency acting alone to determine what went wrong and what processes may need to be improved. In some of the mutual fund cases, the Federal Reserve, as the consolidated supervisor of the relevant banking organization, worked closely with the primary bank regulator and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate control breakdowns. The agencies exchanged information in order to compare their findings. Findings from SEC examinations of the broker-dealers, investment advisers, and mutual fund distributors were analyzed together with findings from targeted joint reviews of the bank holding companies and the banks conducted by the Federal Reserve and the primary bank regulators. The banking agency reviews were focused on corporate-wide compliance practices and bank lending practices.My observation is that the significant deficiencies in mutual fund practices resulted from a combination of factors and a breakdown in controls. First, mutual fund activities were not being effectively overseen by their mutual fund boards. Second, there were strong financial incentives at certain firms to increase the profitability of mutual fund activities, but the legal and reputational risks of these incentives were not appropriately addressed. Third, a lack of adequate employee training resulted in employees deviating from standard procedures, in order to accommodate certain large customers. For example, in some cases, employees granted key customers a routine waiver of redemption fees, which allowed them to engage in market timing at the expense of other fund shareholders. A stronger corporate compliance program would have enabled a local compliance officer to identify these problems and bring them to the attention of higher-level managers within the corporation.Based on our experience in investigating control breaches in these mutual fund cases, I would like to highlight a few lessons learned. One of the most obvious to me is the need to critically evaluate unusual client relationships that require variances from standard procedures. There is an additional red flag if a high percentage of compensation is derived from a single client. Additionally, organizations should have a formal process for reviewing and approving unique products, customers, and services at the inception of the client relationship. And, finally, it is always a good idea to shine some light on areas historically labeled \"low risk\" to validate that assessment. The low occurrence of loss from an activity should not be the only factor considered when assessing risk.Compliance-Risk Management FrameworksAs these lessons suggest, compliance risk can arise when the organization fails to comply with laws, regulations, or standards of conduct. Fortunately, various models are available to help organizations manage compliance risk more effectively. A number of banking institutions have installed, or are in the process of enhancing, comprehensive, corporate-level compliance-risk management functions. Many organizations are also bolstering their compliance-risk management programs by upgrading their compliance management information systems, which allows for more-integrated and transparent analysis and monitoring. An enterprise-wide approach to compliance-risk management has proven valuable in areas such as Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance, information security, privacy, transactions with affiliates, and conflicts of interest.A common trend for both large and small organizations is the transition away from task-oriented compliance programs to process-oriented compliance programs. Process-oriented programs require compliance to be tested and validated on an ongoing basis. In addition, fragmented and duplicative compliance activities are being scrapped for those that enable an understanding of compliance across the organization. This is not to say, however, that local compliance activities in business units are obsolete but rather they should be part of an integrated, global program. This promotes consistency in expectations, documentation, assessments, and reporting.An effective enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program is flexible to respond to change, and it is tailored to an organization\\'s corporate strategies, business activities, and external environment. In addition, an effective enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program requires strong board and senior management oversight.The board of directors and senior management have different but complementary roles in ensuring the success of an organization\\'s enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program. The board of directors is responsible for establishing a strong compliance culture that makes compliance an integral part of day-to-day operations; the board then entrusts this responsibility to managers and staff at all levels of the organization. A strong compliance culture encourages employees to raise concerns about compliance risks and the need for additional or improved controls.ConclusionOur review of industry best practices and an analysis of the experience of other industries suggests that organizations need to supplement their enterprise-wide compliance-risk management systems with strategic and dynamic thinking. To prepare for what may be ahead, organizations should draw not only on past experience but also employ quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis and planning. To quote former Chairman Greenspan, \"The advent of sophisticated risk models has not made people with gray hair, or none, wholly obsolete.\" Thank you for the invitation to speak today. I always find these forums very informative and useful, in part because they keep me apprised of the issues currently on the minds of bankers. And I hope you agree that these conferences are beneficial to the broader dialogue between bankers and regulators. I plan to focus on several issues that I believe are of interest to this group, including commercial real estate, nontraditional residential mortgages, and proposed changes to regulatory capital rules. With these initiatives, supervisors are trying to emphasize our broader goal of improving risk management at banks, while not dictating in which businesses banks should engage or to what extent.If you look at their balance sheets and income statements, you will see that community banks are thriving. As Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke noted recently, capital, earnings, and asset quality are improving for banks of all sizes, but particularly for community banks. Nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and loan-loss provisions for community banks have been at low levels in recent years. And community banks remain profitable. The continuing strength of this part of the financial sector is also visible in supervisory ratings, with the number of problem community banks at historical lows.But of course all of you know that there are still potential risks on the horizon, and supervisors are paid to make sure that bankers manage those risks properly to maintain the safety and soundness of the banking system. So while the banking industry is doing well of late, we believe there are a few recent regulatory proposals to which bankers--including community bankers--should pay attention.Commercial Real EstateIt is perhaps an understatement to say that those gathered here today are aware of the proposed commercial real estate (CRE) guidance recently issued by the U.S. banking agencies. Indeed, we have received hundreds of comment letters on the proposed guidance so far: the comment period ends April 13. I will be honest and say that I have not had a chance to read all of the comments. Naturally, we welcome these comments, since we were looking for extensive feedback when we issued the proposed guidance in the first place.At this point, I would like to underscore that the proposed guidance is intended to encompass \"true\" CRE loans. It is not focused on commercial loans for which a bank looks to a borrower\\'s cashflow as the source of repayment and accepts real estate collateral as a secondary source of repayment. That is, the proposed guidance addresses bank lending on commercial real estate projects where repayment is dependent on third party rental income, or the sale, refinancing or permanent financing of the property. These are \"true\" commercial real estate loans for which repayment depends upon the condition and performance of the real estate market.I would also like to mention up front that the proposed guidance is not intended to cap or restrict banks\\' participation in the CRE sector, but rather to remind institutions that proper risk management and appropriate capital are essential elements of a sound CRE lending strategy. In fact, many institutions already have both of these elements in place.Commercial real estate lending played a central role in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s and has historically been a highly volatile asset class. Past problems in CRE have generally come at times when the broader market encounters difficulties. Therefore, banks should not be surprised by the emphasis of the proposed CRE guidance on the importance of portfolio risk management and concentrations. One reason why supervisors are proposing CRE guidance at this point is that we are seeing high and rising concentrations of CRE loans relative to capital. For certain groups of banks, such as those with assets between $100 million and $1 billion, average CRE concentrations are about 300 percent of total capital. This compares to a concentration level of about 150 percent in the late 1980s and early 1990s for this same bank group.While banks\\' underwriting standards are now generally stronger than in the 1980s and 1990s, the agencies are proposing the guidance now to reinforce sound portfolio-management principles that a bank should have in place when pursuing a commercial real estate lending strategy. A bank should both be monitoring the performance on an individual loan basis as well as on a collective basis for loans collateralized by similar property types or in the same markets. When a bank targets commercial real estate lending as a primary business activity, it needs to consider that the risk exposure to the performance of its total CRE loan portfolio--the concentration risk--depends upon broader real estate market conditions. For example, if a bank has several borrowers with similar projects that encounter problems--such as longer absorption periods, higher marketing costs, or higher vacancy rates--weaknesses in the broader real estate market can have a cascading effect on the quality of a bank\\'s CRE portfolio as real estate values erode.Some institutions\\' strategic- and capital-planning processes may not adequately acknowledge the risks from their CRE concentrations. This is particularly important, since CRE lending in recent years has occurred under fairly benign credit conditions and, naturally, those conditions are unlikely to continue indefinitely. The ability of banks with significant concentrations to weather difficult market conditions will depend heavily on their risk management processes and the level of capitalization. From a risk-management and capital perspective, institutions generally should focus on the emerging conditions in their real estate markets, the potential cumulative impact on their portfolios if conditions deteriorate, and significantly employ other exercises to help identify CRE vulnerabilities. Of course, such exercises should vary according to the size of the organization and the level of the concentration. All of these are key elements of a sound strategy to manage concentrations.In evaluating the impact of their CRE concentrations, bankers should also pay attention to geographic factors. Many banks conduct successful CRE lending within a certain geographic area, but problems can arise when banks begin to lend outside their market or \"footprint\" for which they normally have better market intelligence. In recent years, supervisors have observed banks lending outside their established footprint, to maintain a customer relationship, into real estate markets with which they have less experience. The challenge is heightened when the borrower is also venturing into a new market. These practices led to significant losses in prior CRE credit downturns.I noted that CRE underwriting appears substantially better compared to the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, we have noticed some recent slippage. Therefore, the proposed CRE guidance underscores the existing interagency guidance on real estate lending standards. That is, it offers some reminders about risk-management practices for individual exposures. In order to attract new business and sustain loan volume, banks may occasionally be inclined to make some compromises and concessions to borrowers. As supervisors, we want to ensure that loan-to-value standards and debt-service-coverage ratios are meeting the organization\\'s policies--and that there is not an undue increase in the exceptions to those standards and ratios. We also continue to monitor whether lenders routinely adjust covenants, lengthen maturities, or reduce collateral requirements. To be clear, we have not yet seen underwriting standards fall to unsatisfactory levels on a broad scale, but we are concerned about some of the downward trend in these standards.Furthermore, no element of the proposed guidance is intended to act as a \"trigger\" or \"hard limit\" for immediate cutback or reversal of CRE lending; rather, it should be viewed as a reminder to institutions that certain risk management standards are vitally important for banks involved in the business. Additionally, if the agencies finalize the proposed guidance, they intend to use the proposed thresholds in the guidance only as a \"first cut\" or \"screen\" to identify institutions that may have heightened CRE concentration risk. The thresholds are intended to serve as benchmarks to identify cases for further review. In some cases, supervisors, after more careful review, may actually find that given the characteristics of its CRE portfolio, an institution has sound risk management and is holding appropriate capital. In general, the proposed guidance is intended to be applied quite flexibly and in a manner consistent with the size and complexity of each organization.Nontraditional Residential MortgagesYou are probably also aware that the U.S. banking agencies recently issued proposed supervisory guidance on nontraditional mortgages, for which the comment period ended March 29. We appreciate the extensive feedback from the industry and others. The agencies are now in the process of reviewing the comment letters and deciding on a way forward. While the main focus of the proposed guidance is on banks\\' ability to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products, the proposed guidance also addresses consumer protection, which is what I would like to focus on today.As outlined in our proposed guidance, nontraditional mortgages contain aspects of complexity, which could make it difficult for consumers to understand all the possible consequences of borrowing. In general, bankers need to be especially alert to developing easily understood disclosures as they introduce more innovative and complex products, and as they market them to broader customer segments rather than the original niche customer. The elements relating to consumer protection in the proposed nontraditional mortgage guidance are included because we think addressing these issues is consistent with good risk management.Nontraditional mortgages typically allow borrowers to defer payment of principal and, sometimes, interest. These products include interest-only mortgages and payment option adjustable-rate mortgages (or ARMs), which have been available for many years. They have recently become increasingly popular, often combined with practices such as reduced documentation of income and assets in evaluating applicants\\' creditworthiness.Although these products can be beneficial for some borrowers, today these products are being offered to a wider spectrum of consumers. Some of these consumers may not understand the associated risks. For example, there could be a substantial increase in the monthly payment, or \"payment shock\" that could occur when the loan\\'s interest rate increases after a low \"teaser-rate\" period and if the market interest rate index rises through the term of the loan. In addition, consumers may not be aware that payments can increase considerably when a loan begins to fully amortize after an interest-only period. They also may not understand the full impact of negative amortization, including the fact that they may be repaying more than they initially borrowed.The Board\\'s Truth in Lending regulations require creditors to provide consumers with disclosures about the loan terms, including a schedule of payments. For interest-only and payment option ARMs, the payment schedule shows consumers how their payments will increase to include amortization of the principal. The proposed interagency guidance includes recommended practices that describe how institutions can use their promotional materials to provide information about the features and risks of these products, especially the risk of payment shock. For example, the guidance recommends that institutions inform consumers about the maximum monthly payment they could be required to pay once interest rate caps and negative-amortization caps have been reached. The proposed guidance also lists recommended practices to address other risks. When negative amortization is possible, the guidance suggests that institutions alert consumers about the consequences of increasing principal balances and decreasing home equity. If both reduced- and full-documentation loan programs are offered, the draft guidance advises institutions to inform consumers if they will pay a pricing premium for the reduced-documentation loan. When institutions provide monthly statements with payment options, they are urged to include information that enables borrowers to make well-informed choices--information that explains each payment option and the impact of each choice.The draft guidance also urges institutions to ensure that their advertisements, promotional materials, and oral communications are consistent with the product terms and that these communications provide clear, balanced, and timely information to consumers about the risks. This is important so that consumers have the information they need at critical decision times, such as when selecting a loan product or choosing a specific payment option each month. In general, bankers should ensure that borrowers are aware of the range of outcomes with a nontraditional mortgage.We are very pleased that the substantial time spent on the Basel II effort has culminated in this important achievement. We also recognize the significance of the NPR to the industry, Congress, and others who have waited for more detail on the proposed rulemaking. We look forward to receiving comments on the NPR; they will contribute to our assessment of Basel II objectives and help us determine whether the NPR in fact produces a prudent, risk-sensitive regulatory capital regime. In some areas, the agencies are still grappling with the correct approach. For this reason, the NPR contains a number of requests for feedback on specific topics. All of this will help us as we continue to develop the framework. But before commenting further on the NPR and the U.S. Basel II process, I would like to reiterate our rationale for pursuing Basel II.Basel II ProposalsThe current Basel I capital framework, adopted nearly twenty years ago, has served us well. For the vast majority of U.S. banks, Basel I continues to provide a useful measure of regulatory capital, while not being particularly burdensome. However, Basel I has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks that are offering ever more complex and sophisticated products and services. In other words, the current Basel I capital requirements have over the past decade begun to deviate substantially from the risk profiles of large, complex organizations. We need a better capital framework for these large, internationally active banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework. And from a financial stability perspective it is in everyone\\'s interest to have regulatory capital measures at large, complex banks more accurately reflect their actual risks.One of the major improvements in Basel II is the closer linking of capital requirements and risk. The current Basel I measures are not very risk-sensitive and do not provide bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace with meaningful measures of risk at large, complex organizations. Under Basel I, it is possible for two banks, with dramatically different risk profiles in their commercial loan portfolios, to have the same regulatory capital requirement. And under Basel I, a bank\\'s capital requirement does not reflect deterioration in asset quality. Moreover, the balance-sheet focus of Basel I does not adequately capture risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions and fee-based activities--for example, the operational risk embedded in many of the services from which many large U.S. institutions generate a growing portion of their revenues. For large, complex banks, the costs of mismeasuring regulatory capital requirements are much higher and, therefore, there is a greater need to amend the rules for these institutions--this need is the impetus for Basel II.In addition to making regulatory capital measures more meaningful, Basel II should make the financial system safer by substantially improving risk management at banks. Basel II builds on the existing risk-management approaches of well-managed banks and creates incentives for banks to move toward leading-edge risk-measurement and risk-management practices. By providing a consistent framework for all banks to use, supervisors will be better able to identify banks whose risk management and risk levels differ significantly from other banks. By communicating these differences to banks, management will be able to benchmark their risk assessments, models, and processes in a more detailed and regular manner. We have already seen some progress in risk management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of preparations for Basel II. The new framework is also much more consistent with the internal capital measures that institutions use to manage their business.I hope it is clear from the NPR and other statements made by the agencies that we are committed to ongoing, detailed analysis to ensure that U.S. implementation of Basel II achieves its goal: establishing a strong and risk-sensitive base of minimum regulatory capital. First of all, the U.S. agencies included in the NPR a proposed timetable and set of transition safeguards that are more rigorous than those set forth in the 2004 Basel II framework. For instance, the U.S. agencies are proposing three transition periods, during which an individual institution\\'s Basel II minimum required capital will not be permitted to fall below certain percentages of its capital requirement under the general risk-based capital rules.At several points during the transition to Basel II, the agencies intend to conduct thorough analyses of each institution\\'s Basel II capital results and Basel II\\'s impact on aggregate minimum required capital in the U.S. banking system. The U.S. regulators are united in their belief that no bank should be permitted to operate under Basel II until it has proven itself ready to do so. In other words, we plan to have very high standards for Basel II qualification. For instance, a bank will be able to move from the parallel run to the first transitional floor period only after its primary supervisor has given it permission to do so--and only after that supervisor has thoroughly evaluated the bank\\'s risk-management methodologies and its ability to calculate minimum regulatory capital using the new framework. Similarly, a bank will only be allowed to move to each successive floor, as well as to the full Basel II minimum capital calculation without floors, upon a finding by the primary supervisor that it is ready, following a rigorous qualification process.To reiterate, during and after the transition to Basel II, supervisors plan to rely on ongoing, detailed analyses to continuously evaluate the results of the new framework and ensure prudent levels of capital. And to be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is critical to the health of our banking system. We also believe that Basel II will help us continue to ensure that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that serve as an appropriate cushion against unexpected losses.As we have mentioned before, we will continue to use existing prudential measures to complement Basel II. For example, the current leverage ratio requirement--a ratio of capital to total assets--will remain unchanged for all banks, whether or not they are subject to the Basel II framework. Also, supervisors will continue to enforce existing prompt-corrective-action rules in response to declines in capital. Both the leverage ratio and prompt-corrective-action rules are fully consistent with Basel II.Proposals to Amend Basel IOf course, those of you here today have also been following discussions about possible changes--beyond Basel II--to the existing regulatory capital rules. First of all, we expect only one or two dozen banks to move to Basel II in the near term. The vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely under Basel I as amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework has already been amended more than twenty-five times in response to changes in the banking environment and a better understanding of the risks of individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules.These proposals to amend Basel I, also known as \"Basel IA,\" are still at an early stage. Last fall, the U.S. banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) that outlined suggested Basel I changes. In part, these proposed changes are meant to address concerns about the potential adverse competitive effects of Basel II.We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules will apply. That is, in Basel I amendments we are trying to find the right balance between added risk sensitivity and low burden. As you are aware, this is not necessarily the easiest balance to find. For example, there may be a desire to tie regulatory capital measures more closely to risk, but only by expanding the use of factors that determine regulatory risk weights. However, if we expand the number of factors that are used--for example, loan-to-value measures, credit scores, and external credit ratings--that will likely increase the burden for calculating regulatory capital. In short, we are faced with a tradeoff. And some of the comment letters received so far address this very point. Naturally, institutions differ with respect to this tradeoff, with some wanting greater risk sensitivity at the cost of greater burden, and some wanting just a little more risk sensitivity with little or no additional burden. Of course, there are also those that would like much more risk sensitivity with no additional burden, but that just does not seem possible in this case. As we develop the NPR for Basel I amendments, the agencies will have to analyze very carefully where we want to end up on the risk-sensitivity-versus-burden tradeoff. And of course we expect to solicit comments on that tradeoff.Additionally, we recognize the need for full transparency about the Basel II proposal and proposed Basel I amendments. For that reason, we intend to have overlapping comment periods for the NPRs of both proposed Basel II and the proposed Basel I amendments, so that banks and others can review and comment on both NPRs at approximately the same time. In particular, bankers from potential opt-in institutions and those not planning to move to Basel II can evaluate the potential impact of Basel II in light of the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping timeframes. At this point, we are still reviewing the comments received on the ANPR for amendments to Basel I. The comment period ended in mid-January. The agencies are developing their proposals for Basel I amendments, based on comments received, and hope to have a Basel I NPR by summer.Finally, I would like to underscore that the U.S. agencies welcome any and all comments on these documents. Accordingly, our proposals could change on the basis of comments we receive or new information we gather. We know that this can be frustrating to some. Still given the breadth and depth of these proposals, it is critical that we consider all viewpoints. To date, comments from bankers--at all sizes of institutions--have been quite helpful. We request that you continue providing feedback on all the regulatory capital proposals we are contemplating.ConclusionI hope you found my remarks about recent regulatory initiatives informative. Naturally, bankers may be somewhat concerned about the impact these initiatives--even proposed guidance--could have on their business. We hear your concerns about \"piling on,\" but I think it is helpful to remember that our job as regulators is to ensure that the United States has a safe and sound banking system. In other words, we are in the business of monitoring \"downside risk\" to the financial system, so we must act appropriately when we see possibly excessive risk-taking or inappropriate risk management, controls, or capital. While most U.S. banks today operate in a safe and sound manner, we must always be vigilant of future problems.I hope it is clear that we are sensitive to the regulatory burden that bankers face; that is one reason why we often issue guidance first as proposals, requesting comments. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is quite responsive to regulatory burden, as evidenced by the recent Senate testimony of Governor Kohn on the subject. Overall, we believe that banks can remain profitable while still adhering to the standards set by banking regulators. And when we propose changes in our policies or guidance, we continue to listen carefully to industry comments and concerns.Thank you. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the business leaders of Oklahoma City. The Federal Reserve has deep roots in this community: The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has had a Branch here since 1920. Consistent with the experience of most other enterprises these days, the Federal Reserve is having to change the way we do business in response to rapid changes in technology. We can see the effects of these changes on the payment system every day and all around us as we make and receive payments that depend less and less on the use of checks. To hold down costs, we have been required to reduce the number of our offices delivering payments services to banks, including check and cash operations at Oklahoma City.But closing those operations by no means implies that we are reducing our commitment to the community. Indeed, Tom Hoenig and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City are taking steps to strengthen our roots here. Our most important ties to local communities have never been primarily through the services we deliver to their banks. Rather they are established through the exchange of information between those communities and the Federal Reserve, and the Oklahoma City Branch will remain our eyes and ears in this region. Tom will continue to bring to our policy deliberations the information he gathers from Tyree Minner and his colleagues on the board of directors of the Oklahoma City Branch, from Bob Funk and his colleagues on the head office board, and from many other contacts in the region. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Oklahoma City Branch are increasing their efforts to reach out to this community to make sure that we are listening as effectively as possible to your impressions of the current economic circumstances, to explain our policies, to help educate the public in the use of the increasingly complex financial instruments available to them, and to work with community leaders to identify strategies that will help sustain a vibrant economy. The Board of Governors in Washington strongly supports these efforts by Kansas City and other Reserve Banks to deepen their ties to their communities, and I am pleased to be here as tangible evidence of that support.On balance, the economy has been performing quite well in recent quarters, with growth strong and underlying inflation stable despite the considerable rise in energy prices over the past few years. I say \"on balance\" because a number of unusual factors have been influencing the pattern of economic activity lately, adding to the normal difficulty of discerning underlying trends from inherently volatile data and other information. These factors include not only last year\\'s devastating hurricanes but also the unusually warm weather in the early part of this year, which very likely provided a fillip to housing construction and consumer spending. Smoothing through these events, however, the economy has been expanding at a pretty good clip by historical standards--probably an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent since midyear 2005.Several factors have propelled reasonably strong economic growth. A critical element has been supportive financial conditions. Despite the tightening of monetary policy that began in mid-2004, short-term interest rates were at fairly low levels until recently, and the effects of those low rates have continued to spur household and business spending. In addition, although longer-term yields have moved up notably in recent weeks, they too have been low by historical standards. Moreover, credit to businesses and households has remained readily available at narrow spreads in markets and on favorable terms and conditions at banks, reflecting, in part, robust earnings and strong balance sheets at businesses along with good performance on outstanding household and business loans.The pace of economic growth in the United States has also been supported by a firming of activity abroad and the associated increases in demand for our exports. Among industrial countries, expansion of output has become more firmly established in both Japan and the euro area, while growth continues at a solid pace in the United Kingdom and Canada. Furthermore, economic growth in most of the emerging economies of Asia has been robust. U.S. exports were disrupted by last summer\\'s hurricanes in the Gulf, but smoothing through this volatility, exports appear to have been contributing substantially to the growth of gross domestic product (GDP).Our economy has been able to register this good performance despite rising energy prices. This audience knows well that since late 2003 the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, for delivery at Cushing, has soared from about $30 per barrel to nearly $70 recently. Nonetheless, the rise in energy prices has apparently had only a limited negative effect on the national economy. Energy costs are not nearly as important today as they once were. Since the 1970s, the energy intensity of production in the United States has fallen dramatically; indeed, on an inflation-adjusted basis, it takes roughly half as many Btu of energy to produce a dollar of GDP today than it did at the time of the 1973 oil crisis. This sharply reduced share of energy costs in total business expenses has likely limited the influence of these costs on profits, on overall consumer prices and real income, and on the economy more generally. A rough estimate puts the reduction in real GDP growth from the increases in energy prices since late 2003 at between 1/2 percent and 1 percent per year. Of course, reactions to higher energy prices are hard to predict, but the measured response of activity over the past couple of years suggests that the most recent price increases will have, at most, only a small effect on economic growth during this year.The good performance of the economy has led to a further narrowing in the margin of unutilized resources. For example, the Federal Reserve\\'s measure of capacity utilization in manufacturing has moved up 2 percentage points during the past nine months, to around 80-1/2 percent, a touch above its longer-run average. Similarly, the unemployment rate has fallen almost 1/2 percentage point from early 2005 to around 4-3/4 percent last month.Nevertheless, the underlying rate of inflation has remained moderate. Headline inflation, of course, has been boosted by the jump in energy prices. However, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on prices for non-energy goods and services. The inflation rate for prices of consumer goods and services excluding food and energy, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been running a bit under 2 percent, only about 1/2 percentage point above its rate two years ago before the spurt in energy prices began.Inflation has been restrained, in part, by the margin of slack in labor and product markets that has persisted through much of this period. Another reason for this favorable outcome is that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. For example, the median expected inflation rate during the next five to ten years, as reported in the University of Michigan\\'s survey of consumers, has barely edged up in recent years, even as short-term inflation has been boosted by rising energy prices. Meanwhile, inflation compensation for investors implied by the spreads between the rates on nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury notes at both five- and ten-year maturities also has not shown any tendency to move higher on balance.In recent years, declining prices of imports and the threat of import competition have also probably held down costs and prices to a degree. Moreover, increases in compensation costs have generally been modest. To be sure, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers have been accelerating in recent quarters. However, the broadest measures of compensation have not picked up, suggesting that competition in labor markets has been intense. Nonetheless, with labor markets tightening, some pickup in compensation increases for the broad measures would not be surprising. Nor would a pickup necessarily be inflationary, given the very good growth in labor productivity that we have experienced in recent years.Despite the relatively moderate increases in prices and costs that we have observed lately, the capacity utilization rate and the unemployment rate have recently reached zones that on occasion in the past have been associated with the beginnings of upward pressure on inflation. Of course, the past is not always a good guide to the future, in part because a great deal of uncertainty surrounds the relationship of resource utilization and inflation. For instance, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labor or production resources; consequently, we can never be certain what level of activity represents the full utilization of capacity.In addition, measurement issues aside, the empirical evidence of the past half-century suggests that the relationship between utilization and inflation can shift over time. Unfortunately, we typically are only imperfectly aware of the changes and their magnitudes in real time. In the 1990s, that relationship was affected by, among other things, changing trends in the growth rate of productivity and innovations in the structure of labor markets, such as increased use of temporary help supply.These uncertainties mean that we, as policymakers, need to keep not only an open mind about estimates of the economy\\'s potential but also a close eye on the various indicators of costs and prices so that we can recognize incipient price developments and react to them as early as possible. But we also must recognize that, by the time evidence of accelerating prices becomes definitive, containing inflation pressures could entail disruptive economic adjustments. So despite the uncertainties, we must evaluate all the evidence and make our best judgments about the oncoming risks to sustained good economic performance. In the current circumstances, as the Federal Open Market Committee has said, the economic climate appears to be one in which further increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.The available evidence suggests that the pace of economic expansion may moderate a little from its average over recent quarters, keeping resource utilization in line with recent levels. Maintaining economic growth around this pace will likely reflect a balancing of opposing forces. The rise in interest rates we have experienced will tend to restrain demand, offsetting the effects of sustained economic expansion in our trading partners and the reduced drag on U.S. growth from oil prices, assuming that those prices roughly flatten out as participants in futures markets seem to expect.If the past is any guide, the effect of rising interest rates is likely to be felt most visibly in housing markets. The rate for a thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage is up 70 basis points from its level in the middle of last year, and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages have risen more than 100 basis points over the same period. In addition, house prices have increased considerably relative to rents, incomes, and returns on alternative assets. Already there have been signs that housing demand has begun to moderate. Sales of both new and existing homes are down substantially from their levels last summer, and information on mortgage applications and pending home sales point to further softening in the next few months. With demand slowing, house prices also seem likely to decelerate. Indeed, we are beginning to see hints of moderation in some of the data on housing prices.As a consequence, spending for new housing construction, after contributing nearly 1/2 percentage point to overall GDP growth last year, may not increase much this year. Moreover, the slowdown in house price increases could well hold back growth in consumption spending on a wide variety of goods and services. The rapid run-up in prices over the past few years and hence in household wealth, perhaps combined with the increasing ease of tapping that wealth, probably has been a major reason that households have been saving so little of their current flow of income. As house-price appreciation slows, the personal saving rate likely should begin a gradual ascent.To be candid, however, the behavior of the housing market and the response of spending are among the great uncertainties about the economic outlook. I have sketched a benign scenario of gradual adjustment that lines up very nicely with the Federal Reserve\\'s assessment that overall growth should slow to a sustainable pace. But our ability to predict asset prices is very limited, especially when the trajectory of those prices is shifting, as that of house prices appears to be doing right now. Moreover, we have particular difficulty in assessing how consumers will respond to changes in their perceptions of future capital gains and actual home prices. The housing market and its effects on spending will be among the areas that Tom and I and our colleagues on the FOMC will be monitoring most closely as we try to discern the emerging pattern of economic activity and inflation.At this time, even with housing markets cooling, the fundamentals remain favorable for solid gains over the coming months and quarters in both consumer spending and business investment. In part, that assessment reflects the sizable increases in employment that we have been seeing over the past year or so. Just last week, the Labor Department reported that payroll employment rose 211,000 in March. If the growth of aggregate demand moderates as we expect, increases in employment should also slow but still be sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market. Moreover, the gains in wage and salary income associated with those employment increases should provide ongoing support to household spending. The purchasing power of those gains will go further than it has in recent years if, as anticipated in futures markets, energy prices level out.Meanwhile, in the business sector, order books for nondefense capital goods are full, sales prospects appear good, profits have been strong, balance sheets are in healthy shape, and companies are flush with cash. As the growth of consumption eases back a little, so too should the increase in capital spending as firms come to anticipate slower growth in sales. But judging from rising global commodity prices and equity valuations abroad, foreign demand looks to be increasing, and rising exports should offset some of the scaling back of domestic sales prospects. In addition, technological advances will continue to boost demand for capital equipment by reducing its costs and increasing its usefulness in improving efficiency.If, as I anticipate, economic growth moderates a touch and pressures on labor and product markets do not intensify substantially further, I believe that underlying inflation should remain roughly stable. That sanguine picture is reinforced if crude oil prices do, in fact, turn out to be relatively flat over the remainder of this year. Such a flattening of oil prices would reduce headline inflation directly and would diminish the threat of higher energy prices becoming more deeply embedded in the inflation process by raising inflation expectations. And, to date, inflation expectations have been well anchored. As I have already mentioned, it would not be surprising to see some pickup in hourly compensation, but such an acceleration may not add to price pressures. In today\\'s competitive environment, and with profits generally robust, some of the cost increases might well be absorbed in margins. Moreover, further productivity gains should act to damp the effects on overall unit costs.Like all forecasts, this expectation of stable inflation is only the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes. For example, a further spurt in energy and commodity prices could be passed through into core inflation to a greater extent than seems to have been occurring recently; the threat of that outcome probably is especially great when the economy is already operating at a high level. If the economy does not moderate somewhat, pressures on resources will increase, further raising the odds of higher inflation. And as I discussed earlier, historical patterns suggest that resource utilization is already in a zone that at times has been associated with the emergence of inflation pressures. But the risks are not all one-sided. Price and compensation inflation have, in fact, remained moderate at high levels of resource utilization, despite rapid increases in energy and commodity prices, suggesting that some forces not yet fully identified may be helping to keep them contained. Those forces might include robust underlying productivity growth here at home or competition from abroad. It is also possible that the economy could cool more than expected if housing markets weaken quite substantially, consumption is cut back significantly, and as a consequence businesses pare capital spending plans.My job as a policymaker is to work with my colleagues to identify the path of short-term interest rates that has the best chance of realizing that favorable central-tendency forecast of solid growth and continued low inflation. I do not know how much policy firming will be needed to accomplish this objective.My forecast is that the economy is in transition to a sustainable pace of growth, in which case policy likely will be in transition as well. At this juncture, given the apparent strength in demand and the narrowing margin of unused resources, I am focused on making sure that inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored. A tendency for inflation to move higher would put economic stability and the long-term performance of the economy at risk. Accordingly, for me, the critical indicators in the time ahead will be the ones that signal whether growth is indeed likely to proceed at a sustainable pace and whether inflation remains on a favorable track. This is a judgment my colleagues and I will need to make meeting by meeting as the incoming information--both the data and, critically, the timely feel for developments that we get from the Reserve Banks\\' contacts in the community--help us assess the paths for the economy and price pressures.Footnotes Recent trends in the U.S. economy have been, on the whole, quite favorable. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 3-1/4 percent during 2005, on the heels of two years during which it rose at an annual rate of almost 4 percent. By the end of last year, businesses had added another 2 million jobs to their payrolls, and the unemployment rate had dropped to its lowest level in five years. Although top-line consumer price inflation was boosted by the run-up in energy prices, core consumer price inflation remained relatively steady, at about 2 percent for the year.One of the significant challenges for a policymaker is to be able to discern the underlying trends in real activity and inflation in the midst of the inevitable noise and shocks that come along. The recent period has presented a number of those types of unanticipated events: Most notably, the devastating hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast last fall destroyed residential and business capital and tragically uprooted the lives of many people. The resulting disruptions to economic activity, particularly in the energy and petrochemical sectors, held down the rise in real GDP in the fourth quarter. The restarting and rebuilding that began late last year should be providing a boost to activity this year, but the size of that effect and the extent to which it will be distributed in coming quarters remain uncertain. Another special factor at work early this year was the atypically warm weather that very likely advanced homebuilding and perhaps other spending that might otherwise have stretched into the spring. As a result, most forecasters believe that the incoming information has been adding up to a sizable, but quite likely temporary, acceleration in real GDP in the first quarter after the small increase in the final quarter of 2005.Another, more persistent economic challenge in recent years has been the climb in world oil prices. As a result, last year marked a third consecutive year of rapidly rising--and sometimes volatile--domestic energy costs. To be sure, higher energy prices cut into households\\' purchasing power and the profits of non-energy firms. While recognizing the difficulty of identifying the reactions of consumers and businesses to higher energy prices, Chairman Bernanke has recently noted that the surge in energy prices since late 2003 probably reduced the growth of real GDP between 1/2 percent and 1 percent per year. One important change in the economic landscape that has limited the current effect of an energy shock compared with the effects in our earlier experience is that energy costs today are not nearly as important as they were during the 1970s, when the energy intensity of U.S. production was significantly higher.After taking into consideration the unusual factors that have been influencing the pattern of economic activity of late, most forecasters are projecting that, after a sizable increase in the first quarter, production and spending will return to a moderate and sustainable pace over the remainder of the year. Several fundamental factors support that view. First, although longer-term yields have begun to move up recently, they remain low by historical standards, and financial conditions remain favorable. Second, business balance sheets are strong, and corporate earnings have been robust. Third, household credit quality has shown few signs of stress. Finally, households\\' real income has been receiving a boost from the recent strong gains in employment, and the ongoing increases in house prices and gains in the stock market have kept the ratio of wealth to income at a high level.All told, prospects for ongoing gains in consumer spending and business investment appear good, and the recent indicators are positive. This morning\\'s report on retail sales, together with the information on motor vehicle sales released last week, points to a solid rise in real consumer spending in March and a very strong reading for the first quarter as a whole. The outlook for moderate increases in personal consumption expenditures in the near term is consistent with the latest readings on consumer sentiment. In addition, the continued low level of new claims for unemployment insurance bodes well for further net gains in employment and, thus, income. A survey of businesses\\' capital spending plans conducted by the National Association of Business Economists at the end of last year pointed to another solid year of spending on plant and equipment. And, through February, backlogs of orders for nondefense capital goods were still moving up.Another important factor in the outlook for the United States is the likelihood of a continued solid expansion in economic activity abroad. Notably, the Japanese economy has strengthened, and economic activity in emerging Asian economies has continued to rise at a brisk pace, while the outlook in Canada calls for sustained moderate growth.Domestic economic activity should also continue to receive a boost in coming quarters from reconstruction in the Gulf region. In part, the reconstruction represents some temporary federal fiscal stimulus from the hurricane relief that the Congress has provided. However, despite the additional support to construction from hurricane-related repair and rebuilding, residential construction overall appears likely to cool a bit this year. The most recent indicators suggest that demand and home-price inflation have begun to moderate.With respect to inflation, although forecasting energy prices is risky, I should note that the futures market suggests that crude oil prices will move up a bit further in coming months before flattening out at $70 per barrel. If so, the drag on real income and spending from rising energy costs should diminish over time, as should the risk of additional energy cost pressure on underlying, or \"core,\" inflation.The general contour of economic activity that most forecasters are expecting, in which they see little change in resource utilization over the year, should be consistent with relatively stable core inflation. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate is now at a five-year low of 4-3/4 percent. More important, it and other indicators of resource utilization--such as the industrial capacity utilization rate--are now at levels at which, in the past, little or no economic slack remained. At this point, we have seen few signs of upward pressure on labor compensation or core inflation. Although we have experienced run-ups in prices of commodities, such as building supplies, that are more sensitive to changes in supply and demand conditions and in prices of energy-intensive commodities and services, the pass-through to core inflation appears to have been limited. Important in that regard is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have been well anchored, as is apparent in the stability of the five-to-ten-year inflation expectations of households in the Michigan SRC survey and in the reading implicit in Treasury-inflation-protected securities.The observations I\\'ve just shared illustrate the evolving economic forces that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider as it makes monetary policy decisions over the remainder of the year. The FOMC has raised the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at each of the past fifteen meetings over roughly two years. During much of that time, we described our actions as \"removing accommodation\" at a \"measured pace.\" At our March meeting, we indicated that some additional tightening may be necessary to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. Thus, the future path for the target federal funds rate will depend importantly on how incoming information on economic activity and inflation affect our assessment of these risks. I am very pleased to open this conference on Modern Financial Institutions, Financial Markets and Systemic Risk. Let me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for hosting this conference and for organizing, along with the International Association of Financial Engineers, an impressive program that is filled with high-quality papers on topics of keen interest to central bankers. Before proceeding, I must indicate that the views I am about to express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve more generally.Few subjects are more important for central bankers than the efficiency and stability of our financial system. The term \"financial instability\" is often poorly defined. Some argue that financial instability occurs when imperfections or externalities in the financial system are substantial enough to create significant risks for real aggregate economic performance. Others argue that financial stability is potentially absent, or that financial instability is on the horizon, when they perceive that some important set of financial asset prices seem to have diverged sharply from fundamentals. Finally, many observers have used the term \"financial instability\" to describe their perception that market functioning seems to have been significantly distorted or impaired. Regardless of the definitions used for financial instability, they lead us to a strong interest in ensuring that our financial infrastructure is robust and that our supervisory operations are sound and up-to-date.Ironically, our interest in financial stability seem to have increased in recent years even as real (that is, inflation-adjusted) variability in economic aggregates seems to have decreased. Since 1985, the volatility of real growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has been only about half of what it was during the preceding twenty-five years. In addition, as shown in a number of papers, the volatility of many components of GDP and of other measures of aggregate economic activity also declined sharply between these periods.The source of the moderation in the real economy is unclear. Changes in data construction do not seem to be responsible. Fiscal policy has not become appreciably more countercyclical, and the shift of the economy toward producing more services appears to have played only a small role. The leading explanations of the moderation are that (1) economic shocks have been milder; (2) inventory management has improved; (3) financial innovations such as improved risk assessment and risk-based pricing have made credit more widely available, even during economic downturns; and (4) monetary policy has been better.The first explanation--milder economic shocks--has seemed less persuasive following the events of the late 1990s and early 2000s. From the Asian financial crisis to the September 11 attacks to the corporate governance scandals to the surge in oil prices, powerful economic shocks have marked the past few years. Yet, the economy has performed rather well, on balance, over this period.As for the second explanation--better inventory management--changes in inventory dynamics have indeed contributed significantly to the reduced volatility of GDP growth. Those changes are consistent with anecdotal evidence and case studies about the use of information technology and better inventory management practices to catch incipient inventory overhangs before they become a problem.Let me focus for a moment on the fourth explanation, that monetary policy has been better. I think it has indeed been better. We are better at understanding how the economy operates (and therefore, at evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy) and we are more determined to pursue the goal of price stability. But secondarily, I think the greater dominance of market-based finance, combined with a greater transparency by the Federal Reserve, has made both the mechanism of monetary policy and the intentions of the central bank more understandable to market participants.The mechanism of monetary policy is clearer with greater market-based finance relative to bank-dominated finance because the direct effects of policy on corporate and household balance sheets are more easily observed by both policymakers and market participants. In contrast, bank-dominated finance involves more complicated interactions between depositor behavior, loan underwriting standards, and interest rates.The greater transparency of central banks also seems to have led to improved economic performance. Market expectations are more likely to remain anchored in the face of various shocks when investors can see more clearly that central bankers are committed to long-run objectives such as price stability and sustainable economic growth. This commitment feeds into the planning and execution of investments by firms and households, which are more likely to undertake such investments given greater certainty about the commitment of the central bank. Moreover, with this greater certainty, prices and pricing decisions more clearly communicate the desires of households and firms.Thus, the moderation in aggregate economic volatility seems somewhat understandable. But why, then, the seemingly greater concern these days about financial market instability? This anxiety appears to be driven by three factors: First, some asset prices, such as housing prices, seem to be high by historical standards. Given the substantial decline of stock prices beginning in 2000, many observers worry that greater boom or bust cycles in some asset prices could be the \"flip-side\" of the moderation of real economic volatility during recent decades.Asset prices are the key channel through which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy. Moreover, because asset prices embody the expectations of forward-looking investors, they might contain information of value for the policy-setting process. But from the Federal Reserve\\'s perspective, asset prices must ultimately be seen through the lens of long-term growth and price stability. If inflation seems contained and the prospects for economic growth are good, then it\\'s unclear why the policymaker should set aside these direct signals in preference for signals from asset prices that may or may not be out of line with their historical relationships to fundamentals--the very fundamentals, I should add, that we look at directly in judging the health of the economy. Indeed, even in retrospect, our knowledge of what drove the price-earnings ratios for U.S. equities so high in the late 1990s and our ability to estimate what a more \"appropriate\" level for the price-earnings ratio might have been are very incomplete and, frankly, probably will not improve substantially.Additionally, in the current conjuncture, some have expressed a concern that an unwinding of global imbalances, should it occur, might be disorderly and associated with financial instability. Others question whether the simultaneous removal of monetary accommodation by central banks in several major economies could possibly trigger a period of financial instability emanating from the inevitable rebalancing of portfolios. Should events such as these occur, central bank communication and understanding market participants\\' reactions will certainly be important considerations for maintaining financial stability.A third source of anxiety concerning financial market instability arises because some of the more recent crises have been financial in nature. Although their effects on the real economy in the United States have been relatively limited, the economies of other nations have been significantly affected, and there is concern that a financial crisis might, at some point, have more severe consequences for the real economy in the United States. When we review these recent cases of financial market turmoil, it appears that each is a unique event. But some common lessons can be learned, and I will outline them after I briefly review two of these crises that have been important in the United States during the past decade.The market turmoil in the fall of 1998 was touched off by the Russian debt default in August and then exacerbated by the well-publicized travails of Long-Term Capital Management. During this time, nearly all financial indicators portrayed a dour picture of economic prospects--risk spreads widened sharply, stock prices fell, and banks reported tightening the terms and lending standards on business loans. In addition, market reports indicated that the capital markets were seizing up as dealers and other marketmakers recoiled from risk taking. In response, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points in three equal steps and maintained the lower rate through June of the subsequent year. This response mainly reflected FOMC concerns that these financial instabilities had either signaled or created significant downside risks to the economic outlook, particularly for business investment. The FOMC\\'s significant aversion to the possible negative outcomes associated with these risks was part of a risk-management perspective--that is, that the economic recovery from a financial shock could be more difficult to manage than the financial shock itself.As for events after 1998, it is more difficult to identify a \"pure\" financial crisis. The devastating terrorist attacks in 2001 caused tragic loss of life and major damage to the physical infrastructure of a number of key firms central to trading and market-making activities. Although there were many important differences, this crisis mimicked a financial meltdown in the sense that important financial markets could not operate because of the cessation of activities by some firms.The Federal Reserve responded in a manner that was appropriate to the nature of the crisis. We issued a statement that we were up and running and ready, if needed, to extend loans from the discount window. Depository institutions took up the offer; their borrowing surged to more than $45 billion but dropped quickly after a few days. We also worked jointly with foreign central banks to provide funds to promote the smoother operation of foreign exchange transactions and established swap lines that channeled funds to institutions that needed dollars. In addition, the Federal Reserve took a variety of other actions, including waiving daylight overdraft fees, extending the operating hours for Fedwire, and easing the limits on securities lending to reduce the pressure on firms requiring securities that were made scarce because of settlement difficulties. All these measures were taken quickly, maintained temporarily, and wound down in an orderly manner as the need for them receded.After the initial rush of activity, we focused on the nonfinancial economy. Evidence of a weakening economy had already emerged before the terrorist attacks; the decline in stock prices, the widening of risk spreads, and the impairment of market functioning created by the attacks caused many policymakers to worry that this weakening would accelerate. Again reflecting the risk-management perspective I described earlier, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points before the reopening of the markets on Monday, September 17, 2001. In explaining its action, the FOMC pointed to a less sanguine economic outlook and to significant downside risks associated with that outlook.Besides the crisis of 1998 and the September 11 terrorist attacks, other episodes of financial turmoil were important, but these episodes did not raise the same level of concern that the negative shock might be transmitted to the nonfinancial economy in a rapid and disorderly fashion. For example, the significant decline of stock prices starting in 2000 was not accompanied by a major market malfunctioning, and the resulting loss of equity wealth did not seem likely to have negative ramifications for the real economy that were so immediate and severe as to be considered a crisis. Similarly, the major accounting and corporate scandals of 2002 led to a significant widening of risk premiums and much anxiety about the veracity of many corporations\\' financial statements. But for the most part, the markets again functioned smoothly and risks seemed to be priced normally. Finally, the more pronounced interest rate volatility during the summer of 2003, which appears to have been significantly amplified by mortgage hedging, created some short-lived market difficulties. But again, this volatility seemed unlikely to have significant effects on the real economy.Despite the rarity of internally generated financial crisis, some argue that ongoing trends in the United States should be examined closely for their potential effects on financial stability. Four trends are often mentioned.The first is increased concentration in the financial services industry. In particular, consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of firms doing a larger share of the bank lending throughout the world. For example, the origination and servicing of consumer loans have become more concentrated. For the most part, these rising levels of concentration appear to be motivated by cost savings that are often attributed to economies of scale, or by expectations of greater revenue stability derived from either greater diversification of products or greater geographic diversification. While the risks to financial stability that arise from the creation of a small number of large and complex firms are obvious, there may be benefits as well. Greater concentration in financial services has the potential to have some positive impact on financial stability because lower costs can allow firms to build the capital reserves that help insulate them from shocks, and greater diversification can reduce firm risk. Moreover, the market and financial supervisors are requiring the adoption of more sophisticated and comprehensive techniques for the management of risks associated with larger and more complex firms. However, the benefits of lower costs, greater diversification, and better risk management at large, complex firms depend on many particulars, including robust infrastructure and a reduction in the opaqueness that results from increased firm complexity. In this regard, infrastructure is one area in which the increase in concentration has received attention. The creation of NewBank, which I describe later, is a recent private-sector response to the concentration of clearing and settlement activities in the market for government securities.The second trend is that the pricing and management of credit continues to become more market oriented. This development should increase financial stability, because market pricing and the management of credit risk via marketable securities would be expected to promote a more robust system for risk management. In this scenario, a broad-based and diversified group of rational market participants would determine the success or failure of financial products through an evolutionary process, allowing the available set of financial assets to gradually become more useful and comprehensive. However, some hold to a more pessimistic scenario that envisions smaller groups of market participants, with short time horizons and an excessive interest in mark-to-market profitability, who create more volatility because of their high sensitivity to the latest rumors and news. I tend to adopt the more optimistic view, but in any case the central bank will need to maintain its focus on markets as more credit is intermediated through them.The third trend is similar to the second. The ongoing increase in the scope and availability of financial instruments is probably providing many firms and households with improved methods of risk diversification and hedging and with greater access to credit. As I noted earlier, such financial innovations have likely been partly responsible for the lowered variability in many real economic aggregates over the past two decades. That said, the increasing complexity of these instruments raises a host of policy questions regarding, to name just a few items, financial education for households, and, for financial institutions, operational procedures, valuation practices, accounting treatments, disclosure policies, and capital provisions. Moreover, these financial innovations often rely on the ready availability of market liquidity, an assumption that likely will not hold during a financial crisis. Therefore, one hopes that all market participants who are involved in these complex instruments have liquidity plans in place.The final trend is the ongoing and increasing globalization of markets. Make no mistake; I think such a trend is to be welcomed because it brings about the usual gains from trade. But we must be mindful that borrowers are raising funds in multiple financial centers in multiple currencies across diverse legal and political systems; that investors are taking on greater international exposure; and that arbitrageurs are establishing leveraged positions across currencies and international markets. These actions increase cross-border interdependence and thus in some circumstances might propagate financial problems more quickly and widely.Given these trends, what roles should a central bank play with regard to financial stability? I would suggest three. First and foremost, the central bank\\'s role is to maintain a focus on the possible effects of financial instability for its two core objectives, namely price stability and long-run real growth. Any actions to promote financial stability need to be seen through this lens. We must always ask: Do our potential actions credibly mitigate a risk of inflation or a threat to the real economy? Such a standard helps reduce the danger that we might pursue financial stability to the point of changing the behavior of market participants in counterproductive ways, such as increasing moral hazard, which would, in turn, create problems for the real economy. This objective also suggests that the central bank needs to continually monitor financial developments, including those regarding financial accounting and reporting standards, to be able to appropriately assess the effect of these developments on the real economy.Secondly, I would argue that the examples of the recent past, combined with our understanding of how markets function, suggest that much of the central bank\\'s work lies in bank supervision, including promoting better risk management and the avoidance of operational risks on the part of other financial institutions, and emphasizing the importance of backup and contingency arrangements. That is, the central bank can assist in getting market participants to consider and focus on the management of risk in general and of the risk of low probability, but high cost, outcomes in particular.Along these lines, we have encouraged banks to adopt the most modern risk-management techniques, and we have encouraged all financial institutions to ensure the robustness of their systems. We have also strived to bring our capital regulations up-to-date and make them more risk sensitive through the Basel II process and the effort to revise Basel I; both of these efforts are intended to modernize capital regimes as part of our ongoing effort to improve safety and soundness and, ultimately, financial stability. And following our own advice, the Federal Reserve has implemented additional layers of backup and contingency arrangements for our key payment system operations.Most recently, the Federal Reserve Board endorsed the creation of a dormant bank, referred to as NewBank, which would be available for activation to clear and settle U.S. government securities. Such activation would occur if a credit or legal problem caused the market to lose confidence in an existing clearing bank and no well-qualified bank stepped forward to purchase that bank\\'s clearing business. Similarly, the Federal Reserve System, operating through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has met with major dealers to improve the practices of the credit derivatives industry in various ways, including implementing procedures to improve the settlement process for credit default swaps, establishing targets for the reduction of confirmation backlogs, and insisting that dealers obtain the consent of the original counterparty before accepting an assignment of a contract.The final role I would suggest for a central bank is to research the implications of longer-term financial trends for the economy more generally. As I mentioned above, the consolidation of financial services, increasing market intermediation of credit, the greater complexity of financial instruments, and increasing globalization of financial institutions and markets all might raise concerns about our financial system. Although my assessment, and that of many other observers, is that these forces and developments support financial stability, they merit ongoing study.One lesson that stands out from our experience gained during the past decade is that only looking backward is not useful. Prudent central bankers must be forward-looking, searching for developments that might become significant problems under some circumstances. What would be useful from a risk-management perspective is more information along the lines of what we have for inflation--market instruments that allow us to measure, to some extent, market participants\\' expectations. The absence of such direct measures of financial stability, however, suggests that we should continue to present our views of potential financial risks and their associated propagation mechanisms, both to other public-sector colleagues and to private-sector analysts and observers. Participation in official organizations such as the President\\'s Working Group, the Financial Stability Forum, and the Committee on the Global Financial System, which are little known to the general public but are well regarded by the official community, offers the Federal Reserve such engagement. Moreover, we should develop theoretical and empirical models to help us understand potential risks. That is why conferences such as this one, which bring together researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to discuss issues related to financial stability, are so important.Footnotes I would like to thank Greenlining for the opportunity to participate in today\\'s conference. In my time at the Federal Reserve, I have had a number of opportunities to meet with community economic development leaders to discuss issues of mutual concern and learn about the valuable role that community development organizations play in economically distressed areas across the country. I have been particularly impressed, and heartened, by the increasingly high degree of professionalism in the field. In this area, as in social policy generally, good intentions are not enough. Successful community development requires knowledge--knowledge about the particular community in question and about what has worked in similar communities in the past--and community development organizations are working assiduously and with sophisticated tools to help develop that knowledge.Of course, knowledge bearing on community economic development has both qualitative and quantitative aspects, and it can be gained through diverse channels, from talking to people in a neighborhood to performing a regression analysis. Today, I will focus on the progress that is being made on the quantitative side--in particular, the remarkable strides that have been made in developing and analyzing social and economic data at the community level. The information that can be extracted from detailed data profiles of individual communities supports economic development in several distinct ways. First, by making companies, entrepreneurs, and investors aware of new opportunities and by promoting competition in underserved areas, such information helps put market forces in the service of community development. Second, both government policymakers and community development organizations need the reality check that only hard data can provide. To know whether our policies and programs are delivering the desired results, we need to be able to measure inputs and outcomes, program by program and community by community. Better information increases accountability and promotes good governance in both the public and the nonprofit sectors. Third, the increased availability of community-level data facilitates independent research, which is vital to informing the public policy debate and to developing further community development efforts, both public and private.Historically, government agencies have been the source of the most-comprehensive social and economic data bearing on community development. An important example is the data collected by the Federal Reserve under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The HMDA data set provides extensive information on home mortgage applications to virtually all U.S. lenders, including approval rates, the socioeconomic characteristics of applicants, and most recently, mortgage pricing information. As all good social scientists know, the data never \"speak for themselves,\" and the HMDA information, like any data set, must be interpreted with care and insight. Still, for nearly three decades, the HMDA data have provided valuable information about mortgage lending patterns, contributed to significant changes in mortgage credit practices, informed regulatory policies, and supported fair-lending enforcement.Although government agencies continue to be an important source of data on community development, data collection and data analysis in this area is increasingly becoming the province of the private and nonprofit sectors, notably including community development organizations themselves. In recent years, we have seen a series of data-collection initiatives outside the public sector, with objectives that include the improvement of development strategies, the identification of new opportunities, the quantification of risk, and the exertion of influence on the direction of public policy. Many of these efforts have already had significant payoffs.In the rest of my remarks, I will discuss some specific ways data and quantitative measurement have been used in community development. To be clear, I do not believe that all aspects of economic development can or should be quantified; and, as I have already noted, the data never speak for themselves but must be interpreted with care. Still, improving the measurement of inputs and outcomes is critical to better development policy. In this regard, it is interesting to observe that we have seen some convergence between best practices in community economic development and in economic development policy at the international level. I will conclude by noting a few of those parallels and their implications.Work to improve the measurement of market potential in inner-city communities is continuing. In one such project, Social Compact and the Brookings Institution\\'s Urban Markets Initiative group are collaborating in reviewing methods for measuring the size and composition of economies in urban areas around the world. The objectives of the review are to develop new tools for measuring economic activity at the local level and to identify areas for future research.Informing Investors in Community DevelopmentThe growth and maturation of community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide another impetus for data development and analysis at the community level. CDFIs are private-sector financial intermediaries with community development as their primary mission. Like banks and other more-conventional financial intermediaries, CDFIs are in the business of attracting funds and putting those funds to work in productive ways. Also like conventional intermediaries, CDFIs depend heavily on the production of accurate information both to guide investment decisions and to provide a basis for attracting new funding. It is difficult to overstate the importance of adequate and accurate information for attracting capital. Managers of pools of capital have many choices, and they tend to be extremely wary when they cannot fully assess the level of risk presented.With an appreciation for the need for such information, managers and others with an interest in the CDFI industry have invested substantial effort in designing tools for data collection and analysis that focus on measuring the financial performance--the risks and returns--of CDFI portfolios. An important motivation for these efforts is the need to diversify funding sources for community development, which has relied heretofore largely on grants from government and foundations. To attract more return-oriented investors, including both conventional investors and those with social as well as financial goals, CDFIs must demonstrate financial viability as well as the ability to fulfill the broader development mission.More generally, the movement toward quantifying the performance, risk, and community impact of CDFIs is essential to the growth and sustainability of the field, in my view. By demonstrating both financial viability and social impact through hard data, CDFIs are better positioned to obtain the funding necessary to maintain their operations and to respond to emerging needs and opportunities. Indeed, progress has been made in recent years in the rating and securitization of community development portfolios, a development that should provide CDFIs with increased access to the capital markets and to new sources of liquidity. If the new data and evaluation methods of CDFI performance bear scrutiny, investors will gain confidence in using this information for matching their investment choices with their priorities and risk tolerances. In the community development field, to be sure, financial returns and social returns are not necessarily the same, which is why measurement should include both financial and social indicators. Potential investors, including public-sector and foundation sources of funds, will naturally differ on the weights they put on financial and social returns. To attract the widest range of funding, both types of information should be provided.Evaluating Policy and Practice Quantitative information plays yet another important role: increasing the effectiveness of policies and programs. The systematic collection and analysis of data on program inputs and outputs is an increasingly important part of learning about what works. For policymakers, data on program results help guide policy development and improve the allocation of scarce public funds. For community development organizations, participation in broad-based data-gathering serves at least two goals. First, in the long run, their analyses of the activities and the associated outcomes in diverse communities will help them achieve the greatest impact for resources expended. Second, such analyses help community development organizations demonstrate their effectiveness to public and private funders.Parallels to International Economic DevelopmentThe usefulness of microeconomic data in community development raises an interesting parallel to recent analyses of international economic development. Although the U.S. context is obviously different in important respects from that of developing countries, domestic community organizations and providers of international aid both face the challenge of fostering economic development in low-income areas. In the United States, our experience in community development over the past thirty years has resulted in an evolution from a centralized, federal-government-driven approach to a heavy reliance on the involvement of community-based organizations and agencies for project development and implementation. In light of this experience, it is quite interesting that some new thinking on international development has rejected the traditional approach to aid, with its emphasis on large-scale projects and top-down planning, in favor of micro-level, bottom-up approaches that use local information and systematic analyses of inputs and outcomes.The themes emphasized by Easterly and other analysts of international aid programs are useful, I think, in the context of domestic community development. Although national initiatives have their place, often the most effective programs take place at the level of the individual community, using local information and local participation. Accountability and feedback, facilitated by data development and quantitative analysis as well as by more-qualitative information, are critical for success. Goals should be modest at first; but knowledge is cumulative, and sometimes good results can be replicated at larger scales. Research, both quantitative and qualitative, furthers learning. None of this is easy, particularly since the data have a way of challenging our views about what works and what doesn\\'t. But a great deal is at stake both internationally and domestically and serious empirical analysis has no substitute. The development of more and better data on economically distressed communities, together with sophisticated tools for analyzing those data, is essential for continued progress in community economic development.Footnotes The members of any group calling itself the Forecasters Club don\\'t need an elaborate justification for my focus today on business fixed investment. The outlook for business investment is always a key element in any economic forecast. It can be a highly volatile component of aggregate demand, with variations in investment often accounting for a good share of the fluctuations in economic activity. That lesson was demonstrated again in the past decade when strength in business investment contributed to the vigorous expansion of the second half of the 1990s, and then a marked and prolonged weakening in capital spending contributed to recession and sluggish growth in 2001 and 2002. Business investment also has important implications for the supply side of the economy through its influence on the rate of increase in labor productivity and thus the economy\\'s sustainable level of potential output.Business fixed investment has risen at a robust annual rate of nearly 9 percent on average over the past two years, and the real level of investment at the end of last year, $1.3 trillion, was nearly 6 percent higher than the peak reached five years earlier. However, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded nearly 14 percent over the same period. To be sure, the investment peak in 2000 was unusually high; still, the nominal share of business fixed investment in GDP, at 10-3/4 percent at the end of 2005, was well below its forty-year average.Of course, comparisons of these simple ratios and growth rates do not account for other influences on investment in the macroeconomic environment, such as interest rates, the prices of capital goods, or the rate of increase in final spending. However, a more rigorous exercise using a standard model favored by many forecasters yields a similar conclusion. Using lagged net investment, changes in business output, and changes in the user cost of capital to predict the level of current net investment, we find that the model did not forecast the plunge in investment in 2001. And, despite its ability to predict recent growth rates reasonably well, a dynamic simulation of such a model starting in 2000 indicates that the current level of investment is still considerably lower than expected. To be sure, we would not have expected investment to snap back right away, judging from experience. Still, investment over the past few years is showing no signs of returning to the path that we would have expected from historical relationships through 1999.Business financial statements also reflect evidence of restrained business spending behavior. Normally, businesses are heavy net users of savings generated by the rest of the economy. The financing gap--the level of capital spending over the level of internal funds--is a measure of that reliance. But it was close to zero in 2002 and 2003 and remained unusually low last year (after adjustment for tax-induced flows of repatriated foreign earnings), which suggests that businesses didn\\'t see enough profitable investment projects to warrant tapping the markets for external financing, even at low long-term interest rates. To be sure, profit margins and cash flow have been high, but that would also seem to be an environment that should encourage expansion. In fact, businesses appear to be using some of their very large holdings of cash for other purposes. Corporations have increased their share repurchases, which hit a record level last year. They have also increased share retirements through cash-financed mergers and acquisitions, which have been boosted by a surge in buyouts. Evidently, corporate managers view prospective returns from these uses of cash flow as comparing favorably with those from new capital spending projects.The low level of investment has not been unique to the United States. Gross investment in other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was sluggish in the early years of this recovery, and the nominal share of nonresidential fixed investment in GDP in these countries is still barely higher than its twenty-five-year trough in 2003. This pattern persists despite a low cost of capital and ample cash flows in many countries as well as business sentiment that improved markedly last year. Although real investment in Japan has moved up fairly steadily for nearly three years, capital spending was weak for nearly a decade as profits were channeled to clean up balance sheets rather than expand productive capacity. Euro-area investment has also languished, in part because of relatively slow growth prospects. In both Japan and the euro area, investment likely also is being curtailed to some extent because of a demographic shift toward a more elderly population: As the share of the population that is of working age declines, the rise in the capital stock needed to equip the labor force decreases.Investment in the East Asian countries is still lower than before the crises of the late 1990s, although investment rates in the region are generally higher than those in advanced economies. Also, lower rates of investment in some of these countries may reflect some shifting of production to China (where investment rates have been quite high in recent years).Ratios and equations are at best only rough guides to the investment that we might expect on the basis of past behavior in similar circumstances. Still, looking across a variety of indicators and a variety of countries, it does appear that the level of investment is unusually low for this stage of the business cycle. A more difficult task is determining why. As we shall see, there are a number of possible explanations, but no single one seems to hold the entire answer.An explanation that has received a great deal of attention is that a capital overhang, usually thought of as concentrated in high-tech equipment, developed in the late 1990s and subsequently has been dragging down investment spending. In the late 1990s, firms invested in high-tech goods at a very rapid pace, spurred at first by plunging prices and robust business output growth and eventually by an apparently overly optimistic view about the returns on those investments. Subsequently, high-tech investment dropped at a double-digit rate in 2001 and fell further in 2002. This sharp decline, combined with the high depreciation rates on these types of goods, severely curtailed growth of the capital stock, and any overhang seems likely to have been eliminated relatively quickly. However, desired or optimal capital stocks are notoriously difficult to specify and measure, and hence so are overhangs, even several years after the episode. Consequently, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the excess capital built up during the late 1990s is restraining investment to some extent today.Another possibility is that business investment has been held down in recent years because relative prices of capital goods are no longer falling at the same pace at which they declined in the late 1990s. At least some of the deceleration may reflect a slowing pace of technological improvement--that is, less-rapid downward shifts in the supply curve of capital goods. However, to the extent that these price changes are well measured and our econometric models are well specified, the implications of slower price declines should already be captured by our models. In addition, the effects of less rapidly falling prices on the growth rate of the user cost of capital appears to have been substantially offset over much of this period by declines in real interest rates.Another explanation that received attention in the early years of this decade is that businesses were unusually cautious after the most recent recession in expanding their productive capacity. Both hiring and capital investment lagged the usual recovery pace. One possible source of this caution was said to be questions about the strength and sustainability of the recovery, accentuated by concerns about terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainties. Many periods of recovery have been accompanied by concerns about economic growth and political turmoil. But surveys suggest that managers did experience a prolonged sense of gloom, with measures of sentiment dropping to low levels and staying that way for a year or two beyond the business cycle trough. However, the economy has been expanding at an above-trend pace for about two years now, and the durability of the recovery should no longer be an issue. Indeed, most surveys of business confidence and capital spending plans have reached, and in some cases exceeded, the levels of the late 1990s.Still another possibility is that conditions created by corporate governance scandals and the regulatory response to those events led firms to hold back on capital spending. The scandals and the market\\'s reaction were said to have contributed to a more conservative attitude toward risk taking. Moreover, complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may have affected capital spending as firms scrambled to meet the 2004 and 2005 deadlines. Clearly, compliance costs have been substantial, perhaps diverting funds and attention away from capital spending plans. However, capital spending to update information systems to address the enhanced auditing needs may be offsetting at least a portion of any damping effect the legislation may have had. In any event, the market effects of corporate governance scandals appear to have faded some time ago. And, at larger companies, where systems have been adapted to the new requirements, compliance now should be more routine, freeing time and attention to concentrate on business strategy and expansion. If these types of influences have had any restraining effects, they should be receding.Changing replacement cycles are another potential downward influence on the pace of investment. Before 2000, many firms invested in new technologies to replace those not compatible with the century date change. This effort tended to speed up replacement cycles (and thus depreciation), boosting gross investment at that time. The resulting bunching of purchases may have contributed to the drop-off in investment in 2001 as firms with relatively new, efficient capital goods saw less reason to upgrade. Also, during 2001 and 2002, anecdotal reports suggested that many firms saw no need to upgrade equipment because no compelling new technology or application had been released, which would have tended to lengthen the replacement cycle. If replacement cycles since then have remained longer than in previous decades, firms would respond with a lower level of gross investment. And, anecdotes and surveys suggest that replacement cycles have in fact lengthened in this century compared with the late 1990s. But the implied drop in the rate of depreciation is much too small to explain the low-investment puzzle.Some have posited that low investment in the United States reflects firms\\' decisions to meet expanding demand by investing overseas rather than at home. Economic theory suggests that in countries where labor is cheap and abundant, all else equal, we would expect the marginal product of capital to be relatively high, making these economies attractive places in which to invest. Thus, countries such as China ought to be seeing an influx of direct investment. However, the dollar value of U.S. direct investment into China averaged about $2 billion per year in the first five years of this decade, much less than 1 percent of domestic investment spending and not enough to be a major influence on investment spending trends. Looking at flows to all developing economies, the share of outward direct investment going to these destinations has been about flat over the past decade. Foreign direct investment, as a whole, has been rising relative to domestic investment, but gradually over several decades--a trend that was not picked up in recent years.Clearly, none of these explanations is the sole cause of the relatively restrained level of investment. Most likely, some combination of these factors along with others we have not identified accounted for the sharp decline in investment in 2001 and 2002 and has contributed to keeping investment spending rising along a lower track subsequently, both domestically and abroad. However, as I noted, several of those factors are of questionable quantitative import, and others no longer seem to provide a rationale for the failure of investment spending to rebound more vigorously. Yet, most indicators in hand do not point to a surge in business fixed investment that will restore the trend derived from earlier relationships.Instead, the latest reads on business spending and intentions point to continued solid growth in capital spending, supported by favorable fundamentals of steady increases in final demand and a relatively damped cost of capital. Over the past three quarters, both orders and shipments of capital equipment (excluding the volatile aircraft category) have continued to move up at roughly the steady pace seen since 2003. Moreover, orders remained above shipments in the first quarter of this year, leading to another increase in the backlog of orders. In addition, surveys indicate that businesses\\' capital spending plans and their outlook for sales remain, on balance, in the elevated range that they have occupied for several quarters. A slowing in the growth of consumption and residential investment associated with a cooling in the housing market will exert some restraint on capital investment, but business sales should receive some support from improved markets for our exports.Moreover, business spending on structures finally seems to be picking up momentum. The construction data that we have in hand for the first two months of the year suggest a bounceback from the anemic growth in spending on nonresidential buildings that has prevailed over the past few years. This pickup should persist, responding to the recent declines in office and industrial vacancy rates. And expenditures on drilling and mining structures are likely to remain strong, given the current market expectations for elevated energy prices. Spending on structures should also get a boost this year from rebuilding in the areas hard hit by last year\\'s hurricanes.The outlook for solid increases in investment spending has both upside and downside risks associated with it. On the downside, the cooling off that we are currently observing in housing markets could become more severe, and both residential construction and consumer spending could take a larger hit than expected. A substantial slowing in these two categories of final demand would likely induce some businesses to curtail or delay investment projects. On the upside, we cannot say exactly why the level of investment has remained low for the past few years, so we certainly cannot rule out a return to previous higher trends. In that regard, we do seem to be seeing a strengthening in global demand, which could signal a more pervasive change in attitudes and expectations.Because capital spending influences not only aggregate demand today but also influences aggregate supply and productivity over the medium term, it is a key element of any forecast. The focus in current commentary is mostly on the outlook for housing and consumption, but I suspect that business fixed investment will again play a central role in shaping the path of the economy. The experience of the past several years does not seem to have greatly clarified the reasons for the extent of the fall in investment in 2001 and 2002 and its subsequent failure to return to previous trends. The persisting puzzle has the effect of increasing uncertainty around any projection. But it also suggests the potential for substantial returns to further analysis and research for forecasters, like those in this club and us in the Federal Reserve.Footnotes Thank you for the invitation to speak today. As you likely know, I am quite interested in the discipline of enterprise risk management (ERM) and believe roundtables such as this are a useful way to share perspectives and approaches to sound ERM. I know that these roundtables cover a wide range of industry sectors, but today I will, naturally, focus on ERM from a banking perspective. I will use some recent cases in which we believe bankers and supervisors have learned some key lessons about ERM and describe how the lessons learned can be more broadly applied to other industries. But before I start discussing particular examples, I want to take a step back and give you my thoughts on ERM more broadly.General Thoughts on Enterprise Risk ManagementThe financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by emerging technologies and business processes, new financial instruments, the growing scale and scope of financial institutions, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve Board, as the primary supervisor of state member banks and the consolidated supervisor of financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. The Federal Reserve has long emphasized the need for appropriate and strong internal controls in institutions we supervise, and we have taken a continuous-improvement approach to our risk-focused examinations. For many years, enterprise risk management across multiple organizational units within an entity has received increased scrutiny.In some cases, firms may be practicing good risk management on an exposure-by-exposure basis, but they may not be paying close enough attention to aggregation of exposures across the entire organization. Rapid growth can place considerable pressure on, among other areas, an organization\\'s management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, and asset/liability management. An organization must also understand how its various business components, some of which can be quite sophisticated and complex, dynamically interact. A successful ERM process can help to meet many of these challenges.Of course, enterprise risk management is a fairly broad topic that can mean different things to different people. For our purposes here today, I will define ERM as a process that enables management to effectively deal with uncertainty and associated risk and opportunity, enhancing the capacity to build stakeholder value. Borrowing from ERM literature, I would say that ERM includesMany of you are probably familiar with the ERM framework published over a year ago by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework provides a useful way to look at ERM and helps generate further discussion--just what this ERM roundtable is trying to promote.In the COSO framework, ERM consists of eight interrelated components that are derived from the way management runs an enterprise and that are integrated with the management process: (1) internal environment, (2) objective setting, (3) event identification, (4) risk assessment, (5) risk response, (6) control activities, (7) information and communication, and (8) monitoring.Having laid out some general thoughts about ERM within the COSO framework, I would now like to discuss a few recent examples from banking in which the importance of ERM has been highlighted. With the benefit of hindsight, the financial regulators and the industry have been trying to distill the lessons learned from these recent breakdowns in risk management and internal control in the financial services sector.Compliance RiskOne area in which ERM provides tangible value is the area of compliance risk, which can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to an organization\\'s reputation and franchise value. This type of risk may arise when an organization fails to comply with the laws, regulations, or codes of conduct that are applicable to its business activities and functions. The Federal Reserve expects banking organizations to have in place an infrastructure that can identify, monitor, and effectively control the compliance risks that they face. Needless to say, the infrastructure should be commensurate with the nature of the organization\\'s compliance risk. For a large complex banking organization, dealing with compliance risk can be particularly challenging unless it has a well-developed risk-management program.To create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organizations should first understand compliance risk across the entire entity. Managers should be expected to evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually. I should also emphasize the need for the board of directors to establish a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is well communicated throughout the organization by senior management so that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities and their role in implementing the compliance program. Clear lines of communication and authority help to avoid conflicts of interest.An enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program should be dynamic and proactive, meaning it constantly assesses evolving risks when new business lines or activities are added or when existing activities and processes are altered. The process should include an assessment of how those changes may affect the level and nature of risk exposures, and whether mitigating controls are effective in limiting exposures to targeted levels. This understanding must be constantly evolving, to keep up with not only the organization\\'s own products and business strategies, but also regulatory changes. To avoid having a program that operates on autopilot, an organization must continuously reassess its risks and controls and communicate with its business lines. Also, if compliance is seen as a one-off project, undertaken only when a new regulation or product is introduced, a banking organization is placing itself at risk that, down the road, the lack of a compliance process will not sustain the effectiveness of the program as the organization changes.Compliance-risk management can be more difficult for management to integrate into an organization\\'s regular business processes because it often reflects mandates set out by legislation or regulation that the organization itself does not view as key to its success. For example, bankers understand how vital credit-risk management and interest-rate risk management are to their organizations, because they reduce the volatility of earnings and limit losses. On the other hand, regulations that are enacted for broader societal purposes, but that the enterprise sees as of little benefit to its revenue growth, can be viewed as an expensive mandate. For example, the Patriot Act requires significant reporting of transactions to the government, and many in industry have expressed frustration about the burden associated with such reporting. I can assure you, we recognize banking organizations\\' investment in and commitment to compliance with regulatory requirements, including those imposed by anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism regulations. The Federal Reserve will continue to work with our counterparts in the federal government to encourage enhanced feedback on how reporting is contributing to our common fight against money laundering and terrorism.Operational RiskOver the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been increasing its focus on operational risk. For those of you in nonfinancial organizations, the largest share of your enterprise risk is likely to be operational risk, as opposed to credit and interest-rate risk. Banks have learned much from the practices that you have developed over the years. Operational risk has more relevance today for bankers largely because they are able to shed much of their interest-rate and credit risk through sales of loans, use of financial derivatives and sound models to manage the risks that are retained. Further, the revenue streams that are growing the fastest are increasingly related to transaction processing, servicing accounts, and selling sophisticated financial products. To be successful, organizations must have complex systems to execute these activities.Banks are also utilizing advanced models to estimate and manage credit-risk and market-risk exposures. Growing use of sophisticated models requires stronger risk-management practices since weaknesses in the models\\' operational design and data integrity can lead to significant losses. Thus, effective risk management requires financial institutions to have more-knowledgeable employees to identify system requirements, monitor their effectiveness, and interpret model results appropriately.We have learned quite a bit about operational risk from our examinations of banking organizations. For example, during routine examinations of activities that pose operational risk, we look at the adequacy of banks\\' procedures, processes, and internal controls. Such reviews include transaction testing of control routines in higher-risk activities. For example, a bank\\'s wire transfer activities and loan administration functions are often targeted for review, and our experiences have identified some common weaknesses in operational control that are worthy of attention.With wire transfers and similar transactions, a banking organization could suffer a significant financial loss from unauthorized transfers and incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risks are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from our reviews are to (1) establish reasonable approval and authorization requirements for wire transactions to ensure that an appropriate level of management is aware of the transaction and to establish better accountability; (2) establish call-back procedures, passwords, funds transfer agreements, and other authentication controls related to customers\\' wire transfer requests; and (3) pay increased attention to authentication controls, since this area may also be particularly susceptible to external fraud.Loan administration is another area where banking organizations could suffer significant financial losses from inappropriate segregation of duties or lack of dual controls. An institution could also incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risk factors are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from these types of reviews that may be applied to corporations more generally are to (1) ensure that loan officers do not have the ability to book and maintain their own loans; (2) limit employee access to those loan system computer applications that are inconsistent with their responsibilities; and (3) provide line staff with consistent guidance, in the form of policies and procedures, on how to identify and handle unusual transactions.Operational Risk Arising In Recent Financial RestatementsRisks can sometimes quickly appear where they were not traditionally expected. For example, consider the changes we have seen in financial reporting quality of corporations in all industries. In 2005, there were approximately 1,200 restatements of previously filed financial statements by publicly traded companies--twice the rate for 2004. The complexity of GAAP accounting standards and a more stringent, literal interpretation of the application of those standards by auditors and regulatory bodies, primarily the Securities and Exchange Commission, are two major factors that have led to the restatements.Examples of prominent restatements include FAS 133 hedge accounting and lease accounting issues. In the area of hedge accounting, the restatements generally resulted from the misapplication of the \"short-cut\" method. The organizations in question did not satisfy all of the criteria for use of the short-cut method but, nonetheless, utilized hedge accounting treatment allowed by this method.In the area of lease accounting issues, most companies simply failed to apply longstanding accounting standards related to revenue recognition reserves, accruals and contingencies, and equity accounting. Most companies believed they were actually reporting correctly prior to the restatements. Virtually all of these companies were audited by auditing firms that are now registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB\\'s inspection process, which involves close scrutiny of registered firms, may be a factor in the increased number of restatements.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires each annual report of a public company to include a report by management on the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Looking only at banking organizations, as a result of restatements, the number of material weaknesses in internal control for the 2004 reporting period has been revised up to 52 from the 37 originally reported. This increase implies a significant amount of operational risk associated with the accounting process.Generally, examiners review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has a clear understanding of the roles of the audit committee, management, internal audit, and the external auditor and whether the organization has implemented an effective plan to achieve the objectives and requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley 404. Examiners also review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has an effective follow-up strategy for the remediation of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Examiners are encouraged to utilize the results of the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process, where possible, in their overall assessment of the organization\\'s risk management and control process and in the risk scoping of safety-and-soundness examinations and inspections.Information SecurityCyber attacks and security breaches involving nonpublic customer information appear in the headlines almost every week. These events have cost the financial services industry millions of dollars in direct losses and have done considerable reputational damage. The cost of identity theft to affected consumers is also significant. With banking organizations increasingly using the Internet to interact with customers, business partners, and service providers, concerns about the use of the Internet as a communication and delivery channel have resulted in the need for and use of more-sophisticated control mechanisms, such as enterprise-wide firewall protections, multifactor authentication schemes, and virtual private-network connections.While many of the widely publicized information security breaches have involved parties outside the affected banking organization accessing the organization\\'s customer information, organizations also remain at risk for breaches or misuses of information by an insider. During our examination activities, we have seen breakdowns in internal control, resulting in operating losses that were traced back to weak controls over insiders\\' access to information technology systems interfacing with electronic funds transfer networks. Further investigation into these situations suggests that the duration and magnitude of the fraud and resulting losses is a direct function of the internal party\\'s access to accounting and related systems.Several lessons have emerged. First, institutions should tightly control logical access to funds transfer systems and ensure that access settings enforce separation of duties, dual controls, and management sign-offs. Second, an institution\\'s senior management should be restricted from regular access to business-line functional systems, especially funds transfer systems. When such restriction is impractical, additional controls must be in place and functioning effectively. Finally, effective management of information security risk, even when focused on a specific function, requires an enterprise-wide approach to yield a true and complete evaluation of the associated risks.Mutual Funds Well-publicized instances of late trading and market timing at mutual fund firms, and the related investigations, have involved many businesses, including banking, securities, and insurance firms. These types of breakdowns in internal control result in sanctions or financial loss and adversely affect a firm\\'s reputation and franchise value.I would like to highlight a few lessons learned from our experience in investigating control breaches in these mutual fund cases. One of the most obvious is the need to critically evaluate unusual client relationships that require variances from standard procedures. If a high percentage of compensation is derived from a single client, a red flag should immediately go up. Also, organizations should have a formal process for reviewing and approving unique products, customers, and services at the inception of the client relationship. Further, it is always a good idea to shine some light on areas historically labeled \"low risk\" to validate that assessment. The low occurrence of loss from an activity should not be the only factor considered when assessing risk.Finally, compensation systems that reward employees for sales without adequately monitoring their internal control breaches can create a conflict between the interest of employees and the interest of the enterprise. As companies move away from straight salaries to more incentive-based systems, it is important that personnel departments be included in an effective enterprise-wide risk-management program to consider how changes in compensation practices affect risks to the enterprise.Credit DerivativesFinally, I would now like to turn to one more issue that has relevance to ERM, and that is the importance of companies including an ERM perspective as they design and build new lines of business. As many of you might know, last year a dialogue between supervisors and credit derivatives dealers was initiated to support industry efforts to address weaknesses in the operations surrounding credit default swaps (CDS). While we view these new instruments as an effective way to diversify and mitigate risks related to credit exposures from corporations, an industry-led study, the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II report, identified significant weaknesses in the infrastructure supporting sales and risk monitoring of these instruments. While the report identified 47 recommendations, regulators in the United States and other countries have focused on two major weaknesses.One weakness is related to the success of the product. Volume of trades has grown so quickly and reached such a significant volume that broker-dealers are not able to keep up with their paper-based systems to record the trades and document the transactions. As a result, significant backlogs of confirmations of these over-the-counter derivatives have built up. This creates concerns that information feeding risk-management systems--information about the volume, term, and counterparty to the trade--is not complete. This problem would be exacerbated in a stress situation, when positions need to be changed very quickly to mitigate risk.Another weakness relates to the lack of discipline in enforcing contract terms. Any time an instrument is traded over the counter, it is important to know who you are doing business with. Since an exchange does not stand between the two sides of the trade, parties make payments directly to each other to honor the terms of the contracts. The market practice is to use collateral or pricing to mitigate the risk that the other side of the trade cannot perform per the agreement. The recent industry study also found that competitive pressures were such that brokers did not enforce the standard CDS agreement and allowed counterparties to assign their side of the trade to another party without notifying the broker. Obviously, this can significantly change the risk profile of a transaction and also make it very difficult to settle payments in a timely manner.About six weeks ago, fourteen major market participants published a letter reiterating their commitment to improving the infrastructure that supports the credit derivatives markets. The market participants are committed to the development and implementation of a set of industrywide guidelines that include a targeted reduction in each market participant\\'s confirmation backlogs and assurance that agreement terms will be enforced. Additionally, the fourteen participants will work to create a largely electronic marketplace where all trades will be processed through an industry-accepted platform, develop a new set of processing standards for those trades that cannot be confirmed electronically, and establish a new procedure for settlement following a credit event.We are generally pleased with both the industry\\'s self-identification of the issues and its commitment to making improvements. But for purposes of our discussion of ERM today, the problems surrounding CDS sales highlight the challenges risk managers face when market pressures make the firm\\'s line management reluctant to initiate appropriate controls on their own. It also illustrates that in new lines of business, sometimes ERM must go outside the enterprise and work with competitors to support the growth of shared systems and standards to mitigate risks.ConclusionAt the Federal Reserve, we believe that all banking organizations need good risk management. An enterprise-wide approach is appropriate for setting objectives across the organization, instilling an enterprise-wide culture, and ensuring that key activities and risks are being monitored regularly. Senior management must be involved in ERM, since they are the ones who decide the level and types of risk the organization is comfortable with accepting and what controls and risk mitigants will be employed to ensure that risk exposures stay within the agreed-upon levels.In addition, it is important for organizations to make sure they do not ignore or accidentally overlook lower-profile activities that still might bear substantial risks. As I noted, such activities can include financial statement reporting, information security, and back-office systems. And operational risk, more broadly, has the potential to create disruptions for the organization that could reduce the value of the organization. Often, the solutions to these problems are basics such as training, developing internal controls, and establishing the appropriate culture across the organization. Therefore, organizations should look at the discipline of enterprise risk management as a way to ensure that they effectively deal with uncertainty and the associated risk and opportunity.Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before the Joint Economic Committee to offer my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and on some of the major economic challenges that the nation faces. \\nPartly because of last year\\'s devastating hurricanes, and partly because of some temporary or special factors, economic activity decelerated noticeably late last year. The growth of the real gross domestic product (GDP) slowed from an average annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the first three quarters of 2005 to less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter. Since then, however, with some rebound in activity under way in the Gulf Coast region and continuing expansion in most other parts of the country, the national economy appears to have grown briskly. Among the key economic indicators, growth in nonfarm payroll employment picked up in November and December, and job gains averaged about 200,000 per month between January and March. Consumer spending and business investment, as inferred from data on motor vehicle sales, retail sales, and shipments of capital goods, are also on track to post sizable first-quarter increases. In light of these signs of strength, most private-sector forecasters, such as those included in the latest Blue Chip survey, estimate that real GDP grew between 4 and 5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. \\nIf we smooth through the recent quarter-to-quarter variations, we see that the pace of economic growth has been strong for the past three years, averaging nearly 4 percent at an annual rate since the middle of 2003. Much of this growth can be attributed to a substantial expansion in the productive capacity of the U.S. economy, which in turn is largely the result of impressive gains in productivity--that is, in output per hour worked. However, a portion of the recent growth reflects the taking up of economic slack that had developed during the period of economic weakness earlier in the decade. Over the past year, for example, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1/2 percentage point, the number of people working part time for economic reasons has declined to its lowest level since August 2001, and the rate of capacity utilization in the industrial sector has moved up 1-1/2 percentage points. As the utilization rates of labor and capital approach their maximum sustainable levels, continued growth in output--if it is to be sustainable and non-inflationary--should be at a rate consistent with the growth in the productive capacity of the economy. Admittedly, determining the rates of capital and labor utilization consistent with stable long-term growth is fraught with difficulty, not least because they tend to vary with economic circumstances. Nevertheless, to allow the expansion to continue in a healthy fashion and to avoid the risk of higher inflation, policymakers must do their best to help to ensure that the aggregate demand for goods and services does not persistently exceed the economy\\'s underlying productive capacity. \\nBased on the information in hand, it seems reasonable to expect that economic growth will moderate toward a more sustainable pace as the year progresses. In particular, one sector that is showing signs of softening is the residential housing market. Both new and existing home sales have dropped back, on net, from their peaks of last summer and early fall. And, while unusually mild weather gave a lift to new housing starts earlier this year, the reading for March points to a slowing in the pace of homebuilding as well. House prices, which have increased rapidly during the past several years, appear to be in the process of decelerating, which will imply slower additions to household wealth and, thereby, less impetus to consumer spending. At this point, the available data on the housing market, together with ongoing support for housing demand from factors such as strong job creation and still-low mortgage rates, suggest that this sector will most likely experience a gradual cooling rather than a sharp slowdown. However, significant uncertainty attends the outlook for housing, and the risk exists that a slowdown more pronounced than we currently expect could prove a drag on growth this year and next. The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor housing markets closely. \\nMore broadly, the prospects for maintaining economic growth at a solid pace in the period ahead appear good, although growth rates may well vary quarter to quarter as the economy downshifts from the first-quarter spurt. Productivity growth, job creation, and capital spending are all strong, and continued expansion in the economies of our trading partners seems likely to boost our export sector. That said, energy prices remain a concern: The nominal price of crude oil has risen recently to new highs, and gasoline prices are also up sharply. Rising energy prices pose risks to both economic activity and inflation. If energy prices stabilize this year, even at a high level, their adverse effects on both growth and inflation should diminish somewhat over time. However, as the world has little spare oil production capacity, periodic spikes in oil prices remain a possibility. \\nThe outlook for inflation is reasonably favorable but carries some risks. Increases in energy prices have pushed up overall consumer price inflation over the past year or so. However, inflation in core price indexes, which in the past has been a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends, has remained roughly stable over the past year. Among the factors restraining core inflation are ongoing gains in productivity, which have helped to hold unit labor costs in check, and strong domestic and international competition in product markets, which have restrained the ability of firms to pass cost increases on to consumers. The stability of core inflation is also enhanced by the fact that long-term inflation expectations--as measured by surveys and by comparing yields on nominal and indexed Treasury securities--appear to remain well-anchored. Of course, inflation expectations will remain low only so long as the Federal Reserve demonstrates its commitment to price stability. As to inflation risks, I have already noted that continuing growth in aggregate demand in excess of increases in the economy\\'s underlying productive capacity would likely lead to increased inflationary pressures. In addition, although pass-through from energy and commodity price increases to core inflation has thus far been limited, the risk exists that strengthening demand for final products could allow firms to pass on a greater portion of their cost increases in the future. \\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised the federal funds rate, in increments of 25 basis points, at each of its past fifteen meetings, bringing its current level to 4.75 percent. This sequence of rate increases was necessary to remove the unusual monetary accommodation put in place in response to the soft economic conditions earlier in this decade. Future policy actions will be increasingly dependent on the evolution of the economic outlook, as reflected in the incoming data. Specifically, policy will respond to arriving information that affects the Committee\\'s assessment of the medium-term risks to its objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. Focusing on the medium-term forecast horizon is necessary because of the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy. \\nIn the statement issued after its March meeting, the FOMC noted that economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. It further noted that a number of factors have contributed to the stability in core inflation. However, the Committee also viewed the possibility that core inflation might rise as a risk to the achievement of its mandated objectives, and it judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In my view, data arriving since the meeting have not materially changed that assessment of the risks. To support continued healthy growth of the economy, vigilance in regard to inflation is essential. \\nThe FOMC will continue to monitor the incoming data closely to assess the prospects for both growth and inflation. In particular, even if in the Committee\\'s judgment the risks to its objectives are not entirely balanced, at some point in the future the Committee may decide to take no action at one or more meetings in the interest of allowing more time to receive information relevant to the outlook. Of course, a decision to take no action at a particular meeting does not preclude actions at subsequent meetings, and the Committee will not hesitate to act when it determines that doing so is needed to foster the achievement of the Federal Reserve\\'s mandated objectives. \\nAlthough recent economic developments have been positive, the nation still faces some significant longer-term economic challenges. One such challenge is putting the federal budget on a trajectory that will be sustainable as our society ages. Under current law, federal spending for retirement and health programs will grow substantially in coming decades--both as a share of overall federal spending and relative to the size of the economy--especially if health costs continue to climb rapidly. Slower growth of the workforce may also reduce growth in economic activity and thus in tax revenues. \\nThe broad dimensions of the problem are well-known. In fiscal year 2005, federal outlays for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid totaled about 8 percent of GDP. According to the projections of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), by the year 2020 that share will increase by more than three percentage points of GDP, an amount about equal in size to the current federal deficit. By 2040, according to the CBO, the share of GDP devoted to those three programs (excluding contributions by the states) will double from current levels, to about 16 percent of GDP. Were these projections to materialize, the Congress would find itself in the position of having to eliminate essentially all other non-interest spending, raising federal taxes to levels well above their long-term average of about 18 percent of GDP, or choosing some combination of the two. Absent such actions, we would see widening and eventually unsustainable budget deficits, which would impede capital accumulation, slow economic growth, threaten financial stability, and put a heavy burden of debt on our children and grandchildren. \\nThe resolution of the nation\\'s long-run fiscal challenge will require hard choices. Fundamentally, the decision confronting the Congress and the American people is how large a share of the nation\\'s economic resources should be devoted to federal government programs, including transfer programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In making that decision, the full range of benefits and costs associated with each program should be taken into account. Crucially, however, whatever size of government is chosen, tax rates will ultimately have to be set at a level sufficient to achieve a reasonable balance of spending and revenues in the long run. Members of the Congress who want to extend tax cuts and keep tax rates low must accept that low rates will be sustainable over time only if outlays can be held down sufficiently to avoid large deficits. Likewise, members who favor a more expansive role of the government must balance the benefits of government programs with the burden imposed by the additional taxes needed to pay for them, a burden that includes not only the resources transferred from the private sector but also the reductions in the efficiency and growth potential of the economy associated with higher tax rates. \\nAnother important challenge is the large and widening deficit in the U.S. current account. This deficit has increased from a little more than $100 billion in 1995 to roughly $800 billion last year, or 6-1/2 percent of nominal GDP. The causes of this deficit are complex and include both domestic and international factors. Fundamentally, the current account deficit reflects the fact that capital investment in the United States, including residential construction, substantially exceeds U.S. national saving. The opposite situation exists abroad, in that the saving of our trading partners exceeds their own capital investment. The excess of domestic investment over domestic saving in the United States, which by definition is the same as the current account deficit, must be financed by net inflows of funds from investors abroad. To date, the United States has had little difficulty in financing its current account deficit, as foreign savers have found U.S. investments attractive and foreign official institutions have added to their stocks of dollar-denominated international reserves. However, the cumulative effect of years of current account deficits have caused the United States to switch from being an international creditor to an international debtor, with a net foreign debt position of more than $3 trillion, roughly 25 percent of a year\\'s GDP. This trend cannot continue forever, as it would imply an ever-growing interest burden owed to foreign creditors. Moreover, as foreign holdings of U.S. assets increase, at some point foreigners may become less willing to add these assets to their portfolios. While it is likely that current account imbalances will be resolved gradually over time, there is a small risk of a sudden shift in sentiment that could lead to disruptive changes in the value of the dollar and in other asset prices. \\nActions both here and abroad would contribute to a gradual reduction in the U.S. current account deficit and in its mirror image, the current account surpluses of our trading partners. To reduce its dependence on foreign capital, the United States should take action to increase its national saving rate. The most direct way to accomplish this objective would be by putting federal government finances on a more sustainable path. Our trading partners can help to mitigate the global imbalance by relying less on exports as a source of growth, and instead boosting domestic spending relative to their production. In this regard, some policymakers in developing Asia, including China, appear to have recognized the importance of giving domestic demand a greater role in their development strategies and are seeking to increase domestic spending through fiscal measures, financial reforms, and other initiatives. Such actions should be encouraged. For these countries, allowing greater flexibility in exchange rates would be an important additional step toward helping to restore greater balance both in global capital flows and in their own economies. Structural reforms to enhance growth in our industrial trading partners could also be helpful. Each of these actions would be in the long-term interests of the countries involved, regardless of their effects on external imbalances. On the other hand, raising barriers to trade or flows of capital is not a constructive approach for addressing the current account deficit because such barriers would have significant deleterious effects on both the U.S. and global economies. \\nIn conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the economy has been performing well and the near-term prospects look good, although as always there are risks to the outlook. Monetary policy will continue to pursue its objectives of helping the economy to grow at a strong, sustainable pace while seeking to keep inflation firmly under control. And, while many of the fundamental factors that determine longer-term economic growth appear favorable, actions to move the federal budget toward a more sustainable position would do a great deal to help ensure the future prosperity of our country.',\n",
              "       ' A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, May 10, 2006 at 8:30 a.m.Mr. Hoenig, Ms. Minehan, and Messrs. Moskow and Poole, \\n       Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market CommitteeMessrs. Fisher and Stern, Presidents of the Federal Reserve \\nBanks of Dallas and Minneapolis, respectivelyMr. Stone, First Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of PhiladelphiaMessrs.

Fuhrer and Rosenblum, Executive Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Dallas, respectivelyMessrs. Evans and Hakkio, Ms. Mester, and Mr. Rasche, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, respectivelyMr. Hilton, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkMr. Potter, Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkMr. Weber, Senior Research Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisMr. Hetzel, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of RichmondThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 2006 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico.  The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent.  Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The vote to renew the System\\'s participation in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  Mr. Lacker dissented because of his opposition, as indicated at the January meeting, to foreign exchange market intervention by the Federal Reserve, which such swap arrangements facilitate, and because of his opposition to direct lending to foreign central banks.By unanimous vote, the Committee delegated the authority to review and determine appeals of a denial of access to Committee records under FOIA and other rules to the Board members designated as the primary and alternate Administrative Governors for Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Matters.  Also by unanimous vote, the Committee established a FOIA Requester Service Center and designated Carol R. Low to fulfill the associated responsibilities.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity expanded strongly in the first quarter and that gains were widespread across most categories of final sales.  Consumer spending posted a sizable increase, driven by January\\'s bounceback in motor vehicle purchases and an acceleration in spending on other goods at the turn of the year.  In addition, favorable weather boosted housing construction early in the quarter.  Later in the quarter, however, the pace of consumer spending moderated, and housing starts retraced their earlier run-up.  Business investment spending strengthened in the first quarter, in part because of a surge in the purchases of transportation and high-tech equipment and a step-up in nonresidential construction.  Manufacturing production also posted solid gains in the first quarter and payroll growth moderated a bit in April after robust gains in employment in the first quarter.  Overall consumer prices jumped in March because of higher energy prices, while core prices rose a bit more rapidly than in earlier months.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 138,000 jobs in April following robust growth in March.  The gains in April were widespread: Manufacturing and related industries registered significant increases, mining activity and employment were boosted by rising energy prices, construction hiring posted a moderate gain, and a range of services-producing industries strengthened, with the important exception of retail trade, which more than reversed its March gains.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April.  The increases in the workweek and employment in April led to notable growth in aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers.  The unemployment rate edged down to 4.7 percent in March and remained at that level in April.Industrial production in March expanded at about the same strong pace as it did in February, with gains posted across all major components of the index.  Manufacturing activity picked up in March after a lull in February.  While manufacturing growth for the first quarter as a whole slowed from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it exceeded that of the previous year.  Manufacturing capacity utilization during the quarter was a bit above its long-run average.  Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--strengthened in the first quarter as a whole.  Within the quarter, however, the boost from hurricane-related recovery seemed to ebb.  While utility output surged in February and moved up a bit more in March, these increases only partly reversed the weather-related plunge in January.Growth of consumer spending appeared to moderate after posting sizable gains around the turn of the year.  Excluding motor vehicles, real outlays rose temperately in March, boosted by the continued rise in spending on services.  Spending on goods excluding motor vehicles posted a second-straight monthly decline after robust gains over the previous four months.  Sales of light vehicles held steady in March and picked up a bit in April, bringing the average pace for the year well above that of the fourth quarter but about even with the rate of last year.  Although continued improvements in the labor market had been generating considerable gains in nominal wage and salary income, rising gasoline prices held down the increase in real disposable personal income in March and were expected to damp it in April as well.  Ongoing increases in home prices and additional gains in the stock market, however, further boosted household wealth during the first quarter.  Measures of consumer confidence remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.The underlying pace of residential activity seemed to moderate in the first quarter.  After unseasonably warm weather allowed a high level of single-family housing starts in January and February, starts fell in March to their lowest level in a year.  New permit issuance for single-family homes also fell in March, continuing its downward trend.  Multifamily starts recovered a bit in March from their low rate in February but remained well within their historical range.  Home sales also declined, on net, in recent months.  Although sales of existing single-family homes edged up in February and March, the level of sales for the first quarter as a whole was notably below the record high in the second quarter of last year.  Sales of new homes also moved up in March, but their average in the first quarter was down substantially from the peak in the third quarter of last year.  House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.  Growth in the average sales price of existing homes in March, versus a year earlier, decelerated sharply, and the average price for new homes in March fell compared to a year earlier. In addition, other indicators, such as months\\' supply of both new and existing homes for sale and the index of pending home sales, supported the view that housing markets had cooled in recent months.Real outlays for equipment and software surged in the first quarter after a relatively subdued performance in the fourth quarter of last year.  Much of the growth reflected a sharp jump in business purchases of transportation equipment, such as airplanes and motor vehicles.  Spending on high-tech equipment and software also improved as exceptionally strong growth in expenditures for communications equipment more than compensated for fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and on software.  Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector improved noticeably.  Although spending on nonresidential building construction remained well short of the robust levels seen in late 2000, growth of expenditures in this sector was at its fastest pace in the first quarter in nearly six years.  Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in the first quarter, and available data pointed to ongoing growth.Real nonfarm inventories stepped down in the first quarter, largely reflecting a decline in investment in motor vehicle inventories.  Excluding motor vehicles, inventories increased at a pace well above that in the fourth quarter.  Over the past twelve months, inventories relative to shipments and sales had moved down moderately on balance, extending the long-run downward trend.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as a sharp decrease in imports more than offset a modest fall in exports.  The declines in both categories were generally widespread across sectors with the exception of oil imports, which were flat, and imported services, which rose.  Incoming data for foreign industrial economies were generally favorable and pointed to continued expansion.  Available data showed continued growth in GDP in the United Kingdom in the first quarter, continuing strong domestic demand in Canada through February, ongoing recovery in Japan, and a first-quarter rebound in euro-area economic performance.Headline inflation turned up in March.  Although the price of natural gas had fallen because of continued plentiful inventories, retail gasoline prices surged, leading to a jump in overall energy prices for the month.  Prices of core goods and services also rose more quickly in March, largely because of a spike in the apparel component that unwound a decline in February and a one-time step-up in medical prices related to changes in Medicare reimbursement rules.  During the twelve months ending in March, overall inflation rose at a slightly faster pace than that in the preceding twelve-month period, while core prices for the same period increased a bit more slowly than in the previous year.  Producer price inflation also moved up in March, driven largely by higher food and energy prices.  Readings on the growth in the cost of labor were mixed.  Over the three months ending in March, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at its slowest pace in several years.  Data on compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, however, pointed toward notably faster growth in the first quarter.  Some financial-market and survey indicators suggested that inflation expectations, both for the upcoming year and for the longer term, had moved up since the March meeting.At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4¾ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that the slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seemed largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but seemed likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.  As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations had remained contained.  Still, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance, but reiterated that in any event the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Investors anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its March meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, but the Committee\\'s post-meeting statement evidently led them to mark up somewhat their expected path for the federal funds rate.  Subsequently, the path was pushed up further by data releases that were, on balance, stronger than market participants had expected.  Speeches by Federal Reserve officials, the minutes of the March meeting, and Congressional testimony by the Chairman combined to restrain policy expectations some.  On net, the anticipated path of the federal funds rate over the next two years nonetheless rotated upward.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities moved up over the intermeeting period, but yields on nominal Treasury issues rose more.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds declined.  Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates.The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major foreign currencies fell since the March meeting.  Increased focus in public debate on the risks posed by the large U.S. external imbalance appeared to erode investor support for the dollar.Domestic nonfinancial sector debt was estimated to have grown at a robust pace in the first quarter, down only slightly from the brisk pace of 2005.  Business sector debt appeared to have expanded strongly, supported by significant net issuance of U.S. corporate bonds and double-digit growth of business loans at commercial banks.  In the household sector, consumer credit continued to rise slowly, and the growth of household mortgage debt was thought, based on limited data, to have moderated somewhat in the first quarter against a backdrop of higher mortgage interest rates and some signs of a deceleration in house prices.  M2 advanced at a pace somewhat below that of nominal GDP in the first quarter and was estimated to have expanded moderately in April.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters.  The projected deceleration of real GDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary policy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth, and reduced stimulus from fiscal policy.  While higher energy prices were expected to boost inflation in the near term, structural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher energy and material costs was thought likely to moderate.  Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly so far this year after the slowing of growth in the fourth quarter.  The advance in output had been vigorous in the first quarter of this year, with real GDP increasing at around a 5 percent annual rate.  Although the expansion appeared likely to moderate, it evidently remained solid.  Inflation pressures appeared to be somewhat greater than the Committee had anticipated at the time of its March meeting.  Consumer prices recently had risen at a pace noticeably above the average rise over the previous twelve months.  Also, prices of energy and many other commodities had climbed sharply of late, and inflation expectations appeared to have risen slightly.  If economic growth continued to moderate over coming quarters, as anticipated, pressures on productive resources would most likely continue to be limited.  Most participants expected that, after allowing for some possible near-term volatility related to the recent jump in energy and other commodity prices, core inflation would probably remain around the levels experienced on average over the past year.  However, recent developments suggested that upside risks to inflation had risen somewhat since the time of the March meeting.In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, some participants noted that growth of household spending was likely to slow over the remainder of the year.  Anecdotal information pointed to some cooling of housing markets.  That cooling was especially noticeable for high-end homes and for houses in markets that previously had experienced the steepest appreciation.  Data on home sales, permits, and starts on the whole likewise suggested that activity was gradually diminishing.  Some reports indicated that speculative building of homes had dropped off considerably, but inventories of unsold homes still seemed to be expanding.  Although fresh comprehensive data were not available, home prices on average appeared still to be rising, but at a slower pace than over the past few years.  Going forward, growth in consumption spending was likely to be supported by gains in employment and personal income.  But slower appreciation of home prices and the effects of the increases in energy prices and interest rates that had already occurred would likely act to restrain consumption spending somewhat.  Certain features of recently popular nontraditional mortgage products had the potential to cause financial difficulties for some households and erode mortgage loan performance for some lenders.  Nonetheless, the household sector seemed likely to remain in sound financial condition overall.  On balance, consumption spending was viewed as most likely to expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters.Several participants remarked that business investment spending was robust.  Nonresidential construction was accelerating notably, in the process absorbing some of the resources that were being diverted from housing.  Office vacancy rates were declining, spurring construction of new office buildings.  Drilling and mining activity was said to be particularly strong, propelled by the high levels of energy prices.  Investment in equipment and software appeared to be expanding at a solid rate.  Capital formation was likely to continue to be supported by rising output, strong balance sheets in the business sector, and ready availability of financing on attractive terms.Some participants commented on the recent surge in federal tax revenues, a development that was being mirrored at the state level.  While the precise reasons for the increase in federal receipts were not entirely clear, robust income growth was probably an important factor.  In any case, the effect was to trim the current federal budget deficit noticeably.  Nonetheless, the longer-run federal fiscal imbalance remained a serious concern.Data on economic growth outside the United States indicated that the global expansion was firming, a sense amplified by reports from international contacts.  The apparent strengthening of global growth was likely to support U.S. exports and economic activity and would also tend to maintain upward pressures on energy and commodity prices.Meeting participants expressed some concern about recent price developments and their implications for inflation prospects.  Core consumer inflation lately had been a little higher than expected.  Moreover, energy prices had risen steeply in the period since the March meeting, and, although pass-through apparently had been limited to date, the most recent increases might be reflected to a greater degree in core inflation in coming months.  Participants noted that prices of non-energy commodities, such as industrial metals and building supplies, also had been climbing.  The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.  Business contacts had reported continued shortages of certain types of skilled labor and related wage pressures in some occupations, which would tend to boost costs.However, participants also cited some factors that could be expected to restrain inflation.  Although alternative measures of labor compensation provided divergent readings, growth of total compensation on balance appeared to remain moderate.  And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services.  While firms would seek to maintain those margins, recent experience suggested that this might be accomplished in part through further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters, rather than through more rapid price hikes.Participants discussed in some detail inflation expectations--a potentially important factor influencing future inflation trends.  Some surveys suggested that inflation expectations had risen in recent weeks, but others implied that expectations were little changed.  Measures of inflation compensation based on the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed issues had edged higher.  It was possible, though, that investors\\' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.  On balance, participants judged that inflation expectations had risen somewhat--a development that would have to be taken into account in policymaking and warranted close monitoring--but remained contained.Although the Committee discussed policy approaches ranging from leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting to increasing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, all members believed that an additional 25 basis point firming of policy was appropriate today to keep inflation from rising and promote sustainable economic expansion.  Recent price developments argued for another firming step at today\\'s meeting.  Core inflation recently had been a bit higher than had been expected, and several members remarked that core inflation was now around the upper end of what they viewed as an acceptable range.  Moreover, a number of factors were augmenting the upside risks to inflation:  the surge in energy and commodity prices, some recent weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and the possibility that the apparent increase in inflation expectations could, if it persisted, impart momentum to inflation.  In addition, the economy appeared to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization and had been growing quite strongly, and whether economic growth would moderate to a sustainable pace was not yet clear.  At the same time, members also saw downside risks to economic activity.  For example, the cumulative effect of past monetary policy actions and the recent rise in longer-term interest rates on housing activity and prices could turn out to be larger than expected.  Still, it seemed most likely that, with modest further policy action, including a 25 basis point firming today, growth in activity would moderate gradually over coming quarters, pressures on resources would remain limited, and core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year.Given the risks to growth and inflation, Committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed after today\\'s action.  In view of the risk that the outlook for inflation could worsen, the Committee decided to repeat the indication in the policy statement released after the March meeting that some further policy firming could be required.  However, the Committee agreed to emphasize that \"the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.\"  Members debated the appropriate characterization of inflation expectations in the statement.  Low and stable inflation expectations were key to the attainment of the Committee\\'s dual objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.  However, the apparent pickup in longer-term expectations, while worrisome, was relatively small.  They remained within the range seen over the past couple of years, and the increase could well reverse before long.  Accordingly, it appeared appropriate to characterize inflation expectations again as \"contained.\"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, \\nMs. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, Lacker, and Olson, \\nMs. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action: None.During the interval between the March and May meetings, Chairman Bernanke had appointed a subcommittee on communications issues to be chaired by Governor Kohn and including Presidents Stern and Yellen.  At today\\'s meeting, Governor Kohn indicated that the objective of the subcommittee was to help the Committee frame and organize discussion of a broad range of such issues over coming meetings.The meeting adjourned at 1:10 p.m.Notation Vote\\nBy notation vote completed on April 17, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held on March 27-28, 2006.Return to topFOMC I would like to thank Operation HOPE and the host committee for inviting me to participate in today\\'s summit. I would also like to congratulate John Bryant and the staff of the Anacostia HOPE Center on this anniversary and on your many contributions to this community over the past year. I recently visited the HOPE Center and saw some of the services it offers in financial education, small business development, job training, and computer literacy. These activities contribute to the revitalization of this community by helping residents gain access to resources they can use to improve their economic situations and prospects. Institutions such as the HOPE Center and THEARC (Town Hall Education, Arts, and Recreation Campus) bring people together and give them a sense of being part of a larger community.Today, I will share some thoughts on economic revitalization, highlighting two general themes. The first theme is the importance in community economic development of strategic collaboration among public, private, and nonprofit organizations. Working together, these three groups of actors can achieve much more than they could on their own. The second theme is the need for a comprehensive approach to revitalizing communities, one that focuses on the economic and cultural viability of the community as a whole, not only on the construction or rehabilitation of individual homes and businesses. In my remarks I will focus on the experience of the Anacostia neighborhood in the District of Columbia, which offers useful illustrations of both themes.Anacostia: Looking BackTo think about Anacostia\\'s future it helps first to recall its past. I recently toured some of the neighborhoods southeast of the Anacostia River and gained an appreciation for both the rich history of the area and its great promise. Many of the buildings in this area are architectural treasures. The older houses date from the late 1800s, when Anacostia was home to a large working-class community. The residents included, of course, Frederick Douglass, known as the Sage of Anacostia, a man whose dedication to lifelong learning and to the battle for racial equality still has the capacity to inspire.However, the pattern of residential construction and homeownership in Anacostia changed dramatically over the following decades. During the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, policies designed to eradicate tenements in central D.C. resulted in Anacostia, with its relatively large tracts of undeveloped land, becoming home to large numbers of lower-income families displaced from other parts of the city. In the 1950s and 1960s, the growth of the city\\'s population, the expansion of the central business district to accommodate the burgeoning federal government, and urban renewal projects led to substantial increases in the demand for new housing in the city, particularly for lower-income residents. By 1967, the need for affordable housing in the District led the planning commission to call for the construction of 65,000 units of new housing, with 30,000 of those units to be located in Anacostia.The result of these developments was an apartment-construction boom that ultimately changed the character of the area. As the community\\'s stock of public and rental housing increased, Anacostia shifted from being a community of homeowners to one of renters, with a high concentration of lower-income households. As we have seen in other cities, large-scale public housing projects have often become liabilities to the community. Anacostia struggled as public housing complexes fell into disrepair, many homes were abandoned, crime rates increased, and poverty rates climbed. The economic vitality of this historic community was undermined, and previously healthy neighborhoods were destabilized.Anacostia TodayToday, however, Anacostia looks to be on the way back. Leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors have a new vision for the area--one of mixed-income neighborhoods, vibrant commercial and retail centers, expanded neighborhood amenities, and strong community institutions. These partners are playing different but complementary roles, bringing both capital and expertise and ushering in a new wave of economic development in the area.In the public sector, both the federal and city governments are supporting development in Anacostia through their investments, often leveraged with private money. On the federal side, for example, the Department of Homeland Security\\'s new communications center and other planned development on the St. Elizabeth\\'s property will bring jobs and economic activity to the neighborhood. The city of Washington is making a number of important investments here as well. For example, the Anacostia Gateway project will include two buildings, one that will house offices of the D.C. government, the other (which will be a joint venture of the Anacostia Economic Development Corporation and the National Capital Revitalization Corporation) providing commercial office space. The city has also made a major commitment for the construction of a baseball stadium, as you know. In the sphere of housing, an entirely new community is rising up at Henson Ridge, bringing residents with a range of incomes. The city took a leadership role in this project, demolishing the public housing previously on the site and then arranging the financing of the new construction through a combination of public bond issuance, private equity, and a successful competitive proposal to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.But public investments alone are generally not sufficient to re-establish the economic viability of a community. For development to be truly sustainable, private capital is also needed. Successful private investment in economically challenged areas can be rewarding, but it requires substantial expertise, local knowledge, and a vision of what the community can become. In this community, several innovative private developers have shown what is possible by collaborating with the city, financial institutions, and nonprofit organizations to rehabilitate and construct thousands of new mixed-income housing units for both renters and owners.A key element in the success of much of this private-led development is the insight that, to achieve economically viable communities, building housing units is not enough. For people to find an area an attractive place to live, they need a range of services, community institutions, and places to shop and work. Accordingly, developers building in Anacostia have included in their plans community amenities such as day care centers, shuttle services, and recreation programs for resident children. Developments like Asheford Court, a new mixed-use, mixed-income community, will include a supermarket, restaurants, and shops. Even as they make communities more attractive, these amenities create new jobs and provide opportunities for small business development.Together with actors in the public and private sectors, leaders in the nonprofit community have an important role in the redevelopment of Anacostia as well, particularly in creating the social infrastructure that improves the quality of life. I have already alluded to Operation HOPE and the important work that it does in helping residents become more financially literate, which paves the way for more people to own homes and to start small businesses. Nonprofit community development organizations, such as East of the River Community Development Corporation, the Anacostia Economic Development Corporation, and the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization have supported retail development. With the support of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, over the past twenty years these organizations have worked to bring projects such as the Good Hope Marketplace and the future Shops at Park Village to the area. Guided by leaders who have a personal commitment to the success of their communities, these nonprofit organizations have led the way in meeting the needs of residents for affordable housing and in helping to attract private investment and development.Nonprofit educational and cultural organizations are also at the heart of this community\\'s revitalization. The network of nonprofits that worked together to create THEARC--the Washington Ballet, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Levine School of Music, and the Boys and Girls Club--is a model for strategic partnerships. THEARC also provides vital services, such as the Children\\'s Hospital family wellness center, a significant resource in a community that previously had no health-care facilities.Again, the development philosophy that we see at work in Anacostia is one that focuses not only on the construction of individual homes and businesses but on the broader social and economic environment in the community. As every successful developer knows, real estate markets are driven not only by the characteristics of the physical structures, though those are important, but also by the accessibility of goods and services that current and future residents want, such as schools, shops, and transportation.Beyond AnacostiaWhat does Anacostia\\'s experience offer for other communities confronting economic decline, given the reality of limited resources and the financial risks associated with redeveloping distressed areas? One lesson is that public, private, and nonprofit development partners must be increasingly innovative in their work. First, they must identify the strategic investments that have the potential to transform neighborhoods and stimulate ongoing private investment and economic activity. As I have noted today, success in community development requires a comprehensive approach--one based on the recognition that vibrant communities offer their residents not only a place to live, but also access to services, to community institutions, and to places to shop, work, and enjoy recreation as well. Many of the development initiatives that have taken place in Anacostia have made good use of this insight, combining housing development with other amenities such as recreational areas, retail outlets, or cultural institutions like THEARC.Second, the community leaders, government officials, lenders, and developers now involved in helping to rebuild communities must keep working to find new partners and new sources of capital. In this respect, it is encouraging to see how much more professional the whole field of community development finance has become. For example, over the past twenty-five years, innovative lenders at banks and at community development financial institutions have demonstrated that investments in community economic development can be rewarding in the financial sense as well as in the social sense. With that demonstration, new financing structures may continue to emerge that can help mitigate decreases in government funding. The expansion of secondary markets for affordable housing and community development loans will, I hope, provide increasing liquidity that allows the redeployment of capital for new development efforts. What we see today in Southeast D.C. demonstrates that smart public and private investment can create a virtuous circle of economic growth and opportunity. I am optimistic that the positive changes that we see in Anacostia can be replicated in economically challenged communities throughout the country.My optimism also stems from the commitment demonstrated by the participation today of leaders from all levels of government, banking, the corporate sector, and nonprofit institutions. Today\\'s summit underscores your commitment to increasing opportunity for lower-income individuals and communities. I join you in celebrating the ongoing revitalization of Anacostia and the potential for similar communities throughout our nation. I commend you for your leadership and look forward to your continued success.Footnotes Thank you for the invitation to speak today. I know we have a mix of bankers in the audience from institutions of all sizes that are engaged in asset/liability and treasury management. So I am going to discuss some issues that are relevant to banks of various types. First, I am going to comment on the proposed guidance for commercial real estate and nontraditional mortgages. Then, I want to discuss changing risk exposures in market risk and the related capital regulations. Finally, I will focus on recent regulatory actions that relate to small bank holding company capital and trust preferred securities.Proposed Supervisory GuidanceIt is my understanding that many of you are aware of proposed supervisory guidance relating to commercial real estate and nontraditional mortgages. We have received many comments on both proposals--perhaps even from some of you. Naturally, bankers may be somewhat concerned about the effect that this proposed guidance could have on their business. But I think it is helpful to remember that the primary responsibility of regulators is to ensure that the United States has a safe and sound banking system. When we see possibly excessive risk-taking or inappropriate risk management or controls, we must act. While most U.S. banks operate in a safe and sound manner, we must always be vigilant for problems that may arise in the future.Commercial Real EstateFirst, I would like to underscore that the proposed commercial real estate (CRE) guidance focuses on \"true\" CRE loans. It does not concern commercial loans for which a bank looks to a borrower\\'s cash flow as the source of repayment and accepts real estate collateral as a secondary source of repayment. Rather, it addresses bank lending on commercial real estate projects for which repayment is dependent on third-party rental income or the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. With \"true\" commercial real estate lending, repayment depends on the condition and performance of the real estate market.I would also like to mention up front that the proposed guidance is not intended to cap or restrict banks\\' participation in the commercial real estate sector, but rather to remind institutions that proper risk management and adequate capital are essential components of a sound CRE lending strategy. In fact, both of these components are already in place at many institutions. No element of the proposed guidance is intended to act as a \"trigger\" or \"hard limit\" signaling the need for an immediate cutback in or reversal of CRE lending; rather, the thresholds in the proposed guidance are intended as benchmarks identifying cases for further review.Supervisors focus on commercial real estate because that sector played a central role in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s and has historically been a highly volatile asset class. Past problems in the sector have generally come at times when the broader market encountered difficulties. Therefore, banks should not be surprised by the emphasis of the proposed guidance on the importance of portfolio risk management and concentrations. One reason supervisors are proposing CRE guidance at this point is that we are seeing high and rising concentrations of CRE loans relative to capital. For certain groups of banks, such as those with assets between $100 million and $1 billion, average CRE concentrations are about 300 percent of total capital. This is twice the concentration level of about 150 percent in the late 1980s and early 1990s for this same bank group, when we last went through the bottom of a CRE credit cycle.While banks\\' underwriting standards are generally stronger now than in the 1980s and 1990s, the agencies are proposing the guidance now to reinforce sound portfolio-management principles that a bank should have in place when pursuing a commercial real estate lending strategy. In addition to monitoring the performance of individual loans, bankers should also be monitoring the mix of property types and performance of their portfolio as a whole and the performance of local real estate markets in which they are lending. A bank targeting commercial real estate lending as a primary business activity needs to consider that the risk exposure arising from the performance of its total CRE loan portfolio--the concentration risk--depends on broader real estate market conditions. For example, if a bank has several borrowers with similar projects that encounter problems--such as longer absorption periods, higher marketing costs, or higher vacancy rates--weaknesses in the broader real estate market can have a cascading effect on the quality of the bank\\'s CRE portfolio as real estate values erode.In evaluating the impact of their commercial real estate concentrations, bankers should also pay attention to geographic factors. A bank may lend successfully within a certain geographic area but may encounter problems when it begins to lend outside its market, or \"footprint,\" for which it typically has better market intelligence. In recent years, supervisors have observed banks, in order to maintain a customer relationship, going beyond their established footprint and lending in real estate markets with which they have less experience. The challenge can be even greater when the borrower is also venturing into a new market. In prior CRE credit downturns, such practices have led to significant losses.Nontraditional Mortgage ProductsOver the past few years, the agencies have observed an increase in the number of residential mortgage loans that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and, sometimes, interest. These loans, often referred to as nontraditional mortgage loans, include \"interest-only\" (IO) mortgage loans, on which the borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years of the loan, and \"payment-option\" adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), for which the borrower has flexible payment options--and which could also result in negative amortization.IOs and option ARMs are estimated to have accounted for almost one-third of all U.S. mortgage originations in 2005, compared with less than 10 percent in 2003. Despite their recent growth, however, these products, it is estimated, still account for less than 20 percent of aggregate domestic mortgages outstanding of $8 trillion. While the credit quality of residential mortgages generally remains strong, the Federal Reserve and other banking supervisors are concerned that current risk-management techniques may not fully address the level of risk inherent in nontraditional mortgages, a risk that would be heightened by a downturn in the housing market.Mortgages with some of the characteristics of nontraditional mortgage products have been available for many years; however, they have historically been offered to higher-income borrowers. More recently, they have been offered to a wider spectrum of consumers, including subprime borrowers, who may be less suited for these types of mortgages and may not fully recognize the embedded risks. These borrowers are more likely to experience an unmanageable payment shock during the life of the loan, meaning that they may be more likely to default on the loan. Further, nontraditional mortgage loans are becoming more prevalent in the subprime market at the same time risk tolerances in the capital markets have increased. Banks need to be prepared for the resulting impact on liquidity and pricing if and when risk spreads return to more \"normal\" levels and competition in the mortgage banking industry intensifies.Supervisors have also observed that lenders are increasingly combining nontraditional mortgage loans with weaker mitigating controls on credit exposures--for example, by accepting less documentation in evaluating an applicant\\'s creditworthiness and not evaluating the borrower\\'s ability to meet increasing monthly payments when amortization begins or when interest rates rise. These \"risk layering\" practices have become more and more prevalent in mortgage originations. Thus, while some banks may have used elements of the product structure successfully in the past, the easing of traditional underwriting controls and sales of products to subprime borrowers may have unforeseen effects on losses realized in these products.In view of these industry trends, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies decided to issue the draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products. The proposed guidance emphasizes that an institution\\'s risk-management processes should allow it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products. It reminds lenders of the importance of assessing a borrower\\'s ability to repay the loan including when amortization begins and interest rates rise. These products warrant strong risk-management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan-loss reserves. Further, bankers should consider the impact of prepayment penalties for ARMs. Lenders should provide borrowers with enough information to clearly understand, before choosing a product or payment option, the terms of and risks associated with these loans, particularly the extent to which monthly payments may rise and that negative amortization may increase the amount owed above the amount originally borrowed. Lenders should recognize that certain nontraditional mortgage loans are untested in a stressed environment; for instance, nontraditional mortgage loans to investors that rely on collateral values could be particularly affected by a housing price decline. Investors have represented an unusually large share of home purchases in the last two years. Past loan performance indicated that investors are more likely to default on a loan when housing prices decline, than owner occupants.Ongoing Efforts to Update and Improve the Market Risk AmendmentLet me now describe the changes that are occurring in market risk capital. While only banks with large trading books hold capital for market risk, the issues that the proposed changes are designed to address can be considered by treasurers, asset/liability managers, and traders to determine whether their risk management practices are keeping pace with the changing nature of risks.As you are no doubt aware, about a decade ago the U.S. banking agencies developed regulatory capital requirements specifically for market risk. These requirements, set forth in the Market Risk Amendment (MRA) to the Basel Capital Accord, were an attempt to keep up with the financial innovation that was occurring in the industry. The Basel MRA is only applied to banks with sizable market risk exposures. The U.S. banking agencies adopted the internal models approach to capturing the market risk arising from traded exposures. The internal models approach, which is the only one offered in the United States, is based on the widely used value-at-risk (VaR) methodology with a uniform ten-day holding period and a 99 percent confidence interval. At the time the Market Risk Amendment was adopted, the soundness standard set forth in the internal models approach worked well for the traded positions of a large number of banks. However, even then, banks and supervisors recognized that certain risks, such as fat tails and model risks, were not well captured in VaR models. Supervisors were led to impose a multiplier of 3 on internally modeled estimates of general market risk and a multiplier of 4 on internally modeled estimates of specific market risk that do not adequately capture event and default risk.Since adoption of the Market Risk Amendment, banks\\' trading activities have become more sophisticated and have given rise to a wider range of risks that are not easily captured in a VaR model. For example, more products related to credit risk, such as credit default swaps and tranches of collateralized debt obligations, are now included in the trading book. These products can give rise to default risks that are not captured well in models specifying a ten-day holding period and a 99 percent confidence interval, particularly if the bank has concentrations across various trading portfolios, such as bonds, credit derivatives, and other structured credit products. In addition, structured and exotic traded products may give rise to liquidity, correlation, concentration, and skew risks, which are difficult to capture adequately in a VaR model. The inability of VaR calculations to adequately measure the risks of certain traded positions may give rise to arbitrage opportunities between the banking book and the trading book because of the lower capital charge that may be afforded trading positions under a VaR approach that is not optimally risk sensitive.The U.S. banking agencies are in the process of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the Basel-IOSCO market risk revisions in this country. We expect that the current market risk revisions, like the current U.S. rules implementing the MRA for U.S. banking organizations, will apply only to banking organizations meeting the current threshold criteria for application of the market risk rules--that is, to those organizations having aggregate trading assets and liabilities, as reported on the Call Report, of (1) 10 percent or more of total assets or (2) $1 billion or more. These revised market risk amendments would be applied by banking organizations meeting either criterion, whether or not the organization is adopting the credit and operational portions of the Basel II framework. We expect that a small number of banking organizations will remain under the Basel I rules (as amended) but will also compute a market risk charge. Banking organizations that do not meet one of the criteria would not be subject to a market risk capital charge, regardless of whether they apply the Basel I or Basel II rules for credit and operational risk. This expectation is consistent with our view--since the inception of the market risk rules--that imposing the burden of calculating a market risk capital charge is not appropriate when market risk exposure does not meet the threshold criteria.These Pillar 1 revisions in the area of market risk are supplemented and supported by revisions in the areas of supervisory review (Pillar 2) and market discipline (Pillar 3), just as are the revisions for credit risk and operational risk. The Pillar 2 changes seek to strengthen firms\\' assessments of their internal capital adequacy in the area of market risk, taking into account the output of their VaR models, valuation adjustments, and stress tests. Internal capital assessments must factor in: illiquidity; concentrated positions; nonlinear and deep out-of-the-money products; events and jumps-to-default; and significant shifts in correlations. The Pillar 3 changes increase the robustness of trading book disclosures; specifically, firms must demonstrate how they combine their risk measurement approaches to arrive at an overall internal capital assessment. We expect to issue this NPR sometime this summer.Innovations in Capital InstrumentsNaturally, in determining capital adequacy ratios, supervisors focus not just on defining risk positions--the denominator--but also on defining the components of capital--the numerator. Over the years there have been a number of innovations in capital instruments; one particularly innovative area has been the structuring of preferred stock and hybrid securities for inclusion in tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve refined its framework for the components of tier 1 capital in a final rule issued in March 2005. The final rule allows bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital, much of which they invest in the common stock of their depository institution subsidiaries. However, the final rule also imposes stricter quantitative limits and qualitative standards on trust preferred securities and on other restricted core capital elements included in tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve\\'s goal in framing the final rule was to allow innovation and adaptation in capital funding for bank holding companies--much of which are aimed at increased cost effectiveness--while ensuring consistency with the Federal Reserve\\'s focus on the quality and strength of institutions\\' capital bases. To this end, the final rule states that common stock and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock should make up no less than three quarters of a banking organization\\'s tier 1 capital. We believe that the continued strength of the capital base of U.S. bank holding companies is a critical component of the safety and soundness of the industry we supervise.The Federal Reserve considers many factors when it evaluates eligible capital for BHCs, especially for innovative capital instruments. Thus, our decision to allow BHCs to continue to include trust preferred stock in tier 1 capital came only with stricter quantitative standards that apply to a range of non-common equity capital elements. In our view, the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital is merited because our experience has shown that this instrument can provide financial support to banking organizations if their financial condition deteriorates. Also, from a competitive point of view, poolings of trust preferred stock have enabled smaller BHCs to enter the capital markets for tier 1 capital, which larger BHCs have long been able to access.A recent innovation that banking organizations have been considering is a modified trust preferred security that continues to receive tier 1 capital treatment but is given increased equity credit from the rating agencies. Although the Federal Reserve is working with institutions on possible modifications to conventional trust preferred securities that meet this objective, our focus is on ensuring that the instruments continue to provide capital strength and do not give rise to supervisory problems. Our experience with conventional trust preferred securities has been largely positive, and we hope to maintain that track record with any modified trust preferred securities we eventually approve. Thus, while we are cognizant that a large volume of trust preferred securities will begin to become callable at the end of this year, making institutions especially keen to find a replacement security with higher rating-agency equity credit, we intend to move judiciously in approving modifications. As always, we will do our best to respond to the business needs of the banking organizations we supervise in a timely manner and to accommodate them to the extent possible within the bounds of our prudential framework.Changes to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy StatementFinally, knowing that many of you represent smaller banks, I want to highlight a recent change in the Federal Reserve\\'s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. That statement was originally issued in 1980 to facilitate the transfer of ownership of small community-based banks in a safe and sound manner. It permits the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies (BHCs) that have debt levels higher than would be permitted for larger BHCs. The statement previously applied to those BHCs (qualifying small BHCs) that had pro forma consolidated assets of less than $150 million and met certain qualitative criteria.The Federal Reserve follows the general principle that bank holding companies should be a source of strength for their subsidiary banks. When a bank holding company incurs debt and relies on the earnings of its subsidiary banks to repay the debt, the probable effect on the financial condition of the holding company and its subsidiary bank or banks becomes a concern. The Federal Reserve believes that a high level of debt at the parent holding company level can impair the BHC\\'s ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank or banks; in some cases, the servicing requirements on such debt may be a significant drain on the bank\\'s resources. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve recognizes the need for flexibility in the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies that have debt levels higher than would be permitted for larger bank holding companies. Notably, approval of the higher debt levels has been given on the condition that the small bank holding companies demonstrate the ability to service debt without straining the capital of their subsidiary banks and, further, that the companies restore their ability to serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary bank within a relatively short period.In September 2005, the Federal Reserve requested comment on proposed amendments to the rule. After reviewing the comments on the proposal, the Federal Reserve in February 2006 approved a final rule very similar to the proposal. The final rule raised the small BHC asset size threshold from $150 million to $500 million for determining whether a small BHC would be eligible for the Policy Statement and exempt from the Capital Guidelines. The Federal Reserve also adopted several modifications to the qualitative criteria under which a BHC not exceeding the asset size threshold nevertheless would be ineligible for application of the Policy Statement and would be subject to the Capital Guidelines. These modifications were intended to ensure that factors related to safety and soundness, not just to size, are also taken into account. The final rule also clarified that subordinated debt associated with issuances of trust preferred securities generally would be considered debt for most purposes under the Policy Statement, but provided a five-year transition period for subordinated debt issued before the date of the proposed rule.The new threshold and amended qualitative criteria are designed to reflect changes in the industry since the Policy Statement was first issued in 1980. With respect to the amended qualitative criteria, the final rule excludes from Policy Statement eligibility any small BHC that is engaged in significant nonbanking activities; is engaged in significant off-balance sheet activities, including securitizations or assets under management; or has a material amount of debt registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or equity securities outstanding. Federal Reserve staff expect that relatively few small BHCs will be excluded under these criteria.Whereas the treatment of subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities was not previously defined, the final rule clarifies that such subordinated debt is considered debt for most purposes under the Policy Statement. It provides for a five-year transition period, however, to give qualifying small BHCs sufficient time to conform their debt structures. The rule also allows small BHCs to refinance existing issuances of trust preferred securities without losing the exempt status of the related subordinated debt during the transition period, so long as the amount of the BHC\\'s subordinated debt does not increase in the aggregate.Finally, the notice informs the public that the Federal Reserve expects to review the asset threshold at least once every five years to determine whether further adjustments might be appropriate.ConclusionThe Federal Reserve believes that ensuring strong capital levels and good risk management at U.S. banking organizations is critical to the health of our banking and financial system. Our regulatory and supervisory efforts support this broad objective. That is why we provide guidance around emerging risk issues, such as the current proposals for commercial real estate and nontraditional mortgages. We also work to make sure innovations in financial instruments are encouraged and used in appropriate risk-management frameworks, and we periodically will change regulatory policy to support sound risk management. At the end of the day, it is our job as bank supervisor and central bank to ensure that banks are operating in a safe and sound manner, and that financial stability is maintained.Thank you.Footnotes The check-processing system is also evolving rapidly. The changing character of the payments business is challenging long-held assumptions about the payments infrastructure, as well as business relationships in the payments industry. My remarks today, which reflect my own thoughts and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board, will provide an overview of some of the recent changes in retail payments, the challenges of innovation, and the Federal Reserve’s role in the retail payments system.Changes in the Retail Payments SystemFor many reasons, I believe the pace of change we have experienced in the retail payments system over this past decade will continue or even accelerate. Much of the needed electronic infrastructure is in place today, both in homes and at businesses. As new generations grow up in the PC age and as older generations become increasingly computer literate, people are becoming more comfortable with using electronic technology in their daily lives. At the same time, the emergence of interstate banking has removed institutional barriers to the development of national electronic debit systems. Innovation in payments systems has also become a global phenomenon, and successful innovations outside the United States will likely influence developments here. These and other factors will likely spur further changes in our payments system in the years to come.New technologies are at the heart of this evolution. Laws, regulations, and rules have also been modified to remove barriers to innovation and experimentation in the payments system. These factors are driving the changes we see today. Consumers and businesses are increasingly using debit and credit cards instead of paper checks and cash at the point of sale, and technology has allowed the payments industry to develop new payment instruments to meet new business needs. For example, over the past decade, Internet-based payment options, such as PayPal, have grown rapidly and facilitated commerce on the web. In addition, closed-network, prepaid payment alternatives, which use chip-based technology, have been successful in collecting tolls on the nation’s highways.Likewise, the combination of new technologies and changes to the rules and regulations governing the ACH network has facilitated the use of this network for one-time, nonrecurring payments. In the past, the ACH was mainly used for recurring payments, such as payroll, mortgage, and utility payments. Today, consumer purchases at stores, over the telephone, or over the Internet can be completed using the ACH. Regulatory changes have also facilitated the use of the ACH to convert checks that consumers mail to businesses into electronic payments. These new uses of the ACH for one-time payments have driven continuing double-digit growth rates of ACH transaction volume.Legal and technological changes are also affecting how banks process checks. For example, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, or Check 21, has facilitated the ability of banks to collect checks electronically. Depository institutions are using the authority granted under Check 21 to apply communications and imaging technologies to long-established check-collection processes. Ultimately, these changes will not only reduce check-processing and transportation costs but also diminish the importance of geography in check processing. However, banks seeking to implement a full end-to-end electronic check-processing environment must reengineer their back-office systems to integrate the more complex aspects of electronic check receipt into their core banking and risk-management systems. We are beginning to see evidence that depository institutions are starting this reengineering process. Generally, Check 21 volumes at the Reserve Banks are increasing rapidly, reflecting the efficiency gains that will inexorably lead to the electronic processing of almost all checks in the not-too-distant future.The greater use of electronic payments has not been uniform across all market segments. A closer look at payment trends reveals that consumers and businesses may have different perspectives on electronic payments. Businesses have been encouraging consumers to use electronic payment alternatives and have been the driving force behind the conversion of consumer checks into ACH payments. In turn, consumers, recognizing the convenience of electronic payments, have allowed their checks to be converted into ACH payments and have initiated an increasing number of their payments electronically.Businesses, on the other hand, have been more cautious about having their own checks converted into ACH payments or switching from paper to electronics. There are some obvious reasons for this behavior. First, businesses often have cash-management processes or legacy accounting systems in place that rely on paper checks. A payments conference hosted by the Federal Reserve in 2003 found that businesses face organizational and technical challenges in moving to electronics. For example, businesses may need to make significant investments in their back-office payment, billing, and accounting systems before they can use electronic payments more frequently. In addition, many businesses are reluctant, from a control perspective, to allow others to debit funds electronically from their accounts. If businesses can overcome these challenges, they should be able to make and receive a much larger portion of their payments electronically. At the same time, the financial incentives for businesses to make these changes will increase as the relative costs of electronic versus paper payments continue to shift in favor of electronic payments.Challenges of Payment System InnovationIn addition to low costs, successful innovations must satisfy at least three criteria: meet end-user needs, address network externalities, and provide sufficient controls over risks. To be successful, new payment instruments, and changes to existing instruments, must ultimately be more convenient and cost-effective for end users. Consumers and businesses are not likely to modify their payment behavior unless they are shown how they will benefit from a change. A Federal Reserve Board staff study conducted in 2002, “The Future of Retail Electronic Payments Systems,” highlighted this observation. The study was based on interviews with payment system innovators, many of whom had experience during the years of the Internet boom. The interviews emphasized that providers of payment services cannot assume that an innovative service will generate significant demand simply because it provides new and creative technical capabilities. Providing net benefits to one or more key participants in a transaction, while not materially affecting other participants negatively, appears to be the most important requirement for any innovation to be successful. The benefits may accrue to the providers of payment services in the form of lower costs, but they cannot adversely affect end users. This interaction between the preferences of payments users and the choices offered by payments providers determines which payment instruments will become successful in the long run.Successful electronic payment instruments, by their very nature, require large networks with wide reach. That is, the instruments require a critical mass of both payers and payees. Developing large networks and attaining critical mass, however, are often difficult tasks. Consumers may be cautious about using new payment methods and will have particular concerns about how providers protect users’ funds, security, and privacy. In complex payment systems, users may need a significant amount of time to become familiar with and learn to trust a new system. Moreover, potential providers of new payment services may be cautious about investing before they understand how many consumers would want to use a new payment instrument or system. As a result, innovators face the classic “chicken and egg” problem when assessing the network economics of establishing new systems. In the late 1990s, attempts to establish large-scale stored-value card networks in the United States faced these problems and were ultimately not successful.However, the likelihood of overcoming these network problems appears to be higher if a particular innovation meets a significant need that existing instruments do not. For example, the growth of Internet commerce created a new need for a payment method that would allow both consumers and businesses to make and receive relatively low-value electronic payments. While credit cards and debit cards have become the primary means of conducting these transactions, a segment of the market, specifically individuals and small businesses, could not readily accept card payments from others. This demand for an alternative way to make payments on the Internet eventually led to the development of new payment options, such as PayPal.The economics of networks and of scale may also interact and accelerate change in traditional systems. For example, the clearing system for paper checks includes a high-fixed-cost physical transportation system. Declines in check volumes generally, as well as declines in the collection of checks in paper form, will likely result in higher unit costs to collect paper checks, as the fixed costs of the network are spread over ever-decreasing volumes. The increases in unit costs, in turn, will cause banks to examine less expensive electronic processing alternatives, as check-collection intermediaries raise prices to recover their costs. As a result, market dynamics will continue to lead to the greater use of electronic check processing.Managing risk is also critical to successful payments innovation. These risks include fraud, operational, financial, and legal risks. Understanding the relationship between innovation and risk is particularly important in today’s evolving payment system because concerns about risk can inhibit the adoption of innovative payment products and services. Payment innovations can potentially reduce risk within a payment system, but in a complex environment, innovation may also shift risks or even increase them. Both the design of payments systems and the way participants use them can affect risk. For example, because a depository institution’s ACH and check systems may not be integrated, stop payments on checks may not work as intended, thereby increasing the risk that fraud may slip through the system. Innovations in the use of payment networks, such as the ACH, have led to greater complexity in roles and responsibilities. Both depository institutions and ACH operators are actively examining their risk-management capabilities to determine whether new risks resulting from innovation are being adequately managed. The use of Check 21 authority to process checks has altered operational, legal, and fraud risks, which has led depository institutions to reexamine and, as necessary, modify their processes and procedures to ensure that these risks continue to be well managed.In this time of transition in the payment system, both providers and users of payments systems will need to manage their risks more comprehensively. Traditionally, risk has been managed with a segmented, payment-specific approach. This made sense when payments systems were largely independent of one another. Today, the conversion of checks to electronic payments, as well as the technical integration of electronic networks and systems, requires providers and users to adopt a more strategic approach to managing products, infrastructure, and risk across traditional payments silos. They need to consider not only the financial and business cases for adopting a particular payments strategy but also how the risks associated with the strategy will be managed. The payments industry has been actively discussing this issue, and I expect that the industry will develop effective and comprehensive risk-management approaches.The Federal Reserve’s Role in the Payments SystemThe Federal Reserve will continue to play an important role in fostering a smoothly functioning payments system that is safe, efficient, and accessible. We also need to be flexible in carrying out our traditional functions within the payments system--as a provider of payment services, regulator, and catalyst for change--in this rapidly changing environment.In its role as service provider, the Federal Reserve will continue to promote the efficiency of the nation’s payments system. The Reserve Banks are now pricing their check services to encourage the greater use of electronic check products relative to paper check products. The Reserve Banks are also leaders in providing Check 21 services to encourage depository institutions to shift to the greater use of electronics in check processing and have been working collaboratively with the industry on electronic check standards and other technical issues. Most importantly, the Reserve Banks will continue to compete as payment services providers on a fair and equitable basis by pricing their services to recover their costs, including imputed profits and taxes, as required by the Monetary Control Act of 1980.In its role as a regulator, the Federal Reserve will need to be alert to the application of regulations in changing circumstances. In some cases, regulations may impede the ability of service providers and consumers to take advantage of new technology. For example, the Federal Reserve has clarified the application of Regulation E to the new ACH services I discussed earlier involving check conversions. In some other cases, payments innovations can expose consumers to new risks--risks with which they may not be familiar. In addressing these situations, the Federal Reserve must ensure that consumers have adequate protection and that regulations are consistent with the changing technological environment. Changing payment practices can also expose financial institutions to growing risks. Last year, for example, the Federal Reserve modified its Regulation CC to reallocate the liability for unauthorized, remotely created checks among depository institutions, shifting liability to institutions that are better positioned to influence and mitigate those risks.Finally, in its role as a catalyst for change, the Federal Reserve will work with the private sector to identify and, when appropriate, address barriers to payments system innovation. Last month, the Federal Reserve combined the duties of two of its internal committees that deal with payments issues. The newly expanded Payments System Policy Advisory Committee will provide the Federal Reserve with an overall view of strategic developments in both wholesale and retail payment systems. In addition to supporting sound policy development, the committee will sponsor research on payments issues that will help inform policymakers, the industry, and the public. We will also promote dialogue with a wide range of participants in the retail and wholesale payments systems to better understand a variety of perspectives on key issues. We will continue to sponsor different types of forums as an important part of our public outreach activities.ConclusionDespite the many challenges associated with the rapid evolution I have discussed today, the United States continues to enjoy a safe, efficient, and reliable payment system. The strength of its financial institutions, as well as its payments and settlement systems, are the bedrock of the country’s financial infrastructure. As innovations occur in the payments system, market forces will determine which of these innovations will ultimately best serve the needs of consumers and businesses. We, at the Federal Reserve, need to continue to address barriers to innovation to give the private sector scope to experiment with new payment services, while we continue to fulfill our responsibilities to foster a robust payments system that protects and benefits its participants. At this time of strategic change, I believe that dialogue among payments system participants and users will help all of us identify and address issues of innovation and risk in a balanced and thoughtful manner. This conference is a welcome and constructive element in this important dialogue.Footnotes Thank you for the invitation to speak here today. I am honored to be with this distinguished group of risk-management professionals from around the world. In my remarks, I will focus primarily on the choices and challenges associated with Basel II implementation. In particular, I want to reaffirm the Federal Reserve’s commitment to Basel II and the need for continual evolution in risk measurement and management at our largest banks and then discuss a few key aspects of Basel II implementation in the United States. Given the international audience here today, I also plan to offer some thoughts on cross-border implementation issues associated with Basel II, including so-called home-host issues.Rationale for Moving to Basel IIThe current Basel I capital framework, adopted nearly twenty years ago, has served us well but has become increasingly inadequate for large, internationally active banks that are offering ever more complex and sophisticated products and services. We need a better capital framework for these large, internationally active banks, and we believe that Basel II is such a framework.One of the major improvements in Basel II is the closer link between capital requirements and the way banks manage their actual risk. The current Basel I measures have very limited risk-sensitivity and do not provide bankers, supervisors, or the marketplace with meaningful measures of risk at large complex organizations. Under Basel I, a bank’s capital requirement does not adequately reflect gradations in asset quality and does not change over time to reflect deterioration in asset quality. Further, there is no explicit capital requirement for the operational risk embedded in many of the services from which the largest institutions generate a good portion of their revenues.In addition to strengthening the link between regulatory capital and the way banks manage their actual capital, Basel II should make the financial system safer by encouraging continual improvement in risk-measurement and risk-management practices at the largest banks. Basel II is based on many of the economic capital principles used by the most sophisticated banks and therefore brings minimum regulatory capital requirements closer to banks’ internal capital models. By providing a consistent framework for the largest banks to use, supervisors will more readily be able to identify portfolios and banks whose capital is not commensurate with their risk levels. Through ongoing and regular dialogue, this process will in turn help management to be better informed about how their proprietary models compare to the range of practices currently in use so they can better prioritize where enhancements are needed. We have already seen some progress in risk measurement and management at many institutions in the United States and around the globe as a result of preparations for Basel II. Admittedly, banks have told us that some of the costs for Basel II would have been incurred anyway. But if anything, Basel II has accelerated the pace of this change.Basel II can also provide supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for evaluating systemic risk in the banking system through credit cycles. Thus it improves on Basel I, which requires banks to hold the same level of capital for a given portfolio, no matter what its inherent risk may be. Further, as bankers gain experience with the advanced approaches under Basel II, they will have better information on how their risk taking may vary through credit cycles. Therefore, Basel II establishes a more coherent relationship between how supervisors assess regulatory capital and how they supervise banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent capital levels, given their risk profiles.The reasons I’ve just given for pursuing Basel II also provide justification for the recent Basel revisions to the 1996 Market Risk Amendment (MRA). Since adoption of the MRA, banks’ trading activities have become more sophisticated and have given rise to a wider range of risks that are not easily captured in their existing value-at-risk (VaR) models. For example, more products related to credit risk, such as credit default swaps and tranches of collateralized debt obligations, are now included in the trading book. These products can give rise to default risks that are not captured well in methodologies required by the current rule specifying a ten-day holding period and a 99 percent confidence interval. The inability of VaR calculations to adequately measure the risks of certain traded positions may give rise to arbitrage opportunities between the banking book and the trading book because of the lower capital charge that may be afforded trading positions under a VaR approach that is not optimally risk-sensitive. The U.S. banking agencies are in the process of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the market risk revisions in the United States. These revisions will apply to those banks with significant trading activity, regardless of their Basel II status.Bridging the Gap between Regulatory Capital Requirements and Internal Bank PracticeWith Basel II, U.S. supervisors are attempting to use the internal risk-measurement and -management information produced by large complex institutions to manage their own risks in such a way as to augment the risk sensitivity and overall meaningfulness of minimum regulatory capital measures. Basel II, by tying regulatory capital calculations to bank-generated inputs, offers greater transparency about risk-measurement and management practices that stand behind the inputs provided by banks and exactly how they are calculated. Supervisors, through their analysis of bank inputs to Basel II, will develop an even better assessment of institutions’ risk-measurement and risk-management practices. Furthermore, the added transparency in Pillar 3 disclosures is expected to give market participants a better understanding of an institution’s risks and its ability to manage them.Of course, we understand that the extent that internal inputs from bankers can be used in regulatory capital requirements is limited, for a variety of reasons. Today’s banks have highly customized models for running their businesses, which of course is entirely appropriate. But, as supervisors, we need to ensure adequacy and enforceability of our minimum regulatory requirements and maintain some consistency across banks. Naturally, as we seek to develop a common framework that will work for large complex banks globally, we recognize an inherent tension between our regulatory rules and internal bank practice. We are working to strike the right balance to achieve our goals without making Basel II purely a compliance exercise and creating undue burden.Need for Strong CapitalBasel II is intended to improve regulatory capital requirements, especially for large complex organizations, through greater risk sensitivity of regulatory capital and improved linkage to banks’ actual capital risk management. That is why we have chosen to adopt only the most advanced options for credit risk and operational risk minimum regulatory capital calculations in the United States, and to limit the requirement of Basel II to only a small number of banking institutions that fit the definition of large, complex, and internationally active. It is also important to recognize that Basel II is a complete capital framework consisting of three pillars. While much of the focus to date has been on the calculation of minimum regulatory capital in Pillar I, it should be remembered that Pillar 2, which provides for supervisory oversight of an institution’s overall capital adequacy, and Pillar 3, which requires enhanced transparency via disclosure, are also important parts of this new framework.Let me assure you that we at the Federal Reserve would not be pursuing Basel II if we thought that it would in any way undermine the strong capital base that U.S. institutions now have. As a central bank and a supervisor of banks, bank holdings companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital for our largest and most complex banking institutions. That is why we supported moving ahead with the NPR, which includes modifications to address concerns identified in the fourth quantitative impact study, known as QIS4, and additional safeguards to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to Basel II. We will remain vigilant in monitoring and assessing Basel II’s impact on individual and aggregate minimum regulatory capital levels on an ongoing basis. As an extra degree of precaution, the U.S. banking agencies also decided to delay for a year the start of the parallel-run period.Starting with the parallel run, and both during and after the transition to Basel II, the Federal Reserve will rely upon ongoing, detailed analyses to evaluate the results of the new framework to ensure prudent levels of capital. Basel II represents a major shift in how we think about regulatory capital, especially as we will implement it in the United States. It is complex, reflecting the complexity of risk measurement and management for the largest, most complex banking institutions, and the banking institutions and the supervisors will need to have ongoing dialogue and work diligently to make sure it is working as we expect it to. But we believe it is a powerful approach to making regulatory capital more risk-sensitive. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve believes that strong capital is critical to the health of our banking system, and we believe that Basel II will help us continue to ensure that U.S. banks maintain capital levels that serve as an appropriate cushion against their risk-taking.Some Aspects of U.S. ProposalsAs you know, the draft U.S. Basel II NPR is based on the 2004 framework issued by the Basel Committee and adheres to the main elements of that framework. But the U.S. agencies have exercised national discretion and tailored the Basel II framework to fit the U.S. banking system and U.S. financial environment, as have their counterparts in other countries. For example, as I have just mentioned, the U.S. agencies continue to propose that we implement only the advanced approaches of Basel II, namely the advanced internal-ratings-based approach (AIRB) for credit risk and the advanced measurement approaches (AMA) for operational risk.The U.S. agencies also included in the NPR a more gradual timetable and a more rigorous set of transition safeguards than those set forth in the 2004 Basel II framework. For instance, the U.S. agencies are proposing three years of transition floors below which minimum required capital under Basel II will not be permitted to fall, relative to the general risk-based capital rules. The first transition year would have a floor of 95 percent, the second 90 percent, and the third 85 percent. Part of the justification for implementing a more gradual transition timetable was the recognition that banks needed more time to prepare and we as supervisors needed more time to analyze transition information and ensure there would be no unintended consequences.As you are aware, the QIS4 exercise identified some areas requiring further clarification by regulators and additional work by bankers on risk models and databases. One of the key areas in the NPR influenced by these results pertains to banks’ estimates of loss given default (LGD). Many QIS4 participants had difficulty computing LGDs, which must reflect downturn conditions, in part because their data histories were not long enough to capture weaker parts of the economic cycle. As a result, the agencies have proposed a supervisory mapping function that can be used by those institutions unable to estimate appropriate LGDs. The mapping function allows an institution to take its average LGDs and “stress” them to generate an input to the capital calculation that conforms to the Basel II requirements and hence produces a more appropriate capital requirement. The Federal Reserve believes this supervisory mapping function is an important component of Basel II because the QIS4 results showed the difficulty some banks are likely to have in producing acceptable internal estimates of LGD that are sufficient for risk-based capital purposes. The bank will shift from use of the mapping function to its own internal estimates of LGDs when they become reliable.Another key area in the U.S. Basel II proposals relates to regulatory reporting and data requirements. The agencies expect to issue information about this aspect of our proposals soon, so I will offer only a few general thoughts here.As you know, risk managers need to be able to discern whether fluctuations in risk exposures and capital are due to external effects, such as changes in the economy and the point in the economic cycle where decisions are being made, or are more related to their individual business decisions, including product characteristics, customer mix and underwriting criteria. We will continue to expect bankers to anticipate the effects of such economic fluctuations and business decisions, not just analyze them after the fact. As we move toward greater risk sensitivity in our regulatory capital framework, and greater alignment with what banks are doing internally to manage risk, the way in which we as supervisors assess the adequacy of capital levels must consider the sources of these fluctuations more than ever before. This requires both bankers and supervisors to place a greater emphasis on high-quality data and sound analysis. For example, data should contain enhanced look-back capabilities, so that we and bankers will be able to assess fluctuations within an institution over time. Unfortunately, in our QIS4 analysis we were unable to decompose changes we observed into those attributable to the economic cycle and those attributable to a bank’s individual portfolio composition because the QIS4 data were collected at a single point in time. Even comparisons of QIS4 information to previously collected QIS3 data were limited because there was no direct link between the two data samples. As part of the move toward greater risk sensitivity, and noting that different institutions have different risk profiles, we expect to place increased emphasis on sound economic analysis that focuses on changes observed at a single institution over time, as well as more traditional analysis across institutions.Basel I ModificationsAt this point I would like to say just a few words about ongoing efforts to revise existing Basel I regulatory capital rules for non-Basel II institutions. We expect only one or two dozen banks to move to the U.S. version of Basel II in the near term, meaning that the vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating under Basel I, which will be amended through a separate rulemaking process. The Basel I framework has already been amended more than twenty-five times in response to changes in banking products and the banking environment and as a result of a better understanding of the risks of individual products and services. The U.S. agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules. The U.S. agencies have issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking discussing possible changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules and to mitigate potential competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II. We are now in the process of reviewing the comments and working on a draft notice of proposed rulemaking. We are mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the large number of banks to which the revised rules will apply.With regard to both Basel II proposals and proposed Basel I amendments, we understand the need for full transparency. For that reason, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for both the Basel II NPR and the NPR for the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping timeframes. Accordingly, our proposals could change as a result of comments received or new information gathered by the U.S. agencies.Cross-Border Implementation of Basel IIAs I noted earlier, each country must implement Basel II as appropriate for the particular jurisdiction. To that end, the U.S. agencies are taking actions to ensure that implementation in the United States is conducted in a prudential manner and without generating competitive inequalities in our banking sector. We recognize that the differing approaches to Basel II that are being adopted by various countries may create challenges for banking organizations that operate in multiple jurisdictions. It is good to remember that cross-border banking has always raised specific challenges that supervisors from various countries have worked hard to address. Let me assure all bankers here that supervisors are aware that the process of change to new national versions of Basel II has heightened concerns about home-host issues. The Federal Reserve and other U.S. agencies have, for many years, worked with international counterparts to limit the difficulty and burden that have arisen as foreign banks have entered U.S. markets and as U.S. banks have established operations in other jurisdictions.The U.S. is working to complete its national standard setting process since we recognize that the lack of a final rule raises uncertainty for both banks and foreign supervisors about exactly what will be required. As you are aware, the Accord Implementation Group has been working for the past few years identifying issues arising from differences in national standards of the Basel II framework. All of the supervisory bodies participating in that effort are committed to making the transition to Basel II successful.We have heard from bankers that they are concerned about home-host issues. The U.S. banking agencies all encourage regular meetings between bankers and supervisors. These meetings provide a forum for bankers to make supervisors aware of implementation plans and progress at individual banks, and for supervisors to make bankers aware of current supervisory expectations. They also provide bankers opportunities to raise specific implementation issues. Of course, all Basel-member countries have their own rollout timelines and their own ways of addressing items that are left to national discretion under the Accord, which is entirely appropriate. We also want you to let us know any concerns you have about cross-border implementation. We would be grateful if you could be as specific as possible about your concerns, since that would greatly assist in the resolution of the issues.ConclusionIn conclusion, we are encouraged by the progress that international supervisors and banking organizations have made in preparing for the implementation of Basel II, and we look forward to the continuing dialogue which will help inform further refinements to our approach. The preparations for Basel II have already had a positive impact on banks’ efforts to update their risk-measurement and -management processes. As risk management continues to become more complex and quantitative, it will underscore the importance of further improvements in data architecture and information technology systems development. Of course, a lot of work remains as we move toward a final rulemaking in the United States. We actively seek comments on our proposed rule and encourage an open dialogue with the banking industry and other interested parties, since such communications will undoubtedly improve the proposal. Substantial benefits can be derived from the more risk-sensitive approach to regulatory capital and the continual improvement in risk measurement and management that are the central themes of Basel II. Thank you for inviting me to speak today. In keeping with the theme of this conference, I will offer some thoughts on the systemic risk implications of the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry and on ways that policymakers might respond to those risks.LTCM and the Working Group\\'s RecommendationsAs the title of the report indicated, the Working Group focused on the potential for leverage to create systemic risk in financial markets. The concern arises because, all else being equal, highly leveraged investors are more vulnerable to market shocks. If leveraged investors default while holding positions that are large relative to the markets in which they have invested, the forced liquidation of those positions, possibly at fire-sale prices, could cause heavy losses to counterparties. These direct losses are of concern, of course, particularly if they lead to further defaults or threaten systemically important institutions; but, in addition, market participants that were not creditors or counterparties of the defaulting firm might be affected indirectly through asset price adjustments, liquidity strains, and increased market uncertainty.The primary mechanism for regulating excessive leverage and other aspects of risk-taking in a market economy is the discipline provided by creditors, counterparties, and investors. In the LTCM episode, unfortunately, market discipline broke down. LTCM received generous terms from the banks and broker-dealers that provided credit and served as counterparties, even though LTCM took exceptional risks. Investors, perhaps awed by the reputations of LTCM\\'s principals, did not ask sufficiently tough questions about the risks that were being taken to generate the high returns. Together with the admittedly extraordinary market conditions of August 1998, these risk-management lapses were an important source of the LTCM crisis.The Working Group\\'s central policy recommendation was that regulators and supervisors should foster an environment in which market discipline--in particular, counterparty risk management--constrains excessive leverage and risk-taking. Effective market discipline requires that counterparties and creditors obtain sufficient information to reliably assess clients\\' risk profiles and that they have systems to monitor and limit exposures to levels commensurate with each client\\'s riskiness and creditworthiness. Placing the onus on market participants to provide discipline makes good economic sense; private agents generally have strong incentives to monitor counterparties as well as the best access to the information needed to do so effectively.For various reasons, however, creditors may not fully internalize the costs of systemic financial problems; and time and competition may dull memory and undermine risk-management discipline. The Working Group concluded, accordingly, that supervisors and regulators should ensure that banks and broker-dealers implement the systems and policies necessary to strengthen and maintain market discipline, making several specific recommendations to that effect. The Working Group\\'s recommendations on this point have largely been followed. Domestically, regulatory authorities issued guidance on risk-management practices, and bank supervisors now actively monitor and conduct targeted reviews of banks\\' dealings with hedge funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensified its risk-management inspections of the larger broker-dealers after LTCM. Internationally, both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions produced papers on sound practices in dealings with highly leveraged institutions, and the Basel Committee conducted a series of follow-up studies.An alternative policy response that the Working Group considered, but did not recommend, was direct regulation of hedge funds. Direct regulation may be justified when market discipline is ineffective at constraining excessive leverage and risk-taking but, in the case of hedge funds, the reasonable presumption is that market discipline can work. Investors, creditors, and counterparties have significant incentives to rein in hedge funds\\' risk-taking. Moreover, direct regulation would impose costs in the form of moral hazard, the likely loss of private market discipline, and possible limits on funds\\' ability to provide market liquidity.In focusing on counterparty risk management in its recommendations, the Working Group did not intend to prevent failures in the hedge fund industry. Hedge funds offer their investors high prospective returns but also high levels of risk. Experienced investors know, or should know, that in any given year some hedge funds lose money for their investors and some funds go out of business. Those occurrences are only normal and to be expected in a competitive market economy. The Working Group\\'s recommendations were aimed, instead, at ensuring that when hedge funds fail, as some inevitably will, the effects will be manageable and the potential for adverse consequences to the broader financial system or to real economic activity will be limited.Effectiveness of the Working Group\\'s ApproachHas the approach proposed by the President\\'s Working Group worked? Any answer must be provisional, but, to date, it apparently has been effective. Since the LTCM crisis, ongoing improvements in counterparty risk management and the resultant strengthening of market discipline appear to have limited hedge fund leverage and improved the ability of banks and broker-dealers to monitor risk, despite the rapidly increasing size, diversity, and complexity of the hedge fund industry. Many hedge funds have been liquidated, and investors have suffered losses, but creditors and counterparties have, for the most part, not taken losses. The general perception among market participants is that hedge funds are less highly leveraged today than in 1998 though, to be sure, meaningful and consistent measurements of leverage are not easy to come by and many newer financial products embed significant leverage in relatively nontransparent ways.According to bank supervisors and most market participants, counterparty risk management has improved significantly since 1998. Some of this progress is due to industry-led efforts, such as two reports by the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG) that lay out principles that institutions should use in measuring, monitoring, and managing risk. Reviews conducted by bank supervisors in 2004 and 2005 indicated that banks have become more diligent in their dealings with hedge funds. In most cases, substantial resources have been devoted to expanding and improving the staffing of the risk-management functions related to hedge fund counterparties. Dealers universally require hedge funds to post collateral to cover current credit exposures and, with some exceptions, require additional collateral, or initial margin, to cover potential exposures that could arise if markets moved sharply. Now, risk managers can more accurately measure their current and projected exposures to hedge fund counterparties, and more firms use stress-testing methodologies to assess the sensitivity of their exposures to individual counterparties if the market moves substantially.Despite this progress, some concerns about counterparty risk management remain and may have become even more pronounced given the increasing complexity of financial products. I will note four of these concerns. First, hedge funds are profitable customers for dealers, and our supervisors are concerned that competition for hedge fund business has eroded initial margin levels. Second, given the increasing volume of complex transactions with hedge funds, we are also concerned whether counterparty exposures in such complex transactions are being measured accurately. Supervisors are monitoring banks with these issues in mind. Third, our supervisors are concerned that more extensive stress-testing should be done. Although stress-testing of exposures at the level of the individual hedge fund counterparty is becoming more common, still-wider application of this technique would be useful. Similarly, aggregate stress tests--by which a dealer evaluates its exposure to the hedge-fund sector in the event of a large market move--merit wider use. Aggregate stress tests are a desirable complement to stress tests of individual hedge fund counterparties because funds sometimes imitate each others\\' strategies or choose strategies that are affected by common market factors. Supervisors are encouraging the expanded use of stress-testing when it is appropriate. Fourth, supervisors are concerned that the assessment of counterparty risks should be better tied to the amount of transparency offered by hedge funds. In particular, good risk management should link the availability and the terms of credit granted to a hedge fund to the fund\\'s willingness to provide information on its strategies and risk profile. Our supervisors are pushing banks to clearly link transparency with credit terms and conditions.Since the Working Group report was issued, hedge funds have greatly expanded their activities and strategies, and their interactions with counterparties and creditors have accordingly become more complex. The continuing challenge for supervisors, counterparties, and hedge funds is to ensure that rigorous and appropriate methods of risk management are brought to bear even as institutions, instruments, and markets change. Two recent challenges of note are the spread of prime brokerage services and the emergence of operational issues in the settling of trades in newer types of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, particularly credit derivatives.Hedge funds have long used arrangements that allow them to execute trades with several dealers but then to consolidate the clearing and settlement of their trades at a single firm, the \"prime broker.\" The prime broker typically provides financing and back-office accounting services to the hedge fund as well as settlement services. In the past couple of years, prime brokerage has expanded beyond cash trades for securities to include foreign exchange and OTC derivative trades, and more firms are offering prime brokerage services.Prime brokerage poses some unique challenges for the management of counterparty credit and operational risk. Prime brokers must ensure that they have adequate information and controls to protect against counterparty credit risk arising both from the client and from the executing dealer. They also must implement internal controls to monitor and track transactions executed as part of the prime brokerage agreement and to ensure that the transactions meet the terms of the agreement. Supervisors of firms that offer prime brokerage services, particularly supervisors of new entrants, must ensure that the firms are fully aware of the risks involved and effectively manage them.The proliferation of new financial products also poses risk-management challenges, including challenges on the operational side. For example, trading in credit derivatives has grown dramatically in recent years, and firms have had difficulties in processing and settling these and other OTC derivative trades in a timely way. These problems are not limited to hedge funds but affect all participants in the OTC derivatives market and all dealers in credit derivatives. Recently, supervisors in several jurisdictions, working with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have pushed firms to improve their processes for confirming and assigning trades. So far, good progress has been made, with private-sector participants meeting most of their objectives for reducing backlogs. Commitments are in place to effect still further improvement.A noteworthy feature of these efforts is the cooperation among authorities. The Federal Reserve has devoted more effort in recent years to maintaining a dialogue with international supervisors, such as the U.K. Financial Services Authority, and we will continue to do so. Domestically, the Federal Reserve is coordinating with the SEC, which is the primary regulator of several large firms that deal in OTC derivatives or engage in prime brokerage activities.Proposals for Creating a Database of Hedge Fund Positions Following the LTCM crisis and the publication of the Working Group\\'s recommendations, the debate about hedge funds and the broader effects of their activities on financial markets abated for a time. That debate, however, has now resumed with vigor--spurred, no doubt, by the creation of many new funds, large reported inflows to funds, and a broadening investor base. Renewed discussion of hedge funds and of their benefits and risks has in turn led to calls for authorities to implement new policies, many of which will be topics of this conference. I will briefly discuss one of these proposals: the development of a database that would contain information on hedge-fund positions and portfolios.It is commonly observed that hedge funds are \"opaque\"--that is, information about their portfolios is typically limited and infrequently provided. It would be more accurate to say that the opacity of hedge funds is in the eye of the beholder; the information a fund provides may vary considerably depending on whether the recipient of the information is an investor, a counterparty, a regulatory authority, or a general market participant. From a policy perspective, transparency to investors is largely an issue of investor protection. The need for counterparties to have adequate information is a risk-management issue, as I have already discussed. Much of the recent debate, however, has focused on the opacity of hedge funds to regulatory authorities and to the markets generally, which is viewed by some as an important source of liquidity risk. Liquidity in a particular market segment might well decline sharply and unexpectedly if hedge funds chose or were forced to reduce a large exposure in that segment.Concerns about hedge fund opacity and possible liquidity risk have motivated a range of proposals for regulatory authorities to create and maintain a database of hedge fund positions. Such a database, it is argued, would allow authorities to monitor this possible source of systemic risk and to address the buildup of risk as it occurs. Various alternatives that have been discussed include a database maintained by regulators on a confidential basis, a system in which hedge funds submit position information to an authority that aggregates that information and reveals it to the market, and a public database with nonconfidential information on hedge funds.I understand the concerns that motivate these proposals but, at this point, remain skeptical about their utility in practice. To measure liquidity risks accurately, the authorities would need data from all major financial market participants, not just hedge funds. As a practical matter, could the authorities collect such an enormous quantity of highly sensitive information in sufficient detail and with sufficient frequency (daily, at least) to be effectively informed about liquidity risk in particular market segments? How would the authorities use the information? Would they have the authority to direct hedge funds or other large financial institutions to reduce positions? If several funds had similar positions, how would authorities avoid giving a competitive advantage to one fund over another in using the information from the database? Perhaps most important, would counterparties relax their vigilance if they thought the authorities were monitoring and constraining hedge funds\\' risk-taking? A risk of any prescriptive regulatory regime is that, by creating moral hazard in the marketplace, it leaves the system less rather than more stable.A system in which hedge funds and other highly leveraged market participants submit position information to an authority that aggregates that information and reveals it to the market would probably not be able to address the concern about liquidity risk. Protection of proprietary information would require so much aggregation that the value of the information to market participants would be substantially reduced. Timeliness of the data would also be an issue.A public database of nonproprietary information could provide the public with a general picture of hedge-fund activity without creating the false impression that the authorities were engaged in prudential oversight of hedge funds. Such a public database might demystify hedge funds, but it would not address the central policy concern that opacity creates liquidity risk.I expect discussion and analysis of the potential costs and benefits of increased disclosures will continue, as well as suggestions about how such disclosures might be structured and disseminated. The important challenge is to structure any disclosures in a way that does not generate moral hazard or weaken market discipline.ConclusionIn the final analysis, authorities cannot entirely eliminate systemic risk. To try to do so would likely stifle innovation without achieving the intended goal. However, authorities should (and will) try to ensure that the lapses in risk management of 1998 do not happen again. Private market participants, too, have their role to play in ensuring that such lapses do not recur. The principles articulated in the CRMPG\\'s reports are a good starting place for firms, and senior management should rigorously assess their operations against those principles and commit the resources to address deficiencies. Authorities\\' primary task is to guard against a return of the weak market discipline that left major market participants overly vulnerable to market shocks. Continued focus on counterparty risk management is likely the best course for addressing systemic concerns related to hedge funds. This public policy approach does not entail the moral hazard concerns created by authorities\\' monitoring of positions using a private database. Rather, a focus on counterparty risk management places the responsibility for monitoring risk squarely on the private market participants with the best incentives and capacity to do so. Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective on effective compliance risk management for diversified financial institutions. This area of risk management has been receiving a good deal of attention lately. Risk, to state the obvious, is inherent in all activities in the financial services industry. Because the industry is heavily regulated, compliance risk is an important element of the activities in which you are engaged.Today, the financial services industry is experiencing tremendous growth, diversification, and innovation. This growth should be embraced as we consider the future of our financial sector. However, our \"embrace\" should be in the form of a sound risk-management framework. My remarks today will focus on what Federal Reserve supervisors see as the key components of a sound and effective compliance-risk management framework.Before I begin, let me clarify what I mean by \"compliance risk.\" Compliance risk can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation and franchise value that arises when a banking organization fails to comply with laws, regulations, or the standards or codes of conduct of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization\\'s business activities and functions.A consolidated--or \"enterprise-wide\"--approach to compliance risk management has become \"mission critical\" for large, complex banking organizations, for several reasons. First, because compliance failures have touched many businesses, including banking, securities, and insurance firms, it has become clear that companies operating in more than one type of business must have a compliance strategy that is both globally consistent and locally effective. Increasingly, large, complex organizations are taking an enterprise-wide compliance-risk management approach to augment and better coordinate what had been fragmented and duplicative compliance activities. Such an approach puts local compliance activities within individual business lines into an integrated, global program, makes possible an understanding of compliance requirements and performance across an organization, and promotes consistency in responsibility, expectations, documentation, assessment, and reporting. I have been told that this more-integrated approach to compliance risk management by industry is already having a positive effect on risk identification and mitigation.Second, the need for an enterprise-wide approach to compliance risk management at larger, more complex firms is suggested by the diversity of laws and regulations that span business lines, legal entities, and geographic boundaries--for example, in the areas of Bank Secrecy Act compliance and anti-money laundering controls, fair lending, information security, privacy, transactions with affiliates (Regulation W), and conflicts of interest. A more-integrated approach may be warranted for other matters, as well, because similar laws and regulations exist across the various jurisdictions in which the organization operates, both in the United States and overseas.Because of the nature and levels of risks inherent to their business activities, complex banking organizations should have in place a compliance-risk management framework that makes it possible to identify, monitor, and effectively control the compliance risks facing their entire organization. Of course, such a framework needs to be commensurate with the nature and level of the organization\\'s compliance risk. It should evolve with the ever-changing product lines and business activities of any growth-oriented organization. And, of course, it needs to stay on top of regulatory developments.Setting the Tone at the Top--The Role of the Board of DirectorsA successful compliance-risk management program starts at the top of the organization. It is essential that the board of directors take the lead by requiring a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is well-communicated and incorporated into the organization\\'s day-to-day operations by senior management, in order to ensure that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities and their roles in implementing the enterprise-wide program. A strong compliance culture is evidenced by the extent to which employees work together both to raise concerns about compliance risks and to design and establish effective controls.A sound and effective enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program has strong board and senior management oversight. However, it is important to note that the board of directors and senior management have distinct, though complementary, roles in ensuring the program\\'s success. As I mentioned, the board of directors is responsible for requiring a strong compliance culture. This environment should assure that compliance is an integral part of day-to-day operations. To this end, the board should approve the key elements of the program and then entrust responsibility for embedding the culture and implementing the program to managers and staff at all levels of the organization. Periodically, the board should be apprised of the extent to which predetermined benchmarks are being met.Many of the largest and most complex banking organizations have established a corporate-level function to oversee their enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program, and the Federal Reserve views this trend very favorably. In these cases, the central function has been staffed with experienced compliance officers who are able to provide substantive guidance to business line managers and to keep senior management and boards of directors informed on how well the program is functioning, including by alerting them promptly about any material compliance breaches. Overall, such a central function can contribute a great deal toward ensuring that the key elements of a sound and effective compliance-risk management program are present and functioning as intended.Corporate Standards--Tailored within the Business LinesHow does a board-mandated \"compliance culture\" permeate a banking organization? Among other ways, the culture and expectations are communicated through enterprise-wide compliance-risk management standards or objectives--established by senior management within a corporate-level compliance function--that reflect the expectations of the board.Regardless of the compliance-risk management framework employed, the business line managers continue to \"own\" the compliance risk. That is, they are responsible for achieving compliance in their business lines and suffer the consequences in the event of compliance failures or missteps. Business line managers convert the corporate compliance risk standards or objectives into policies and procedures tailored to the specific type and level of compliance risk inherent in their activities and to the specific laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate.To create appropriate compliance risk controls, organizations seek first to understand compliance risk across the entire entity. Managers assess and evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually. However, an enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program is dynamic and proactive, meaning that risks are assessed whenever new business lines or activities are added or existing activities and processes are altered. Once a particular business line has identified and assessed its compliance risks, it can design policies, detailed day-to-day procedures and processes, and associated risk-mitigating internal controls. The corporate compliance function plays an important role in advising business line managers as they assess risk. Such counsel adds to consistency in approach and helps control for mis-estimated risk. The corporate compliance function\\'s involvement also increases the organization\\'s ability to aggregate and better understand risks across the organization. Understanding of risk helps both the business lines and the compliance function develop internal controls that are reasonably designed to mitigate the risk.While the industry trend toward more-consolidated compliance risk management is a favorable development, it is critical that business line management remain engaged. As I noted, senior managers in the business lines remain the \"owners\" of the risk, and compliance risk mitigation must be integrated into their overall business processes. The sense of ownership can be reinforced by factoring compliance ratings into performance measures and rewards. I am aware that, increasingly, organizations are tying compensation to management\\'s ability to maintain strong internal controls and compliance processes. This practice helps keep the organization focused on managing compliance risk. To ensure that issues are escalated as they arise, the compliance staff embedded within the business lines should be independent and should have a clear reporting relationship to the corporate compliance-risk management function. In addition, to be most effective, the business line compliance staff should be \"right-sized\" to the level of risk within that business line.Clear lines of reporting, authority, and communication are key to the success of any compliance-risk management framework. Policies and procedures should spell out for business line staff how to escalate compliance concerns, should delineate responsibilities (avoiding overlapping roles and conflicts of interest), and should ultimately ensure that the board and senior management are fully apprised of material compliance events.Monitoring and ReportingAs I mentioned at the start, the fundamental purpose of the enterprise-wide compliance-risk management framework is to identify, monitor, and manage compliance risk more effectively. Among other things, monitoring is the means of identifying and communicating compliance breaches to the appropriate points within the organization. Banking organizations are establishing processes for monitoring the implementation of compliance policies, procedures, and controls, at both the consolidated and business line levels.Sound compliance-risk monitoring activities at large, complex banking organizations are supported by information systems that provide management with timely reports related to compliance with laws and regulations at the transaction level. These reports generally address monitoring and testing activities, actual or potential material compliance deficiencies or breaches, and new or changing compliance requirements. Reports such as these ensure that information on compliance is communicated to the appropriate levels within the organization. Monitoring and reporting enable senior management and the board to effectively carry out their respective responsibilities.At the frontier of compliance risk monitoring, larger, more complex banking organizations are moving toward the collection and analysis of quantitative information relating to compliance risk activities at the transaction level. Bearing in mind that this is an evolving area, banking organizations are investing in the development and application of such information as key risk indicators and key performance indicators in order to facilitate more accurate and more timely monitoring. Increased development and use of key compliance risk and performance indicators will ultimately enable better measurement, monitoring, and control of compliance risk.TestingAs with other control functions within an organization, independent testing should be conducted to verify that compliance-risk mitigation activities, including training and internal controls, are in place and functioning as intended throughout the organization. Whereas monitoring is an ongoing process, testing is a \"point-in-time\" event, a critical check of performance. The frequency of testing should be based on risk--on such factors as whether significant deficiencies were identified through a recent examination or during the last testing; whether the business line\\'s products or activities have grown or changed significantly; or whether a high risk that may directly affect the organization\\'s activities has been identified.Exceptions to the corporate-wide risk standards or objectives are reported to senior management, and I understand that this is most effectively done through reporting channels not under the direct control of business line management; however, resolution of the exceptions is the responsibility of business line management. An exception is tracked until its resolution has been validated. Importantly, a sound testing program contains provisions for escalating unresolved exceptions to higher levels in the organization, including the board of directors. Of course, the program should clearly define and communicate the roles of the internal audit, compliance, and other independent functions or third parties, although these roles will vary by organization.Testing provides important feedback on how well the internal control framework is operating in practice, pointing the way toward any remedial actions that need to be taken. This essential part of an internal control framework can be performed by compliance personnel, audit personnel, or third-party firms that have specialized expertise. While banking organizations sometimes outsource compliance testing or other compliance function tasks, the organization itself remains accountable and must exercise appropriate oversight.The \"War for Talent\"We\\'ve heard industry leaders refer to their compliance recruitment process as a \"war for talent.\" Running an effective enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program requires more than policies, procedures, and management information systems. Decisions are made by senior management on the basis of advice from their staff. Consequently, talent is required at all levels. In assessing the risk management of individual organizations, we have noted the importance of staff who have experience and expertise consistent with the scope and complexity of an organization\\'s business activities. Staff must also have the integrity, ethical values, and competence consistent with a prudent management philosophy and operating style. We understand that hiring and retaining qualified and experienced compliance staff is a key challenge across the industry. Successful organizations are focusing not only on recruiting talent, but also on developing staff from within. Training and other staff-development tools are essential in this time of \"war for compliance talent.\"The Role of the RegulatorsThe business lines and activities of financial services firms can cross the jurisdictional boundaries of many legal entities, making it more difficult for a supervisory agency acting alone to determine what went wrong and what processes may need to be improved. In these cases, the Federal Reserve, as the consolidated supervisor of the banking organization in question, works closely with the primary bank regulator and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate control breakdowns. The agencies exchange information and compare their findings. For example, findings from SEC examinations of broker-dealers, investment advisers, and mutual fund distributors are analyzed together with findings from targeted joint reviews of bank holding companies and banks conducted by the Federal Reserve and the primary bank regulators. This is the way the functional regulators should and will work in the environment of diversified financial institutions.ConclusionControlling compliance risk may be easier said than done. Certainly, establishment of an effective enterprise-wide compliance-risk management function and program is not done overnight. Nor is it done without costs--both monetary costs and the intangible costs inherent in real cultural change. However, it is clear that all organizations must find ways to effectively manage compliance risk--and there is growing consensus within the industry that for some of the largest and most complex organizations, an enterprise-wide approach to controlling compliance risk is no longer just a \"nice thing to have.\" Rather, it has become an essential element of effective risk management. The Evolution of Institutions and MarketsMaintaining the stability of the financial system and containing the systemic risk that may arise in financial markets has been central to the Federal Reserve’s mission for as long as there has been a Federal Reserve. Indeed, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer and more stable monetary and financial system.Thus, the focus of this conference--understanding systemic risk--is not new, though some of the names have changed. At the beginning of the twentieth century, banks were virtually the only financial intermediary available. Periodically, these highly leveraged institutions lost the confidence of depositors, fell into crisis, and reduced their lending to creditworthy borrowers, thereby accentuating economic downturns. The tools that were developed to prevent and to manage financial crises--lender-of-last-resort facilities, supervision and regulation aimed at bank safety and soundness, deposit insurance, and the provision of payment system services--were geared toward a bank-denominated system.Today, multiple avenues of financial intermediation are available, and the financial system has become much more market-dominated. This evolution of financial institutions and markets probably has made the financial system more resilient. Financial innovations, such as the development of derivatives markets and the securitization of assets, have enabled intermediaries to diversify and manage risk better. Moreover, as markets have become more important, ultimate borrowers have acquired more avenues to tailor their risk profiles and are less dependent on particular lenders, and savers have become better able to diversify and to manage their portfolios. Consequently, the economy has become less vulnerable to problems at individual types of institutions.However, the evolution of financial institutions and markets has not removed the underlying risks and uncertainty associated with financial transactions. Financial institutions and other market participants must still make decisions and take actions with incomplete knowledge about the condition of their counterparties. Actual (or perceived) information asymmetries can increase enormously during times of heightened market volatility or economic stress. In addition, in such circumstances, investors may become very uncertain about the behavior of other market participants and the resulting path of asset prices and extent of market liquidity, creating a situation in which each market participant waits to see how other investors will react.When this happens, the typical correlations derived from historical experience tend to break down, liquidity may be more costly to obtain or unavailable, normal risk management strategies may no longer be useful, questions about counterparty solvency escalate, and the result can be a financial crisis. In times of such high uncertainty, it is human nature to act very cautiously. Investors uncertain about what shocks other market participants have experienced and unsure about what those other market participants are likely to do tend to withdraw from potentially risky financial activities and to hold safer and more liquid assets, such as government securities.As a consequence, creditworthy borrowers may not be funded, just like in the old days when banks fell into crisis. These disruptions in the flow of credit in turn can have real effects on the macroeconomy. Moreover, these real effects can create feedback effects on market participants that exacerbate the original financial crisis.These motivations and reactions persist in the twenty-first century, and thus so does the possibility of financial crisis, even if the key propagation mechanisms for crisis in our financial system may have changed. The shift from a bank-dominated financial system to a combination of centralized and decentralized markets has increased the importance of market liquidity for determining asset prices and for managing portfolios. The increased importance of markets also has created new and complex interactions among participants in the financial system and heightened the reliance on key market utilities.We are in the process of adapting the tools that were developed to prevent and manage financial crises in a bank-dominated financial system to prevent and manage financial crises in the more market-dominated financial system. This is an ongoing process that is very much informed by our experience with past financial crises. In that regard, the 1987 stock market crash and the liquidity crisis in the fall of 1998 are likely to be more typical of modern financial events. In the rest of my talk, I will discuss the following aspects of these two events: their common elements, the Federal Reserve’s response, lessons learned for crisis management, and implications for crisis prevention in the more market-driven financial system.Two Modern Financial CrisesThe 1987 stock market crash may have been the first modern financial crisis in the United States. Unlike previous financial crises, the 1987 stock market decline was not associated with a deposit run or any other problem in the banking sector. Instead, the 20 percent decline on October 19, 1987, in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index--the largest single-day decline since the Great Depression--was driven by investor decisions to reduce equity exposures and by the resulting chaotic trading in the stock markets. Indeed, trading was so chaotic that stock prices were difficult to determine.The liquidity crisis in the fall of 1998 was triggered by the Russian debt default in August and then aggravated by the problems at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. During the 1998 crisis, risk spreads widened sharply, stock prices fell, and liquidity became so highly valued that the spread between on- and off-the-run Treasury securities widened substantially. Of even more concern, the capital markets virtually seized up as market participants retreated from risk taking, and, for a time, credit was simply unavailable to many private borrowers at any price.The events of 1987 and 1998 had several common elements. First, they began with sharp movements in asset prices. Second, these price movements were exacerbated by market participants trying to protect themselves--with portfolio insurance in 1987 and by closing out positions in 1998. Third, market participants became highly uncertain about the dynamics of the market, the “true” value of assets, and the future movement of asset prices. As a consequence, with their standard risk-management systems seemingly inapplicable, they pulled back from making markets and taking positions and further exacerbated the price action. Fourth, the large and rapid price movements called into doubt the creditworthiness of counterparties, which could no longer be judged by now obsolete financial statements; credit decisions were further complicated by uncertainty about the value of collateral. In turn, the defensive behavior of market participants escalated and reinforced adverse market dynamics. Finally, the decline in asset prices reduced wealth and raised the cost of capital, which seemed likely to reduce both consumption and investment.Naturally, the Federal Reserve’s response to these crises also had several common elements. We publicly acknowledged that a crisis was under way, and through this recognition and our follow-up actions, we sought to reassure participants that we were doing what we could to limit the possible systemic effects on the economy. The hope was that such reassurance might encourage a return to risk-taking. Accordingly, open market operations were directed toward an easing of reserve-market conditions and were guided by day-to-day developments. For example, in October 1987, open market operations accommodated substantially enlarged desires for excess reserves and a large increase in required reserves associated with a sharp rise in transactions deposits. We monitored the flow of credit through the financial system, and we pointed out to lenders their collective interest in avoiding a credit gridlock that would only tend to accentuate asset price movements. We worked with other agencies to identify weak points in the market and impediments to its functioning. We also eased the stance of monetary policy to counteract the systemic consequences of the ongoing financial crisis.Principles to be Drawn From Recent Financial CrisesWhat are the principles for Federal Reserve actions that we can draw from these experiences, as well as from other recent, but less severe periods of financial turmoil? First and foremost, the management of financial crisis is easier, and the consequences are less severe, if the economy is in healthy condition. Partly as a consequence in neither 1987 nor in 1998 did the crisis lead to a recession. As monetary policy makers, we improve the odds of financial stability over time when we focus on the fundamentals of maintaining price stability and sustainable growth. When the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy so as to create low and stable inflation and to firmly anchor expectations that inflation will be contained, it best positions itself to forcefully offset the ill effects of a financial crisis without generating deep concerns that such actions will result in sharply higher inflation. Some argue that economic stability can set the stage for financial instability by breeding complacency about risk. Perhaps, but surely the benefits of macroeconomic stability far outweigh its possible costs.Another principle is that a healthy banking system works hand-in-hand with a healthy economy to substantially mitigate the consequences of financial crisis. Banks continue to play critical roles in the market-dominated system, including financing market participant’s holdings of securities and clearing and settling their trades. Healthy banks can be bulwarks against the propagation of financial turmoil; in contrast, questions about the health of banks would raise additional concerns during the course of a crisis.A third principle is that the actions taken to prevent a crisis should not raise the odds of creating more problems in the future. In particular, the problem of moral hazard is a significant concern. If market participants begin to rely too much on regulators and central bankers to manage possible future crises, they may act in a way that has the effect of raising the risk of a financial crisis. For example, they may fail to engage in adequate due diligence when extending credit to other market participants or to maintain adequate capital for the risks they undertake. And they might come to believe that the government possesses more tools and resources than are actually available to shield them from the consequences of poor risk management.The central bank can draw from a menu of actions that involve varying degrees of moral hazard. Those actions range from loans to individual institutions that otherwise would not have access to credit, to moral suasion, to open market operations, which allow the markets to distribute credit and should not cause distortions in private-sector decisionmaking.Heightened uncertainty is the key characteristic of episodes of financial instability. The central bank may not have any more information than market participants do; in economic models based on such uncertainties, it is the central bank’s willingness to act in the face of uncertainty that differentiates it from other market participants and gives it a positive role to play during financial crises. Its willingness to act ameliorates the negative effects of the uncertainty of other market participants about the solvency of counterparties and the status of markets.Still, the more information the central bank has, the easier it is for it to choose the best course of action. Policymakers want to choose the path with the lowest moral-hazard consequences to leave market participants with incentives to manage risk appropriately. But policymakers are in a difficult position in a crisis. The costs of not acting forcefully enough will be immediate and obvious--additional disruption to the financial markets and the economy. The costs of acting too forcefully--of interfering unnecessarily in markets and creating moral hazard--manifest themselves over a longer period and may never be traceable to a particular policy choice. The natural inclination to take more intrusive actions that minimize the risks of immediate disruption is probably exacerbated by ignorance and uncertainty; the less you know, the easier it is to imagine bad outcomes and the more reliant you may be on people in the market whose self-interest may well color the information they are giving you.In a bank-dominated financial system, the critical information would have come from fellow bank regulators with whom we had been working or from the institutions we collectively had been examining for some time. In a world of financial institutions with a presence in many lines of business crossing national boundaries, obtaining such information, developing cogent analyses, and deciding on a course of action in a crisis requires widespread cooperation among many disparate agencies. Moreover, I should note that, even for possible bank-centric crises, the financial landscape in the United States has changed. The large bank holding companies are involved in a myriad of businesses that cross a multitude of regulatory boundaries. In addition, any future financial crisis that does involve a large, complex banking organization might need to grapple with the “systemic risk exception” that was passed by the Congress in 1993, which requires the boards of the Federal Reserve and of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the President to act jointly.Establishing the needed coordination across many agencies could potentially create delays during a time when quick action is needed. Moreover, different regulators can have different supervisory philosophies. These potential impediments to a timely response suggest that regulators need to be discussing the possibilities associated with financial crisis on an ongoing basis and long before an actual event. These discussions should encompass the possible actions that might be needed and the information that should be on hand to shape those actions in the public interest.Reducing the Odds on Financial Crises This brings me to my final and most important principle--an ounce of prevention is worth many pounds of cure. As we’ve seen in recent years, macroeconomic stability has not forestalled large and unexpected movements in asset prices. Shocks occur, or reality catches up to unreasonable expectations, and market prices adjust, sometimes very substantially and suddenly. And although the financial system has become more resilient to such unanticipated developments, it is still subject to bouts of increased uncertainty that could build on themselves to disrupt the normal functioning of markets and send asset prices further away from fundamentals, with potentially adverse implications for the economy. Drawing on our experiences, the Federal Reserve has been working with other regulatory agencies and the private sector both here and abroad to strengthen the financial system in order to lower the odds that a sharp change in prices or questions about a major market participant would lead to a systemic financial crisis. Our collective efforts have been in three areas: enhancing market discipline; encouraging sound risk management; and strengthening clearing and settlement systems.Market discipline through vigilance among private parties is always to be preferred to regulatory dictates as the prime source of constraint on possible crisis-causing behavior. It lessens the odds of a financial crisis and any potential moral hazard that might be created by governmental actions taken during periods of financial market turmoil. Reliance on market discipline becomes even more of an imperative when key market participants are subject to widely varying degrees and types of regulation from different regulators. For market discipline to be effective, counterparties must have a clear understanding of each others’ risk profile. Such transparency can be promoted through sound policies regarding accounting and, where necessary and appropriate, public disclosure. However, a meaningful understanding of risk profiles often requires information that market participants regard as proprietary. Confidentiality agreements between counterparties may be necessary to make them comfortable sharing such information. Counterparties that cannot obtain sufficient information should limit more strictly the amount of credit they supply through, for example, requiring higher margins.In a market-based system, sound risk management by all market participants is essential to protect against the risk that a low-probability--or “tail”--event could cause a financial crisis. Such practices enhance financial stability without increasing moral hazard. Indeed, sound risk management by all market participants would reduce moral hazard. Market participants familiar with the risk metrics, the stress-test methodologies (and the associated market scenarios), the models, and other analytics used by their counterparties’ risk managers would be more likely to continue to provide access to credit during periods of systemic and institutional stress. Of course, the more that privately provided credit continues to flow in such circumstances, the lower the odds on a crisis and on the need for government intervention.It is a tall order to “plan” for the unexpected, improbable, and unknowable nature of future financial market crisis, but actions by the authorities, such as supporting risk-management policy groups and promoting stress-testing, should help. For example, bringing together practitioners can potentially improve both the markets’ and the central bank’s understanding of how leverage, liquidity, and concentration are interrelated. In addition, risk-management policy groups can potentially lead to improvements in the reporting of risk information to counterparties and allow for the transfer of best practices across market participants with respect to valuation, exposure measurement, limit setting, and internal checks and balances. Indeed, a lesson drawn by the President’s Working Group from the 1998 crisis was that a lack of basic risk management, and the resulting ability of risk managers to avoid counterparty discipline, was an important factor that enabled key market participants to become so large that their troubles could disrupt entire markets.Stress tests employ either historical data from asset price distributions or hypothetical scenarios that would provide insights into the downside financial risks associated with investments and associated hedging strategies. Focusing market participants on the structure of stress, and thus their risks beyond the range of recent historical experience, might assist in limiting the affects of a highly infrequent but significantly costly tail event.The regulatory capital framework proposed in Basel II would require the largest internationally active banking organizations to enhance measurement and management of their risks, including credit risk and operational risk. It would also require these entities to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profile and to publicly disclose information on their risk profile. Because such actions would likely provide market participants with a better sense of how others might act during a crisis, these actions would likely help mitigate the adverse consequences created by financial market turmoil.Risk cannot be managed if participants are uncertain about their exposures to counterparty credit risk and to changes in prices. It is important for trades to be cleared and settled when expected at the agreed upon price with the anticipated counterparties. As a result, the central bank must promote robust payment and settlement systems. Sound risk-management practices and stress testing by operators of the settlement infrastructure are critically important in this domain. If payment and settlement systems have adequate collateral and liquidity to settle during turbulent periods, they reduce the threat of contagion across institutions and markets. To this end, the Federal Reserve actively participates in international groups, such as the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, that identify and promulgate best practices.Counterparty discipline, sound risk management, and strong and resilient clearing and settlement are all in the interest of private parties. Nonetheless, government has a role to play, especially when it senses moral hazard is weakening market discipline on risk taking and leaving the broader interests of society inadequately protected. Regulators may need to insist on minimal capital levels and on actions to strengthen private systems. In addition, they may need to work with disparate private parties and help market competitors take collective actions to solve problems that such competitors might otherwise find difficult to solve by themselves. For example, the Federal Reserve Board recently endorsed the chartering of a dormant bank, referred to as NewBank, which would be available for activation to clear and settle U.S. government securities. Such activation would occur if an existing clearing bank could not operate and no well-qualified bank stepped forward to purchase its clearing business. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and other regulatory bodies have met with major dealers to strengthen the clearing and settlement infrastructure for the credit derivatives markets.ConclusionMaintaining the stability of the financial system and containing the systemic risk that may arise in financial markets is central to the Federal Reserve’s mission. Recent financial crises within the United States have been well contained. However, with the rapid evolution of the financial system, there is a real possibility that markets are evolving faster than the efforts by market participants to better control risk and to improve the payment and settlement infrastructure.New markets have been tested to some extent--by the stock market crash, by the widening of spreads in 2001 and 2002, and by the problems of the auto companies and their suppliers. So far, despite some glitches, markets have adapted and changed when deficiencies became obvious. No doubt, markets and institutions have become more flexible and resilient. But perhaps we have also been lucky; prudence dictates that we identify points of weakness and strengthen them.And, in a rapidly evolving financial system, we need to think creatively about where the weakness might be and how disturbances might be transmitted and amplified. Thus, this conference has the potential to contribute materially to our ability to continue to fulfill our most basic mandate: To foster an efficient, stable financial system in support of our nation’s economic welfare.Footnotes I am pleased to speak to you this morning at what has become, over more than four decades, perhaps the most prestigious conference for bankers, academics, and bank supervisors in the United States. In every year but one of his tenure, Chairman Greenspan spoke at this meeting, and he sometimes used the occasion to advocate major changes to the bank regulatory system. Notable examples include the revisions to deposit insurance and bank capital standards that were embedded in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), the relaxation of restrictions on interstate banking in the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, and the repeal of Glass-Steagall\\'s limits on combinations of commercial and investment banking implemented by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.The broad principles of Basel II have become increasingly clear over many years of discussion and consultation, and I will review them briefly. I will argue that a framework built on these principles is the right one for supervising the largest and most complex institutions. Moreover, the Basel II framework is inherently dynamic; it will be able to adapt to ongoing innovation and change. But I also want to convey today that Basel II remains very much a work in progress. As we proceed toward the implementation of this framework, success will require that bank regulators, the banking industry, the Congress, and other relevant parties engage in an ongoing and frank dialogue, and that policymakers be open-minded, flexible, and ready to make needed adjustments. For our part, the Federal Reserve is committed to getting Basel II right.Financial Innovations in Mortgage and Other MarketsAs in years past, the Chicago Fed has chosen wisely in selecting the theme of the conference. Innovations in the financing of homes and other real estate have come at a remarkable pace over the past decade or more, leading to more sophisticated and flexible instruments, more liquid markets, and better risk-sharing. Taking full advantage of these innovations has required banks and other institutions to make important improvements in risk measurement and risk management.Financial innovations and improved risk management have not been limited to real estate finance, of course. Securitization, improved hedging instruments and strategies, more-liquid markets, greater risk-based pricing, and the data-collection and management systems needed to implement such innovations have also occurred in other retail and wholesale markets.In my judgment, these developments, on net, have provided significant benefits. Borrowers have more choices and greater access to credit; lenders and investors are better able to measure and manage risk; and, because of the dispersion of financial risks to those more willing and able to bear them, the economy and the financial system are more resilient. To be sure, rapid financial innovation carries some risks, if new instruments are used improperly or if the market infrastructure that facilitates the trading of those instruments is inadequate. Regulators must be aware of and ready to mitigate those risks. Overall, however, the public interest is served both by the prudent use of new financial instruments and by the improvements in risk-measurement and risk-management practices that prudent use requires.Implications for Financial RegulationAs market participants innovate and markets become more efficient and sophisticated, bank regulators and supervisors must ensure that they do not fall behind. Indeed, a regulatory and supervisory system that is increasingly divorced from actual business practice may well become counterproductive. A regulatory and supervisory system that is not in tune with practice may increase the costs of regulation, stifle efficiency and innovation, and ultimately be less effective in mitigating the moral hazard problems associated with the financial safety net.Most regulatory changes are incremental, which is entirely appropriate given the inherent uncertainties about how best to respond to market developments and the desire to avoid unintended consequences. Examples of incremental regulatory change are common. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have made more than twenty-five amendments to the Basel I framework in response to ongoing changes in banking and financial markets.But sometimes a more fundamental rethinking of the regulatory framework is needed. Sometimes a crisis is the catalyst for such rethinking, as in the case of the deposit insurance and capital policy reforms in FDICIA that I mentioned earlier. At other times, major change is motivated by the gradual accumulation of factors, such as the blending of commercial and investment banking that evolved before passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I would put the need for Basel II squarely in this latter category. No immediate crisis requires us to move toward Basel II, but the gradual evolution of market practice and the emergence of very large and increasingly complex banking organizations operating on a global scale require that we make significant changes in the way we assess capital adequacy at these organizations. Indeed, waiting for a crisis to force change would be foolish; by moving forward now, we have the luxury of being deliberate in the development and introduction of a system that promises significant benefits.Why Basel II?Many aspects and possible effects of Basel II have been debated, including its potential effects on banks\\' costs and on the competitive landscape. I will discuss some of those aspects shortly. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the core goal of Basel II is to promote the stability of the U.S. financial system by ensuring the safety and soundness of U.S. banks. Its ability to promote that objective is the first criterion on which the proposed Basel II framework should be judged.I stated that the core goal of Basel II is to promote the stability of the U.S. financial system; but, as everyone here understands, the U.S. banking and financial system is increasingly interwoven with that of the rest of the world. Indeed, increasing globalization was a major factor that led the U.S. banking agencies to negotiate the Basel I agreement in 1988. Of course, the extent of globalization of both financial and real product markets is even more extensive today, and systemic financial problems will not respect national borders. Thus, it remains very much in the interest of the United States to continue to encourage international cooperation and consistency in regulating and supervising those banks that pose the greatest potential systemic risk. For this reason, we have chosen to work with our international and domestic colleagues on the Basel Committee to develop a new capital framework for the largest, most complex, and most globally active banking organizations.To maintain U.S. and global financial stability, we want to ensure that banks, particularly our largest and most complex institutions, will remain able to serve their customers and meet their obligations as lenders and counterparties during periods of economic or financial stress. That requires, of course, that banks have both adequate capital and strong risk management. Because confidence promotes stability, it is also important that supervisors and market participants are able to assess for themselves the financial soundness and risk-management capabilities of these institutions.Basel II is a comprehensive framework for improving bank safety and soundness by more closely linking regulatory capital requirements with bank risk, by improving the ability of supervisors and financial markets to assess capital adequacy, and by giving banking organizations stronger incentives to improve risk measurement and management. The framework encompasses three elements: risk-focused regulatory capital requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline. These are the so-called three pillars of Basel II.Under Pillar 1, the risk sensitivity of minimum risk-based capital requirements would be much greater than under the current accord. This greater sensitivity would be achieved by linking each banking organization\\'s capital requirement to empirically based measures of credit and operational risk, as determined in part by risk parameters estimated by that organization, such as a loan\\'s probability of default and its expected loss given default. The methods used to construct such estimates would be subject to supervisory standards, guidance, and reviews, including a requirement that the risk parameters used for Pillar 1 be consistent with risk assessments actually used by the bank for its internal risk management. The Pillar 1 treatment of credit risk also reflects more accurately the risk-reducing effects of guarantees, credit derivatives, and securitization, thus improving regulatory capital incentives for banks to hedge portfolio credit risks. The incorporation of operational risk in Pillar 1 is also a significant step, which recognizes that operational failures are indeed a potentially important risk for many banks, one that they should actively seek to minimize. In addition, Pillar 1 incorporates a more comprehensive treatment of trading account risk.We should not underestimate the importance of strong minimum capital requirements. Strong capital helps banks absorb unexpected shocks and reduces the moral hazard associated with the federal safety net. A key lesson of the banking and thrift crises of the late 1980s and early 1990s is that prudent and explicit minimum regulatory capital requirements are needed to ensure that banks maintain adequate capital and to anchor an effective supervisory system. For example, explicit minimum regulatory capital requirements that accurately reflect a bank\\'s risk provide more-effective triggers for prompt corrective action.Besides making regulatory capital ratios more risk-sensitive, Basel II provides a consistent framework for improving supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and risk management. Under Pillar 2, a bank would be required to maintain a capital cushion above the regulatory minimums to capture the full set of risks to which the bank is exposed. These include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and concentration risk, none of which is reflected in Pillar 1. Currently, the U.S. banking agencies assess a bank\\'s overall capital adequacy as a normal part of the examination process. But the overall quality of both the supervisors\\' and each bank\\'s assessments of capital adequacy should improve greatly under Basel II because of the expanded information that will be available from Pillar 1, from supervisory reviews of a bank\\'s systems for implementing Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, and from the bank\\'s own analyses.Under Pillar 3, banks will be required to disclose to the public the new risk-based capital ratios and more-extensive information about the credit quality of their portfolios and their practices in measuring and managing risk. Such disclosures should make banks more transparent to financial markets, thereby improving market discipline.Taken together, these three pillars provide a broad and coherent framework for linking regulatory capital to risk, for improving internal risk measurement and management, and for enhancing supervisory and market discipline at large, complex, and internationally active banks. The three pillars build on the economic capital and other risk-management approaches of well-managed banks and better align regulatory and supervisory practices with the way the best-run banks are actually managed. As a result, Basel II will be better able than the current system to adapt over time to innovations in banking and markets. In addition, Basel II sets standards for risk measurement and management and for related disclosures that will give banks ongoing incentives to improve their practices in these areas. Indeed, we have already seen significant progress in risk measurement and management at many banks in the United States and elsewhere as a result of the Basel II development process. More progress can be expected as we move forward.The Need for Ongoing Dialogue and FlexibilityBasel II has the potential to provide significant benefits, but any policy change as fundamental as Basel II inevitably creates uncertainties and raises difficult and complex tradeoffs. Successfully dealing with these challenges requires that the banking agencies, the industry, and other stakeholders maintain a frank and ongoing exchange of views and remain flexible and open-minded as we tackle difficult issues.In this spirit, I urge the industry and other interested parties to comment thoroughly on the Basel II Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR), proposed supervisory guidance that will come out in the near future, and the upcoming proposed changes to Basel I that would apply to the vast majority of banks not subject to Basel II. In an effort to aid this process, I would like to touch on a number of concerns that have been raised regarding Basel II.I understand these concerns. We must recognize, however, that the Basel II proposal is complex for the good reason that modern risk measurement and risk management are inherently complex activities. Indeed, some commenters have argued that Basel II is overly simplistic in certain areas. The draft proposals also represent many judgments about how best to deal with sometimes competing objectives. On the one hand, the system must be enforceable and it must allow for reasonable comparability of regulatory capital ratios across large, complex, and diverse institutions. Thus, some standardization is required. Regulators and supervisors also owe it to the industry and other market participants to be as clear as possible about what we mean by such core concepts as the probability of default and loss given default and about our expectations for how banks go about estimating such parameters.On the other hand, the diversity of practices across banking organizations, the absence of any single, definitive \"best practice,\" and the need to provide strong incentives for improving risk measurement and management require that the system be flexible enough to allow the exercise of judgment by supervisors and bankers. This need for flexibility and the use of judgment is the major reason that we have long emphasized that the supervisory reviews in Pillar 2 are a necessary complement to the explicit minimum regulatory capital requirements set forth in Pillar 1.Naturally, we would like to see the framework implemented as cost-effectively as possible. The desire to avoid unnecessary regulatory costs is another reason why we have tried to build Basel II on what banks are already doing. However, Basel II does ask banks to make some infrastructure investments whose primary purpose is to help supervisors validate and compare banks\\' systems--investments that many banks would not otherwise make. Feedback from the industry regarding our proposals in this area would be very helpful.A key mechanism in Basel II for balancing the inevitable tensions that arise when attempting to achieve sometimes competing objectives is the so-called use test. Under the use test, the systems and processes that a bank uses for regulatory capital purposes must be consistent with those used internally. Note that I use the word \"consistent,\" not \"identical.\" For example, minimum regulatory capital need not equal the economic capital requirements computed internally by a bank, but our intent is that the two will be highly correlated. In addition, Basel II seeks to accommodate a range of risk- measurement and risk-management practices, a range that can change over time. No regulator wants to impose a single definition of \"best practice\" or to set current practice in stone. In light of questions about the use test, I would highlight our desire for specific feedback on how best to implement this important principle.More generally, I hope the industry will work with the agencies to identify aspects of the framework that are neither cost-effective nor supportive of sound risk management. Relative to the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in 2003, the current NPR incorporates many specific suggestions from the industry along these lines. Important examples include the definition of default and the treatments of expected losses, loan-loss reserves, credit derivatives, and securitization. If more adjustments are needed, we are ready to listen and adjust.Another concern that has been expressed regarding Basel II is that it will unfairly tilt the competitive playing field. This concern has two aspects. First, some have argued that the bifurcated application of Basel II within the United States could allow domestic banks that adopt the framework both lower capital charges on certain activities and lower overall regulatory capital requirements compared with other domestic banks. Lower regulatory capital charges would, it has been argued, translate into a cost advantage for adopters that would place non-adopters at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some fear that adopters would use any newly created excess regulatory capital to acquire smaller banks.It is an important principle that differences in capital rules among institutions should not distort financial markets or create artificial competitive advantages for any particular class of banks. With this principle in mind, the Federal Reserve has conducted research on the potential competitive impacts of Basel II, and all of the U.S. banking agencies have received comments from many sources. Based on this information, the banking agencies have announced their intention to propose revisions to the existing Basel I capital standards that would aim to mitigate competitive inequities. Proposals should be released in the not-too-distant future, and I urge interested parties to give us specific advice regarding what else we may need to do to reduce any unintended competitive consequences of Basel II.The second competitive equity concern relates to the international consistency with which Basel II will be implemented. Inconsistency in international standards of implementation and enforcement, it is sometimes said, will put internationally active U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage and may also hurt purely domestic U.S. banks vis-à-vis the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks.All bank regulators recognize that achieving international consistency will be a challenge. However, this problem is not really new. Companies operating across national borders, and their supervisors, are familiar with the challenges of complying with sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. Still, we recognize that some international implementation issues will be more complex than those we currently face. U.S. regulators are working hard through the Basel Committee and with individual firms and national supervisors to address international implementation issues. A great deal more effort and cooperation will be needed, but I believe that, as in the past, we can craft an acceptable set of agreements and work out means of resolving future issues.The final concern I will discuss is the worry that Basel II could lead to a substantial decline in minimum regulatory capital requirements at adopting banks. I emphasized earlier that, for supervisors, an overarching lesson from the banking and thrift crises of the late-1980s and early-1990s is the importance of prudent minimum regulatory capital standards. All the banking agencies are committed to this principle.At present, we cannot quantify precisely how much Basel II, once fully implemented, will affect banks\\' risk-based capital requirements relative to Basel I levels. Although our quantitative impact studies have been useful, they have been conducted using bank systems and measurements that generally would not be expected to meet the Basel II standards. We will learn more as the process moves forward, the standards and guidance come into sharper focus, and banks upgrade their risk-management systems.Because of the irreducible uncertainty in this process, the implementation plan set forth in the NPR incorporates extensive safeguards to limit the potential for unintended consequences, including any possibility of a large decline in required capital levels. These safeguards include a minimum one-year parallel run for each bank, during which the bank will calculate what its risk-based capital requirement would be under Basel II, even though its actual requirement will be determined using the Basel I rules. Following the parallel run, each bank will be subject to a transition period of at least three years during which capital floors based on the Basel I rules will ensure that there is no sharp decline in regulatory capital. In addition, the agencies have committed themselves, throughout the transition process and beyond, to continually evaluate the effects of the new framework and to make any needed adjustments to ensure prudent levels of capital. Finally, I would note that, even when Basel II is fully implemented, all banking organizations will continue to be subject to the current minimum leverage-ratio requirement and prompt-corrective-action rules.This step-by-step implementation plan, which all the U.S. banking agencies support, should ensure that banking organizations maintain strong capital positions throughout the transition years and after. Moreover, safety and soundness depends not only on the absolute level of capital in the banking system but on how well that capital is deployed. The Basel II framework should make any given level of bank capital work harder, so to speak, by aligning capital more closely with risks taken, by providing incentives for banks to improve their risk management, and by enhancing market discipline through greater transparency. To reiterate, however, to make that framework achieve what is intended requires getting the details right. Therefore, I once more urge the banking industry and other members of the public to review the NPR and the draft supervisory guidance closely and to provide the agencies with constructive comments on all aspects of the proposed framework.ConclusionIn summary, I believe the time has come to move to the next stages of implementing Basel II. This framework will modernize bank supervision and bring supervisory practice into line with best industry practice. Substantial benefits will ensue--most importantly, a safer and sounder banking system--but uncertainties remain. Satisfactory resolutions of these uncertainties will require hard work and close cooperation among bank regulators, the industry, Congress, and other key players. There is a long way to go, but the Federal Reserve is committed to this task. It is very much in the best interest of all Americans for the next generation of bank capital standards to be as effective as possible in promoting the stability of the U.S. banking and financial system.Footnotes Accurate and timely statistics are fundamental to sound financial and economic decisionmaking in both the private and public sectors. The quality of the economic statistics in the United States is among the best, if not the best, in the world, but that should not make us complacent. The U.S. economy is extremely dynamic, and improvements in our economic statistics should reflect--and measure--that ever-present change.Naturally, markets work best when people are well informed. Business people rely on economic statistics when they make and execute plans for production, investment, and hiring. Academics and researchers around the world also use economic statistics to evaluate alternative models and theories that further our understanding of how the economy and financial markets operate.Reliable and timely economic statistics are crucial to the formulation and evaluation of budgetary and monetary policies. Measuring U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), for example, is an enormously difficult task, but accurate measurements are extremely important for policymakers\\' decisions. An error of just 1/10 percentage point in projections of long-term real GDP growth, for instance, can result in an error of approximately $270 billion in a ten-year budget forecast.Prices are another set of data that are important for monetary policy. The primary responsibility of monetary policy is to ensure that we have a low and stable rate of inflation and the maximum sustainable rate of employment growth. Inaccurate price measurement could result in inaccurate forecasts of the direction of inflation and, thereby, lead to policy choices that are too tight or too accommodative.As a researcher, I find that timely and reliable information is critical for analyzing, measuring, and calibrating the ways in which the various parts of our complex economy operate.Improving the cost-benefit tradeoff for economic statistics has several elements, and I will focus on two in my remarks. The common theme is that innovations in economic statistics must keep pace with innovations in the economy.CIPSEA tackled two important issues. First, the act strengthens the safeguards that protect the confidentiality of information provided by the public. The legislation applies clear and uniform statutory restrictions on the use of confidential statistical information. In particular, information about individuals or organizations acquired for exclusively statistical purposes and under a pledge of confidentiality can be used only for statistical purposes. The act replaced a patchwork of safeguards with consistent tough penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of confidential statistical information.Second, the act authorized the limited sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for statistical purposes. Allowing the agencies to share certain businesses data has improved the accuracy and reliability of economic statistics. In particular, enhanced data sharing among the agencies has improved the ability of the Census Bureau, the BEA, and the BLS to track rapidly changing trends in the U.S. economy. In addition, it has helped to reduce the duplicative paperwork burdens imposed on businesses.Even with the 2002 legislation, however, more can be done to realize the full benefits of data sharing. What I\\'m about to discuss is going to sound very arcane, but it is quite important for the improvement of economic statistics. So please bear with me.The Census Bureau conducts a large number of business surveys the results of which are key inputs into the estimation of the nation\\'s GDP. The Census Bureau selects businesses to survey from a list of establishments called a \"business register.\" The Census Bureau uses tax reports as a way of identifying establishments to include in its business register. It\\'s very important to note that the Census Bureau is not rummaging through individual line items on company tax reports but rather is using the reports only to identify companies for inclusion in its surveys.Meanwhile, every month the BLS conducts a survey of establishments to find out about such things as employment and earnings. The BLS also uses a business register to decide which establishments to contact. However, the BLS register comes from reports filed by firms to state unemployment insurance offices.Here\\'s the rub: In many instances establishments show up as being part of different industries in the two registers. As a result, industry analyses that use survey data on employment or prices from the BLS and survey data on shipments from the Census Bureau may well provide unreliable characterizations of changes in real output and productivity for particular industries.The reason the two business registers have not been harmonized is that current law prevents the BLS from having the same access as the Census Bureau to business identifiers on tax forms. Removing this barrier to sharing such data for statistical purposes would have significant payoffs. Sharing of business registers would help provide for more accurate measures of industry output, compensation, and productivity trends. It would permit the statistical agencies to keep abreast of our dynamic economy by producing statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and it would allow the agencies to correct errors quickly and efficiently. This is especially important for fast-growing and innovative industries such as information technology. Such improvements would improve our ability to perceive emerging trends in the economy and more accurately forecast economic activity.The BEA, the statistical agency responsible for estimating GDP and the other components of the national income and product accounts, cannot currently access information from business taxes. Allowing the BEA to obtain certain aggregate numbers from business tax returns for statistical purposes would let the BEA significantly improve its estimates of the role of noncorporate businesses in the economy. This is important, in part, because many entrepreneurial start-up firms, which are a source of dynamism in the economy, begin their lives organized as sole proprietorships or partnerships--that is, not as corporations. Permitting the BEA to use limited business tax information for statistical purposes could appreciably improve the measurement of this vibrant part of the economy and, once again, improve our ability to spot new trends and forecast economic activity. Of course, in obtaining this information, the BEA would continue to be subject to the strict confidentiality requirements and disclosure penalties embodied in CIPSEA. Protecting data privacy is of utmost concern, and I would certainly not suggest changes that would compromise confidentiality.I now would like to turn to the second element I want to emphasize in improving the cost-benefit trade off for economic statistics, namely, that the statistical agencies hasten their move toward a more effective allocation of current resources. The usefulness of economic statistics--the benefit side of the cost-benefit tradeoff--is the key. The economy is constantly changing. In the past, there has been a tendency to persist in a full and expensive compilation of detailed data for heretofore cutting-edge industries far beyond the time at which those industries stopped being prominent in the economy. Consequently, statistical agencies need to be constantly assessing whether their data reflect the changes--that is, you don\\'t want to be spending all your resources on collecting information about buggy whips in the age of the automobile.An innovative economy needs to have innovative statistics. This means that the statistical agencies need to be on the cutting edge in measuring the most dynamic parts of the economy. Typically, we think of dynamism in terms of those segments of the economy--usually industries and sometimes occupations--where output or employment are growing rapidly. But output and employment growth are not the only criteria for dynamism. Rapid increases in what economists call \"intangible capital\" are another characteristic of dynamic firms. This includes such things as expenditures on scientific research and development (R&D) as well as the breakthrough improvements to businesses processes that have made so many American companies successful. Dynamic firms are also characterized by the proliferation of new products that incorporate large amounts of R&D as well as by rapid improvements in the quality of products.These brisk gains in intangible capital and the quality of products are important because they are an important source of productivity growth. In other words, dynamic firms are the ones making the largest contributions to the nation\\'s overall productivity growth, which is, at bottom, the fundamental source of rising standards of living. Accordingly, it is important that the economic statistical system do a good job of measuring not only output and employment growth but also intangibles, new cutting-edge products, and quality changes.Given the speed and short histories of many of these changes and innovations, however, it is particularly challenging to create statistics for new and dynamic parts of the economy that will be as reliable as those in the more traditional sectors. We need to be mindful of the difficult burden that the statistical agencies face in trying to maintain their very high standards for quality in such areas.I\\'ll start with the way in which the Census Bureau classifies the outputs of the economy into particular categories for data collection purposes. The Census Bureau creates a list of so-called \"product codes\" that identify the types of goods and services that companies produce and sell. They group similar products into larger categories, but innovations in the economy have made those groupings woefully out of date.For the past several years, the Census Bureau has been developing more extensive product codes for services, and that effort is to be applauded. It is precisely the right response to a dynamic economy in which services have become much more important over time. In addition, improving product codes for communications equipment and other high-tech components of manufacturing also should be given high priority.Now, contrast this with the product code called \"data communications equipment.\" Unlike \"broadcast, studio, and related equipment,\" there are no break-downs into subcategories. Such leading-edge products as large enterprise routers, gateways, bridges, and terminal servers are combined into a single category. In 2004, shipments from manufacturers of data communications equipment totaled more than $10-1/2 billion. The current system of product codes thus provides as much information about a well-established technology with shipments worth $18 million as a grouping of rapidly changing technology products with shipments worth more than $10-1/2 billion.Similarly, the current system of product codes tell us as much about shipments of public pay telephone as it does about shipments of cellular system equipment--an industry that is more than 230 times larger ($43 million versus nearly $10 billion). The task of updating product lists is resource intensive and time consuming, but it is critical to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of developments in the most vibrant sectors of our economy.In addition to updating product codes to reflect change, another data challenge of our dynamic economy is to adjust the prices of high-tech equipment for improvements in quality. By adjusting for quality, I mean price statistics that recognize that a computer that costs $1,000 today is several times more powerful than a computer that cost $1,000 ten years ago. Accordingly, after taking account of the quality improvements, one can say that today\\'s computers cost far less than computers cost ten years ago because you get much more for your money today. Government price data for computers do try to adjust for quality improvements, and the agencies must be applauded for undertaking such adjustments to keep pace with innovations in the economy.Summary and Conclusion\\nAs I noted in my introduction, the U.S. enjoys among the best, if not the best, economic statistics in the world. My remarks have been focused on building on that excellent foundation using a cost-benefit framework. Innovations in economic statistics must keep pace with innovations in the economy. Barriers to useful sharing of information across statistical agencies should be removed to reduce costs and enhance benefits, but in no way should we compromise the high standards of privacy protection embodied in CIPSEA and other statutes. And allocating resources to better measure the most dynamic parts of the economy will help us get the most bang per buck in economic statistics by enhancing our ability to spot trends and improve forecasts of the direction of the economy.Policymakers, businesses, and average Americans are able to make better decisions with economic statistics that reflect the latest innovations in the economy. Achieving an innovation-sensitive statistical system can be fostered by removing legislative barriers that impose costs on the system with no (or little) benefit. Also, statistical agencies need to be nimble at recognizing and responding promptly to emerging trends in the structure of the economy. One way of achieving nimbleness is by getting feedback from users in government, in the academy and in business. The Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee and the BEA advisory committee are good examples of statistical agencies trying to increase the amount of feedback they receive. And organizations like the National Association for Business Economics can communicate more widely the importance of innovative statistics for a dynamic economy. Together we can try to fix the speedometer and clear the fog from the windshield to improve both public and private decisionmaking.Footnotes I appreciate the opportunity to join you this evening to recognize the successes of an impressive list of community revitalization projects. Having observed the revitalization of Washington, D.C., over a number of years, I am particularly pleased to be here at the Tivoli Theatre and see first-hand the work that has been done to restore this historic theater and bring new activity and investment to the Columbia Heights neighborhood.As I look around, it is hard to believe that such an architectural gem sat vacant for some twenty-eight years. The restoration of the Tivoli honors the past while helping serve the residential, commercial, retail, and cultural needs of Columbia Heights residents. It is a fine example of the transformative power of investments in older, urban neighborhoods. Projects such as this would not be possible without the strategic vision and commitment of community, business, and government leaders. It is that vision we are here to celebrate this evening.I would like to begin by offering a review of the overall economic climate today and the prospects for business investment generally. Then, to borrow a phrase from Social Compact, I will \"drill down\" to highlight a number of the elements that I believe are important in making sound investment decisions, particularly in underserved areas of our inner cities. Finally, I will offer a few other observations about the state of the community development industry as I see it.Macroeconomic ConditionsThe recent news on the U.S. economy has been, on the whole, quite positive. Adjusted for inflation, gross domestic product increased at a brisk rate in the first quarter of the year. Gains in consumer spending and business investment were particularly strong. To be sure, most forecasters are expecting the overall pace of economic activity to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters as housing markets gradually cool and the delayed effects of higher interest rates and energy prices temper domestic demand. However, with economic activity abroad expanding at a solid pace, export sales should provide some support for domestic production.On balance, the outlook for business investment should remain quite favorable even as the pace of overall activity moderates. Against a backdrop of sustained growth in sales, businesses should be well positioned to undertake potentially profitable projects. They have enjoyed robust earnings for the past several years, and their balance sheets are strong. The reports on first-quarter earnings have been quite positive, and available measures of credit quality, such as credit ratings and loan defaults, show few signs of stress.Financing costs have moved up since last fall, but the Federal Reserve’s most recent survey of bank lending practices, which was conducted in April, indicates that domestic banks are noticing increases in requests for business loans. They also indicated an increased willingness to supply business loans in an environment of brisk competition from other lenders, a liquid secondary market for business loans, and an increased tolerance for risk. In that regard, research conducted by Federal Reserve economists notes that more banks are offering loans to businesses in markets where the banks do not have branch offices; the research suggests that new technology has spurred competition for some types of small business lending in recent years. More broadly, businesses currently have access to plentiful debt and equity financing from a variety of sources in addition to banks.The challenge that community development practitioners face in working with businesses looking for new investment opportunities is to demonstrate through careful analysis that promising inner-city neighborhoods can be good investments. That the current overall conditions for business investment are positive is thus good news for the work of Social Compact and its partners.The Importance of Data to Investment DecisionsCommunity development has come a long way since I first began following it as a young congressional staffer thirty-five years ago. Whereas government programs once funded the bulk of inner-city development, public-private partnerships now dominate. In many places, community-based organizations have been able to \"jump start\" markets by facilitating private investment. The focus of neighborhood revitalization has shifted increasingly toward market-based approaches. In that regard, organizations that seek to promote neighborhood revitalization must focus on what makes their projects competitive.Social Compact is perhaps best known for its focus on one important input into the investment process--information. Timely and accurate information is what project planners need to bring entrepreneurs, investors, and lenders together to objectively assess the proposed undertaking. Having been a banker, I know very well how much more efficient the process can be when decisionmakers are presented with a clear assessment of the projected returns and a balanced analysis of risk.Another related feature of market-based investment decisions is the importance of built-in measures of accountability. Hard data on results are important in establishing the credibility of projects. With data, and results, such investments can also serve as catalysts for additional private investment in underserved areas. A number of methods have been derived for evaluating the effectiveness of community development projects. The one with which I am most familiar, through my work on the board of NeighborWorks America, is the Success Measures Data System. This system uses more than forty indicators and a variety of data-collection tools--including surveys, interviews, and focus groups--to quantify the effects of housing, economic development, and community building programs at the personal, organizational, and community levels. This array of tools allows NeighborWorks to measure success not just quantitatively but qualitatively, looking beyond the numbers to detect sustainable positive change. The underlying philosophy is that a community development initiative cannot be judged successful just because it puts a family in a home; rather, it must be able to say that, by doing so, it has improved the community, the family’s quality of life, and the family’s economic potential.These data are also useful to corporate partners insofar as they demonstrate business performance against internal goals and commitment to the community. Businesses recognize that demonstrable success enhances their reputation, increases brand recognition, and improves their ability to compete successfully for future partnership opportunities. Thus, being able to determine the return on a business’ investment in a community development initiative in both quantitative and qualitative terms is the next logical step in attracting further private investment.But the social and economic needs of our inner-city neighborhoods extend beyond business investment. Effective partnerships with local officials and community leaders are another key element of the revitalization process. At the state and local levels, public officials contribute to the attractiveness of investment conditions by maintaining sound fiscal policies. These policies allow local officials to take the lead from Social Compact and begin to market local neighborhoods using the analysis that demonstrates the buying-power residing within these more challenging neighborhoods. Their willingness to address other neighborhood needs, such as housing, infrastructure, education, health care, and other social supports will also be important to investors.In general, when community development is a cooperative effort, it can lead to more sustainable outcomes along both economic and social dimensions. While the return on investment can be a sufficient gauge of their economic success, success in broader terms can be viewed by assessing the commitment of all segments of the community to the goal of revitalization. Moreover, the benefits of such cooperative actions are not always readily measurable in dollars and cents. Greater opportunities in local neighborhoods evidence themselves through better schools and stronger ties forged within the local community.The Importance of VisionSo far, my remarks have focused on the tangible aspects of planning and investment. But I do not want to leave out a critical element that is perhaps impossible to measure but underlies each of your undertakings. That element is vision. The Washington Post has reported that when Joe Horning walked through this theater eight years ago, he was surrounded by broken windows, rotted floor boards, and leaks in the roof. That’s what he saw. But what he envisioned was quite different. He envisioned a beautifully restored theater that would not only serve the community but, more important, also serve as a symbol that Columbia Heights could be revitalized.Indeed, in the past eight years, that vision has been realized, with Columbia Heights today a vibrant and viable neighborhood. As in similar neighborhoods in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States, there is much to celebrate in the results of community investments. The increase in street traffic and economic activity makes the neighborhood a livelier and safer place. Property values are rising, and that allows homeowners here to experience the wealth-building power of homeownership that their peers in more-affluent areas have experienced for years. It also enables them to invest in the rehabilitation of their homes. This additional investment improves the look and feel of the entire neighborhood. Of course, the higher home prices and rents that result from the increased desirability of this neighborhood also limit the availability of affordable housing. These pressures on the market are being felt here in the Washington metropolitan area as well as in other expanding real estate markets.The question of gentrification in Columbia Heights was interestingly portrayed in the Washington Post earlier this month through the eyes of a pair of twelve-year old girls who have grown up in this neighborhood. The girls entered a citywide essay contest on gentrification, a word that they had not previously known, and observed very keenly the effects of the development going on around them. They noted their increased feeling of safety as they walked to and from school thanks to the rehabilitation of previously vacant rowhouses and the exciting new diversity of individuals living in their neighborhoods. But they also missed the friends whose families were forced to move out of the neighborhood when it became too expensive to stay. They were saddened by the loss of some of the smaller shops that will be replaced by larger retailers. In the end, the girls concluded that gentrification is a complicated issue, and its results are \"not always bad and not always good.\"I would have to agree that gentrification is complicated and requires thorough thought and planning as neighborhood revitalization strategies are developed. Many strategies are being developed at the local level to address the increasing need for affordable housing; these strategies include housing trust funds, private activity bonds, and community land trusts, to name just a few. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is currently studying patterns of home price changes and gentrification in neighborhoods here in Washington, D.C. The work is intended to assist city governments, community development corporations, and funders in anticipating and mitigating the effects of gentrification on lower-income residents. As difficult as the challenges seem, I am confident that if policymakers, researchers, and public and private community development practitioners continue to work together, they will be able to balance new investments with strategies to encourage affordable housing options for sustainable and equitable community development.In the meantime, my colleagues at the Board of Governors and I are committed to sustaining a noninflationary economic expansion and a healthy financial system, which should create a solid foundation for the development of new business opportunities. Of course, although a strong economy and vibrant capital markets are necessary to establish a solid market-based foundation for economic development, they are not sufficient. Successful community development projects require vision, commitment, tough choices, and hard work. Indeed, these are the qualities that each of the projects honored here tonight share. I am pleased to be able to give my personal congratulations to tonight’s honorees and to Social Compact for leading the way in the effort to uncover the market potential of inner-city neighborhoods through innovation, risk taking, and the sharing of results. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent. Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Chairman Hagel, Senator Dodd, and members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the role of hedge funds in the capital markets. In my remarks today, I will discuss the increasing importance of that role, the public policy issues associated with it, and what the Federal Reserve has been doing to address concerns about potential systemic risks from hedge funds’ activities.\\nRole of Hedge Funds in the Capital MarketsThe role that hedge funds are playing in capital markets cannot be quantified with any precision. A fundamental problem is that the definition of a hedge fund is imprecise, and distinctions between hedge funds and other types of funds are increasingly arbitrary. Hedge funds often are characterized as unregulated private funds that can take on significant leverage and employ complex trading strategies using derivatives or other new financial instruments. Private equity funds are usually not considered hedge funds, yet they are typically unregulated and often leverage significantly the companies in which they invest. Likewise, traditional asset managers more and more are using derivatives or are investing in structured securities that allow them to take on leverage or establish short positions.\\nAlthough several databases on hedge funds are compiled by private vendors, they cover only the hedge funds that voluntarily provide data.1 Consequently, the data are not comprehensive. Furthermore, because the funds that choose to report may not be representative of the total population of hedge funds, generalizations based on these databases may be misleading. Data collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from registered advisers to hedge funds are not comprehensive either. The primary purpose of registration is to protect investors by discouraging hedge fund fraud. The SEC does not require an adviser to a hedge fund, regardless of how large it is, to register if the fund does not permit investors to redeem their interests within two years of purchasing them.2 While registration of advisers of such funds may well be unnecessary to discourage fraud, the exclusion from the database of funds with long lock-up periods makes the data less useful for quantifying the role that hedge funds are playing in the capital markets.\\nEven if a fund is included in a private database or its adviser is registered with the SEC, the information available is quite limited. The only quantitative information that the SEC currently collects is total assets under management. Private databases typically provide assets under management as well as some limited information on how the assets are allocated among investment strategies, but they do not provide detailed balance sheets. Some databases provide information on funds’ use of leverage, but their definition of leverage is often unclear. As hedge funds and other market participants increasingly use financial products such as derivatives and securitized assets that embed leverage, conventional measures of leverage have become much less useful. More meaningful economic measures of leverage are complex and highly sensitive to assumptions about the liquidity of the markets in which financial instruments can be sold or hedged.3\\nAlthough the role of hedge funds in the capital markets cannot be precisely quantified, the growing importance of that role is clear. Total assets under management are usually reported to exceed $1 trillion.4 Furthermore, hedge funds can leverage those assets through borrowing money and through their use of derivatives, short positions, and structured securities. Their market impact is further magnified by the extremely active trading of some hedge funds. The trading volumes of these funds reportedly account for significant shares of total trading volumes in some segments of fixed income, equity, and derivatives markets.5\\nIn various capital markets, hedge funds clearly are increasingly consequential as providers of liquidity and absorbers of risk. For example, a study of the markets in U.S. dollar interest rate options indicated that participants viewed hedge funds as a significant stabilizing force. In particular, when the options and other fixed income markets were under stress in the summer of 2003, the willingness of hedge funds to sell options following a spike in options prices helped restore market liquidity and limit losses to derivatives dealers and investors in fixed-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.6 Hedge funds reportedly are significant buyers of the riskier equity and subordinated tranches of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and of asset-backed securities, including securities backed by nonconforming residential mortgages.7\\nAt the same time, however, the growing role of hedge funds has given rise to public policy concerns. These include concerns about whether hedge fund investors can protect themselves adequately from the risks associated with such investments, whether hedge fund leverage is being constrained effectively, and what potential risks the funds pose to the financial system if their leverage becomes excessive.\\nInvestor ProtectionHedge funds and their investment advisers historically were exempt from most provisions of the federal securities laws.8 Those laws effectively allow only institutions and relatively wealthy individuals to invest in hedge funds. Such investors arguably are in a position to protect themselves from the risks associated with hedge funds.9 However, in recent years hedge funds reportedly have been marketed increasingly to a less wealthy clientele. Furthermore, pension funds, many of whose beneficiaries are not wealthy, have increased investments in hedge funds.\\nConcerns about the potential direct and indirect exposures of less wealthy investors from hedge fund investments and hedge fund fraud contributed to the SEC’s decision in December 2004 to require many advisers to hedge funds that are offered to U.S. investors to register with the commission.\\nThe SEC believes that the examination of registered hedge fund advisers will deter fraud. But fraud is very difficult to uncover, even through on-site examinations.10 Therefore, it is critical that investors do not view the SEC registration of advisers as an effective substitute for their own due diligence in selecting funds and their own monitoring of hedge fund performance. Most institutional investors probably understand this well. In a survey several years ago of U.S. endowments and foundations, 70 percent of the respondents said that a hedge fund adviser’s registration or lack of registration with the SEC had no effect on their decision about whether or not to invest because the institutions conducted their own due diligence.11\\nIn the case of pension funds, sponsors and pension fund regulators should ensure that pension funds conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to all their investments, not just their investments in hedge funds. Pension funds and other institutional investors seem to have a growing appetite for a variety of alternatives to holding stocks and bonds, including real estate, private equity and commodities, and investments in hedge funds are only one means of gaining exposures to those alternative assets. The registration of hedge fund advisers simply cannot protect pension fund beneficiaries from the failures of plan sponsors to carry out their fiduciary responsibilities.\\nAs for individual investors, the income and wealth criteria that define eligible investors in hedge funds unavoidably are a crude test for sophistication.12 If individuals with relatively little wealth increasingly become the victims of hedge fund fraud, it may become appropriate to tighten the criteria for an individual to be considered an eligible investor.\\nExcessive Leverage and Systemic RiskThe near failure of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in September 1998 illustrated the potential for a large hedge fund to become excessively leveraged and raised concerns that a forced liquidation of large positions held by a highly leveraged institution would create systemic risk by exacerbating market volatility and illiquidity. In our market-based economy, the primary mechanism that regulates firms’ leverage is the market discipline imposed by creditors and counterparties. Even when the government has oversight of leverage, as in the case of banks and broker-dealers, such oversight is intended to supplement market discipline rather than to replace it. In the case of LTCM, however, market discipline broke down.\\nIn the wake of the LTCM episode, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets considered how best to constrain excessive leverage by hedge funds. The Working Group concluded that hedge funds’ leverage could be constrained most effectively by promoting measures that enhance market discipline by improving credit risk management by hedge funds’ counterparties and creditors, nearly all of which are regulated banks and securities firms.13 The Working Group termed this approach “indirect regulation” of hedge funds. The Working Group considered the alternative of direct government regulation of hedge funds, but it concluded that developing a regulatory regime for hedge funds would present formidable challenges in terms of cost and effectiveness. It believed that indirect regulation would address concerns about systemic risks from hedge funds most effectively and would avoid the potential attendant costs of direct regulation.14\\nThe Federal Reserve and Hedge FundsThe President’s Working Group made a series of recommendations for improving market discipline on hedge funds. These included recommendations for improvements in credit risk management practices by the banks and securities firms that are hedge funds’ counterparties and creditors and improvements in supervisory oversight of those banks and securities firms. As a regulator of banks and bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve has worked with other domestic and international regulators to implement the necessary improvements in supervisory oversight. Regulatory cooperation is essential in this area because hedge funds’ principal creditors and counterparties include foreign banks as well as U.S. banks and securities firms.\\nIn January 1999, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a set of recommendations for sound practices for managing counterparty credit risks to hedge funds and other highly leveraged institutions. Around the same time, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Treasury Department encouraged a group of twelve major banks and securities firms to form a Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG), which in July 1999 issued its own complementary recommendations for improving counterparty risk management practices.15\\nThe BCBS sound practices have been incorporated into Federal Reserve supervisory guidance and examination procedures applicable to banks’ capital market activities. In general terms, routine supervisory reviews of counterparty risk management practices with respect to hedge funds and other counterparties seek to ensure that banks (1) perform appropriate due diligence in assessing the business, risk exposures, and credit standing of their counterparties; (2) establish, monitor, and enforce appropriate quantitative risk exposure limits for each of their counterparties; (3) use appropriate systems to measure and manage counterparty credit risk; and (4) deploy appropriate internal controls to ensure the integrity of their processes for managing counterparty credit risk. Besides conducting routine reviews and continually monitoring counterparty credit exposures, the Federal Reserve periodically performs targeted reviews of the credit risk management practices of banks that are major hedge fund counterparties. These targeted reviews examine in depth the banks’ practices against the BCBS and Federal Reserve sound practices guidance and the CRMPG recommendations.\\nAccording to supervisors and most market participants, counterparty risk management has improved significantly since the LTCM episode in 1998. However, since that time, hedge funds have greatly expanded their activities and strategies in an environment of intense competition for hedge fund business among banks and securities firms. Furthermore, some hedge funds are among the most active investors in new, more-complex structured financial products, for which valuation and risk measurement are challenging both to the funds themselves and to their counterparties. Counterparties and supervisors need to ensure that competitive pressures do not result in any significant weakening of counterparty risk management and that risk management practices are evolving as necessary to address the increasing complexity of the financial instruments used by hedge funds.\\nThe Federal Reserve has also sought to limit hedge funds’ potential to be a source of systemic risk by ensuring that the clearing and settlement infrastructure that supports the markets in which the funds trade is robust. Very active trading by hedge funds has contributed significantly to the extraordinary growth in the past several years of the markets for credit derivatives. A July 2005 report by a new Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG II) called attention to the fact that the clearing and settlement infrastructure for credit derivatives (and over-the-counter derivatives generally) had not kept pace with the volume of trading.16 In particular, a backlog of unsigned trade confirmations was growing, and the acceptance by dealers of assignments of trades by one counterparty without the prior consent of the other, despite trade documentation requirements for such consent, was becoming widespread.\\nTo address these and other concerns about the clearing and settlement of credit derivatives, in September 2005 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York brought together fourteen major U.S. and foreign derivatives dealers and their supervisors. The supervisors collectively made clear their concerns about the risks created by the infrastructure weaknesses and asked the dealers to develop plans to address those concerns. With supervisors providing common incentives for the collective actions that were necessary, the dealers have made remarkable progress since last September. The practice of unauthorized assignments has almost ceased, and dealers are now expeditiously responding to requests for the authorization of assignments. For the fourteen dealers as a group, total credit derivative confirmations outstanding for more than thirty days fell 70 percent between September 2005 and March 2006. The reduction in outstanding confirmations was made possible in part by more widespread and intensive use of an electronic confirmation-processing system operated by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The dealers have worked with their largest and most active clients, most of which are hedge funds, to ensure that they can electronically confirm trades in credit derivatives. By March 2006, 69 percent of the fourteen dealers’ credit derivatives trades were being confirmed electronically, up from 47 percent last September.\\nSupervisors and market participants agree that further progress is needed, and in March the fourteen dealers committed themselves to achieving by October 31, 2006, a “steady state” position for the industry.17 The steady state will involve (1) the creation of a largely electronic marketplace in which all trades that can be processed electronically will be; (2) the creation by DTCC of an industry trade information warehouse and support infrastructure to standardize and automate processing of events throughout each contracts’s life; (3) new processing standards for those trades that cannot be confirmed electronically; and (4) the creation of an automated platform to support notifications and consents with respect to trade assignments. The principal trade association for the hedge fund industry has stated its support for plans embodied in the dealers’ commitments.18 \\nSummaryHedge funds clearly are becoming more important in the capital markets as sources of liquidity and holders and managers of risk. But as their importance has grown, so too have concerns about investor protection and systemic risk. The SEC believes that the examination of registered hedge advisers will deter fraud. But investors must not view SEC regulation of advisers as an effective substitute for their own due diligence in selecting funds and their own monitoring of hedge fund performance.\\nAfter the LTCM episode, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets considered how best to address concerns about potential systemic risks from excessive hedge fund leverage. The Working Group concluded that hedge funds’ leverage could be constrained most effectively by promoting measures that enhance market discipline by improving credit risk management by funds’ counterparties and creditors, nearly all of which are regulated banks and securities firms. The Working Group considered the alternative of direct government regulation of hedge funds but concluded that it would be more costly and would be less effective than an approach focused on strengthening market discipline.\\nThe Federal Reserve has been seeking to ensure appropriate market discipline on hedge funds by working with other regulators to promote effective counterparty risk management by hedge funds’ counterparties and creditors. It has also sought to limit the potential for hedge funds to be a source of systemic risk by ensuring that the clearing and settlement infrastructure that supports the markets in which they trade is robust.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1.\\xa0 Examples of hedge fund databases include Trading Advisors Selection System (TASS), Centre for International Securities and Derivatives Markets (CISDM) Hedge Fund Database, and Hedge Fund Research Database. \\xa0Return to text\\n2.\\xa0 The commission decided not to require such funds to register because it had not encountered significant problems with fraud at private equity or venture capital funds, which are similar in some respects to hedge funds but usually require investors to make long-term commitments of capital. \\xa0Return to text\\n3.\\xa0 For a discussion of the definition and construction of economically meaningful measures of leverage, see appendix A in Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (1999), Improving Counterparty Risk Management Practices (New York: CRMPG, June). \\xa0Return to text\\n4.\\xa0 Some of these estimates may double count investments in funds of funds.

My remarks will emphasize the importance of financial literacy, both as a source of better decisionmaking by consumers and as a means of improving the functioning of financial markets. I will also highlight various Federal Reserve System initiatives to promote financial education and address some of the opportunities and challenges that policymakers and financial educators face as they seek to improve financial literacy.\\nTechnological advances have dramatically transformed the provision of financial services in our economy. Notably, increasingly sophisticated information technologies enable lenders to collect and process data necessary to evaluate and price risk much more efficiently than in the past. For example, the expanded use of credit-scoring models, by reducing the costs of making loans and by increasing the range of assets that can be securitized, has facilitated greater extension of credit to a larger group of borrowers. Indeed, we have seen an increasingly wide array of products being offered to consumers across a range of incomes, leading to what has been called the democratization of credit. Likewise, innovation has enhanced financial services, such as banking services, and increased the variety of financial products available to investors.\\nEven as the availability of credit has increased, so has the range of potential providers. In particular, in recent years, the number of nonbank entities providing credit products and other financial services has increased significantly. Data from a recent paper on alternative providers of financial services revealed that, between 1996 and 2001, the number of nonbank check-cashing establishments doubled in the United States. Payday lending outlets, a source of credit that was almost non-existent a decade ago, now number more than 10,0001. Data from the Federal Reserve Board’s 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that the share of households with a loan from a finance company increased from 13 percent of households in 1992 to 25 percent of households in 20042. While many of these providers cater to low- and moderate-income consumers, their customers include people with a wide range of incomes and financial experience3. Clearly, to choose wisely from the variety of products and providers available, consumers must have the financial knowledge to navigate today’s increasingly complex financial services marketplace. Consumers with the necessary skills to make informed financial decisions about purchasing a home, financing an education or their retirement, or starting a business will almost certainly be economically better off than those lacking those vital skills.\\nInformed financial decisionmaking is also vital for the healthy functioning of financial markets. Like any other businesses, financial service firms will provide better products at better prices when they are subject to market pressures imposed on them by informed consumers. Regulators have an important role in helping to ensure that financial service companies provide necessary information to their customers, but such information is of value only to the extent that it can be understood and applied by potential users of these services. Market competition among financial providers for the business of informed consumers is, in my judgment, the best mechanism for promoting the provision of better, lower-cost financial products.\\nResearch on the Impact of Financial Education\\nResearch suggests that financial education can help consumers make better choices. For example, for many decades, various nonprofit organizations have offered homebuying programs and credit counseling to improve consumers’ financial management skills and reduce the risk of default or delinquency. Research on the effectiveness of these programs has generally associated financial counseling with improvements in consumers’ credit management. For example, one study that analyzed nearly 40,000 affordable mortgage loans targeted to lower-income borrowers found that counseling before the purchase of a home reduced ninety-day delinquency rates by 19 percent on average4. This study also documented a 34 percent reduction in mortgage delinquency rates among borrowers who received individual counseling rather than classroom or telephone instruction.\\nIn another study, researchers found that credit counseling had a positive effect on creditworthiness, especially for individuals with the lowest credit scores. They examined credit bureau data on 14,000 recipients of one-on-one credit counseling and found that, over a three-year period, these borrowers reported reduced debt levels and delinquency rates5. Another, preliminary study found that after receiving on-line instruction in credit management new or recently delinquent credit cardholders were more likely to pay on time and to have lower revolving balances6.\\nOther research has looked at the link between financial knowledge and broader financial management skills. For example, one study examined the relationship between financial knowledge and financial behavior such as cashflow management, savings, and investing. Overall, the study found a significant correlation between the level of financial knowledge and good financial management practices. Individuals who were familiar with financial concepts and products were found to be more likely to balance their checkbook every month, budget for savings, and hold investment accounts7. Similarly, another study on consumer creditworthiness and consumer literacy determined that financial knowledge is the single best predictor of behaviors, such as budgeting, saving, and shopping responsibly, that translated into positive outcomes on credit bureau reports. This study also found that the main sources of knowledge were bad experiences, school instruction, and other education8.\\nThe Federal Reserve System’s Commitment to Financial Literacy\\nThe Federal Reserve System has long recognized the value of economic and financial education for producing better-informed citizens and consumers. Broadly, our financial education activities fall into five primary categories: (1) increasing access to information about financial products and services, (2) promoting awareness of the importance of financial literacy, (3) collaborating with educational and community organizations, (4) supporting research and identifying best practices, and (5) providing financial education for its own employees. I will briefly comment on each of these.\\nIncreasing Access to Information about Financial Products and Services\\nOne important means by which the Federal Reserve helps consumers make better informed financial decisions is through its consumer protection rule-writing. For example, in pursuit of the goals set by the Congress, our regulations require the disclosure of specific information on terms and fees associated with credit and deposit accounts. The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (as implemented by Regulation Z) requires uniform methods for computing the cost of credit and for disclosing terms on a broad range of credit products--credit cards and other lines of credit, automobile loans, student loans, and home-purchase and other home-secured loans. In addition, the Truth in Savings Act, implemented by Regulation DD, requires uniform disclosure of certain cost information on deposit accounts, including the annual percentage yield. These disclosures provide consumers with the essential information they need to assess the costs and benefits of financial services offered by different providers. Standardization of disclosures allows for comparison among similar products and thus provides consumers with an important shopping tool.\\nOne of the challenges of creating effective disclosures is presenting information so that it is as accessible and understandable as possible. To address this issue, we conduct focus groups and consumer testing to inform the rule-writing process. Because regulatory language can be quite technical, the Federal Reserve also publishes numerous brochures that explain the terminology and consumers’ rights in straightforward terms or provide useful information on particular areas of concern, such as predatory lending and identity theft. Focus groups convened over the years have found that the Federal Reserve’s consumer brochures were regarded as high-quality, unbiased publications. We have also found that counselors and educators often use our brochures when teaching about financial products and services.\\nPromoting Awareness of the Importance of Financial Education and Literacy\\nThe Federal Reserve System has also worked to promote awareness of the importance of financial education and literacy. In May 2003, the Board and the twelve Reserve Banks participated in a national campaign to call attention to the value of personal financial education and the wide variety of financial literacy tools and resources available. This multi-media initiative, entitled \"There’s a Lot to Learn about Money,\" included a public service announcement and a toll-free number for obtaining financial education resources. Consumers were also directed to our education website, www.federalreserveeducation.org, to obtain more-substantive information, ranging from materials about personal financial literacy to interactive tools for economic education. The website links to a wide variety of financial education resources at the national, regional, and local levels.\\nCollaborating with Educational and Community Organizations\\nA third piece of the Federal Reserve’s financial education effort is its collaboration with a wide range of educational and community organizations. Staff members from the Federal Reserve Board advise and assist national organizations such as the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, the Conference of Mayors’ DollarWi$e Campaign, Operation HOPE, the American Savings Education Council, and America Saves on the development of policies, programs, and partnerships.\\nThe Federal Reserve Banks also join with regional organizations to address financial education needs. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has worked with community financial educators to form regional networks that combine resources and share best practices. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago sponsors \"MoneySmart Week,\" partnering with banks, businesses, government agencies, schools, community organizations, and libraries to host activities designed to help consumers learn how to manage money. The Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco and Minneapolis have worked with leaders in the Native American community to develop financial education materials. As you are aware, the Federal Reserve Board also participates in the federal government’s Financial Literacy and Education Commission.\\nCollaboration with outside organizations also plays a central role in the Federal Reserve’s support for broader economic education. We believe that a better understanding of how the economy works promotes both better citizenship and greater personal economic success. As one means of supporting this objective, Reserve Bank staff members advise high-school teachers on ways to help students understand economics. Perhaps the best-known economic education initiative in the Federal Reserve System is the Fed Challenge. This academic competition offers high-school students the opportunity to learn more about how the Federal Reserve develops monetary policy and how those policies affect the economy. Federal Reserve Bank economists provide instruction guides for developing a Fed Challenge team. These teams compete at local, regional, and national levels. The competition hones students’ analytical and presentation skills, while expanding their knowledge of economic principles. I have personally judged the national finals of this competition on two occasions and can attest to the remarkable economic knowledge displayed by these students.\\nI have included an appendix to this testimony describing some of the significant System and Federal Reserve District programs and collaborative efforts in financial and economic education.\\nPromoting Research and Identifying Best Practices\\nThe Federal Reserve also promotes, and engages in, research relevant to financial literacy. For example, understanding how families are doing financially helps financial educators decide how best to focus their efforts. The Federal Reserve Board conducts the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances to gain insight into U.S. families’ assets, borrowing, retirement saving, and use of financial institutions. Many researchers and practitioners use this unique data set in analyzing conditions and trends in consumer finances.\\nGiven the significant commitment to financial education by government, private-sector, and nonprofit organizations, it is important to determine whether such programs actually improve consumer financial literacy and behavior. Toward this end, the Federal Reserve undertakes and promotes research that aims to increase our understanding of the financial education programs and delivery channels that work best. For example, the Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs engages in research on learning preferences and consumer financial behavior. Currently, Federal Reserve researchers are collaborating with the Department of Defense to conduct a three-year longitudinal study of the effect of military-sponsored financial education on soldiers’ financial behaviors. Since 1999, the Federal Reserve System’s biennial Community Affairs Research conference has generated and highlighted new research on the efficacy of financial education. In fact, much of the research that I cited earlier has been presented at these conferences. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago maintains the Financial Education Research Center, which provides access to online resources for researchers, educators, and program developers.\\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Banks also assess the effects of financial education. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is currently evaluating the role that financial knowledge and education play in personal money management behavior. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans a year-long evaluation of its credit repair education program, which is provided to taxpayers filing for the Earned Income Tax Credit at volunteer tax preparation sites where Reserve Bank staff offer their assistance. This study seeks a better understanding of the underlying determinants of credit problems and ways in which credit counseling can improve individuals’ credit scores.\\nEmployee Financial Education\\nBesides these externally focused initiatives, the Federal Reserve seeks to improve the financial literacy of its own workforce. The Board offers a comprehensive financial education program to help employees plan their retirements and better use their benefits. We also offer regular seminars on topics ranging from budgeting and saving to buying a home or investing for children’s education. The Board maintains an internal website with links to information on quality-of-life matters, including managing finances. The website is organized by age groups and life events to help employees identify the information resources that are most relevant to their circumstances.\\nWe view our employee education program as a win-win proposition. Research has determined that such programs benefit employers as well as employees. For example, one study found that workplace financial education programs contribute to improved worker performance, increased job satisfaction, and decreased absenteeism9. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is studying how financial education programs affect employers’ bottom lines.\\nChallenges and Opportunities\\nFinancial education is a critical component of a robust and effective financial marketplace, but it is not a panacea. Clear disclosures, wise regulation, and vigorous enforcement are also essential to ensuring that financial service providers do not engage in unfair or deceptive practices. Even the most financially savvy consumer may fall victim to fraud or deception.\\nAs policymakers and educators know, providing effective financial education presents many challenges. Efforts to increase financial literacy are resource- and time-intensive. Counseling programs require trained instructors and, to be most effective, must be available to consumers near the time at which they are making an important financial decision, such as whether to buy a home. Some school programs now include financial literacy courses or modules, but curricula must be regularly updated to remain relevant and teaching methods must be adapted to the backgrounds and interests of students. In some cases, financial education efforts are constrained by gaps in math and reading literacy, which impede comprehension of fundamental financial concepts.\\nRecent findings by the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy illustrate the magnitude of the challenges still facing us, particularly in the case of young people.10 The Coalition has administered financial literacy tests to high-school students annually for the past nine years. Student performance on these tests has not improved during that time: The average score reported in the 2006 survey was 52.4 percent, up from the low of 50.2 percent in 2002 but below the 1998 score of 57.3 percent. The survey results also show a gap in financial literacy between minority and non-minority students: In the most recent survey, white students scored an average of 55 percent while African-Americans scored 44.7 percent and Hispanics scored 46.8 percent. Clearly, there is still much work to do to understand how to improve the financial literacy of young people. On the other hand, the Jump$tart survey does confirm the importance of financial literacy, in that students who score higher on the test tend to make better financial decisions. For instance, students who reported having bounced a check averaged just 45.8 percent on the financial literacy test while students with checking accounts who had never bounced a check scored higher on average, at 53.4 percent.\\nBecause financial literacy leads to better outcomes for individual consumers and for our economy generally, continued effort in this area is highly desirable. Fortunately, given the current level of interest in improving financial literacy and education both in the United States and internationally, opportunities abound for cooperation and collaboration among public, private, academic, and community institutions. Advances in technology also offer great promise for improving the quality and delivery of financial information and for sharing of research and best practices among financial education providers.\\nIn closing, I want to reaffirm the Federal Reserve System’s commitment to increased financial literacy and improved financial education. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the many partners who share these objectives.\\n\\nFinancial Education Programs and Initiatives\\n\\nIn Order of Federal Reserve Bank District \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFederal Reserve System\\n\\nAmerican Savings Education Council is a national coalition of public- and private-sector institutions committed to making saving and retirement planning a priority for all Americans. ASEC is a program of the Employee Benefit Research Institute Education and Research Fund (EBRI-ERF). ASEC brings together public- and private-sector partners to share information on best practices and to collaborate on financial-security initiatives, including the federal government\\'s Savings Matters campaign (now in its tenth year), the Choose to Save® public service campaign, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Facts on Saving and Investing campaign. The Federal Reserve Board is an ASEC mission partner, along with other government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations committed to increasing awareness of the importance of saving and financial education.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Federal Reserve is active in the America Saves initiative and serves on the National Savings Forum, its national advisory committee. The mission of this nationwide campaign--sponsored by nonprofit, corporate, and government groups--is to help individuals and families save and build wealth. The program is targeted at low- and moderate-income families, to raise their awareness and support their efforts to become more financially secure. Through local and regional campaigns, America Saves recruits \"savers,\" who commit to the program and pledge to save. As a result of their commitment, savers receive information and education about strategies for fulfilling their financial goals, such as reducing debt, building an emergency fund, and saving for a home, education, or retirement. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland played a significant leadership role in developing and launching Cleveland Saves, a pilot program for the national America Saves campaign. The program has also launched the targeted initiatives Black America Saves, Hispanic America Saves, and Military Saves.\\nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC), established by Congress in 2003 through the passage of the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act, was created to \"improve the financial literacy and education of persons in the United States through development of a national strategy to promote financial literacy and education.\" The Federal Reserve, along with numerous other federal government agencies, is a member of this commission, which is supported by the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Education.\\nU.S. Conference of Mayors’ National DOLLAR WI$E Campaign was developed to encourage the development of ongoing local strategies to educate citizens about financial issues. With improved basic money management and financial planning skills, citizens are in a better position to own homes, raise healthy families, educate their children, and invest in small businesses. The Federal Reserve Board serves as an advisor to the National DOLLAR WI$E Campaign. The Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis provide supporting programs that have been described as best practices by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\\nOperation HOPE is a nonprofit organization that provides lower-income and minority populations and communities with financial education and access to financial services. Its mission is to improve asset-building skills and accessibility of mainstream financial services for its constituencies. The organization, founded in 1992, is effective in creating public-private collaborations to fulfill its mission. Among its many national partners are the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Department of Commerce, H&R Block, E*Trade, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The Federal Reserve System has partnered with Operation HOPE in launching its youth financial education program Banking on Our Future in Washington, D.C.; Providence, Rhode Island; Atlanta, Georgia, and Los Angeles, California. A Federal Reserve Board staff member serves on Operation HOPE’s Mid-Atlantic advisory board.\\nThe Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, in its 10-year history, has brought visibility and--through its biennial survey of high school seniors--research-based data to the financial literacy movement. Jump$tart is a Washington, D.C.-based not-for-profit organization that seeks to improve the personal financial literacy of students in kindergarten through college. The coalition has grown to include more than 170 national partners and 43 affiliated state coalitions. One of its premier services is the Jump$tart Personal Finance Clearinghouse (www.jumpstartclearinghouse.org), a web site that lists more than 580 financial literacy titles and provides information about speakers and training programs. The Federal Reserve is a partner and serves on the Jump$tart Coalition board of directors.\\nThe Fed Challenge, in its twelfth year, is an academic competition in which five-member student teams play the role of monetary policy makers. In this role, each team makes a presentation in which it analyzes the current economic situation and advocates a monetary policy prescription. The team then engages in a question-and-answer session in which the judges probe to examine students’ understanding of the mechanics of monetary policy, macroeconomic concepts, and the workings of the Fed. The Fed Challenge has been a great success, as measured by participants’ grades on Advance Placement Exams, adoption of the program by other central banks (for example, the central banks of England, New Zealand, and South Korea); recommendations in the New York State Economics Syllabus, textbooks, and the National Academy Foundation’s Academy of Finance curriculum; and anecdotal evidence offered by teachers that the Fed Challenge profoundly affects participants’ career choices. The Fed Challenge is organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and many other Federal Reserve Banks participate.\\nFederalReserveEducation.org is the Federal Reserve System’s recently redesigned financial education web site, designed to increase the use of Federal Reserve educational materials and promote financial education in the classroom. The web site has material intended for the general public, as well as materials specifically geared toward teachers and high school and college students. It provides easy access to free educational materials, a resource search engine for teachers, and games for various ages and knowledge levels. FederalReserveEducation.org is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\\nFederal Reserve Community Affairs Research Conferences are sponsored to invite and highlight research on a variety of issues that affect consumer financial service policies and practices. Since 1999, this biennial event has featured research that evaluates and explores the role of financial education in improving financial outcomes for consumers, particularly those with lower incomes.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBoston\\nThe New England Economic Adventure is an hour-and-a-half interactive exhibit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that highlights New England entrepreneurs Francis Cabot Lowell, Colonel Albert Pope, and Ken Olson and investment decisions they made that enabled workers to be more productive. Increased productivity helped to raise the standard of living of the average New Englander and contributed to the overall economic growth of the region. Program use and effectiveness is tracked through visitor and teacher evaluations and an online evaluation form. Numbers of visitors, including those from low- and moderate-income communities, are also recorded.\\n\\xa0\\nPeanuts & Crackerjacks is a frequently visited online economic education program that simulates a baseball game to teach economic concepts. Pitches are questions, correct answers to questions about the economics of team sports lead to hits and runs, and wrong answers are outs. The site also includes a teacher\\'s guide. The next iteration, Economics of Entertainment, is due out in this fall. It will focus more on the abstract concept of markets and will draw from the music industry to tap into students’ own experience.\\nTalking About College is a curriculum created in collaboration with Citizen Schools, the national after-school program. It was created for middle school students to nurture their aspiration to attend college and to assist them in financial planning and the college-selection process. This curriculum has been taught as a financial literacy \"apprenticeship\" in after-school programs in the Boston Public Schools. The curriculum includes a built-in assessment.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNew York\\nIt’s All About Your Money is a program, offered in two formats, that promotes financial awareness among students in grades 4 to 8. In one format, groups of 30 to 35 students visit the Bank for roughly three hours to take part in a series of activities, including a play about bartering; an active-learning exercise about how money has changed over time; social studies lessons derived by examining foreign currency notes; and several team and individual activities focusing on budgeting, saving, and other personal finance topics. In the second format, teachers direct all of the activities described in the first format in their own classrooms by using a package of materials and guides ordered directly from the Bank through the Internet. Success is measured by the teachers, who engage students in activities and assignments before and after their visit to the Bank. Students then write letters to the Bank discussing what they learned and what they intend to do differently as a result of the program. In the 2005–2006 school year, the program was presented to 55 schools, mainly in low- and moderate-income communities, as planned.\\n\\xa0\\nFoundations of Finance: Money Management for High School and College Students is a money management workshop that teaches students basic sound practices that foster wise financial decision making. Workshop content is flexible and can be adapted to the content, format, and time specifications set forth by each host school or college. Frequently requested topics include college financing, the benefits and risks of credit use, financing life’s expected and unexpected contingencies, budgeting and building net worth, taxes and other financial obligations, wise consumer practices, work and compensation, and common financial mistakes. Success is measured by school administrators and educators, who meet to determine the extent to which the workshops helped to encourage changes in curricula and mandates. Ideally, the workshop results in the development of new courses, mandated personal finance awareness sessions for all students, or changes in course content. An attempt is made to contact all students who participated in the workshop to determine how it changed their financial practices.\\nWall Street Economics and Finance Club reaches approximately 50 high school students from throughout the Second Federal Reserve District who convene for eight two-hour monthly meetings at the New York Fed to learn more about the structure and functions of the financial system. Students take part in numerous activities, including discussions with economists, analysts, and traders at private-sector financial institutions; visits to trading floors and financial exchanges; their own presentations about financial developments and issues; and educational competitions that lead directly to internships. The Bank measures success by participating in discussions with educators involved in the program, attempting to determine the extent to which club activities resulted in changes in lesson plans, curricula, course offerings, and students’ performance and interest in finance-related topics. Students in the club become ambassadors to their classmates, encouraging greater interest in economics and finance as a course of study or career.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPhiladelphia\\nFinding the Keys to Your Financial Success is an annual, free, five-day training program for educators on a curriculum created by the Bank, the University of Delaware, the Delaware Bankers\\' Association, and the Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Maryland and Delaware.

The center has been endorsed by the Ohio Council on Economic Education.\\n\\xa0\\nFourth District Financial Education Consortia launched in June 2003 with a series of roundtable meetings with financial institutions, government agencies, and community-based nonprofits. These meetings were convened to coordinate financial education programs and discuss how to improve financial education delivery in the Fourth District, in part in response to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s financial education survey \"Financial Education: What Is It and What Makes It So Important,\" published earlier that year. The meetings were also a response to the growing complexity of financial services, predatory lending, wide gaps between white and minority homeownership rates, record low savings rates, and increases in personal bankruptcies and debt among American consumers. The roundtable meetings resulted in the formation of several financial education networks, or \"consortia,\" in the Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh regions. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has staff in each of those cities who act as coordinators for these initiatives.\\nThe Essay Contest is an annual competition for area high school students.

Good morning, everyone.  Let me just remind you that  we’re going to try to fit our slightly modified format into a one-day setting today.  We still plan to have two full rounds of discussion, the first round on the economy and the outlook, and I hope we can complete that before the coffee break.  Then we will have the second round on policy and the statement.  So to allow time for discussion, I hope that people will try to keep their remarks reasonably concise.  At the end of the meeting, we’ll have a brief report from Governor Kohn on his communications subcommittee, and we’ll talk a bit about procedures for thinking about the question of a one-day versus a two-day meeting.  So first on the agenda—Dino. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We all know that asset prices can be volatile, sometimes too volatile.  Well, the last few months have not had that quality.  Volatility in all asset classes, with the exception of commodities, continues to be low.  And yet, despite that low volatility, over the past six months investors, traders, and strategists have already been through three very different phases.  Late last year, market participants were confident that monetary policy in the United States was at or near neutrality and that once neutrality was achieved—at 4 or 4¼ percent—the Committee would stop tightening.  Then the market temporarily got worked up that monetary policy was getting too tight and that the inevitable slowdown would cause the Committee to be easing later this year.  Now we are in a new phase, in which worries about nascent inflation have supplanted the earlier fears of a slowdown and the discussion about neutrality has all but evaporated.  Markets haven’t been volatile, but sentiment has.  On page 1, the top two panels graph the three-month deposit rate for dollar, euro, and yen deposits and three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates for each.  U.S. dollar forward rates are trading on top of each other, anticipating either the end of the tightening cycle or a lengthy pause starting sometime soon.  The minutes of the Committee’s March meeting made public in mid-April and the Chairman’s JEC testimony were both taken as signals that a pause was on the horizon, despite the qualified language in both and despite other data that were generally strong and that contributed to the rise in long-term yields, which I’ll talk about later.  In the euro area, forward rates continued their steady upward climb as growth forecasts increased, business confidence improved, and the European Central Bank signaled that more tightening was likely.  Markets anticipate roughly 25 basis points of tightening per quarter through year-end.  The list of central banks that have tightened recently includes Canada, 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). the minimum lending rate that financial institutions can charge 27 basis points, to 5.85 percent, though I’m not sure that qualifies as a tightening for an economy with real growth in double digits.  The Bank of Japan is working to slowly bring down the current account balances.  From about ¥30 trillion, balances have now been reduced to about half that level.  The BOJ will continue to bring them down over the next month and then will likely maintain a buffer above required reserves for a period to give banks more time to adjust to the interest rate targeting framework that will follow.  As the middle panel shows, yen forward rates have continued to rise, and markets now presume that the BOJ will bring the overnight call rate to 25 basis points sometime this autumn—but rumors circulated overnight that the first increase could come as early as July.  Those rumors fueled a rise of 9 basis points in two-year Japanese government bond yields and Euroyen futures.  The bottom panel graphs the two- and ten-year Treasury yields and the target fed funds rate.  Since the last meeting, the ten-year yield has risen 34 basis points, and the curve has steepened.  This is consistent with the ebbing of worries about a policy-induced slowdown.  The curve steepening was given a push by news, particularly the release of the minutes, of a possible pause in the cycle.  year yield.  Real yields have risen about 40 basis points since early March and 14 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.  The top right panel graphs the ten-year breakeven rate (the blue line) and five-year breakeven rate five years forward (the green line).  Both have risen since early April with the five-year forward rate rising somewhat more.  On a technical note, these are straight breakeven rates without adjustments for carry.  The picture of rising real and rising breakeven rates is also visible internationally—at least for those countries with inflation-linked bonds.  The middle left panel graphs the change in the real yield this year for France, the United Kingdom, and Japan.  Real yields have risen in all three by varying degrees.  The middle right panel graphs the change in their breakeven rates.  All three have moved about 20 basis points so far this year—somewhat less than the 36 basis point increase for the United States.  Fueling the sentiment about inflation expectations has been the rise in commodity prices.  The bottom left panel graphs selected metal prices indexed from January 1.  Some of these are at record highs or, in the case of gold, multidecade highs.  The right panel graphs the movement of energy prices so far this year.  The one outlier is natural gas, which rose sharply after Katrina but fell back when consumption did not meet forecasts because of an unseasonably warm winter.   Let us turn to page 3 and the other element that has garnered substantial attention:  the recent weakness of the dollar.  After being stuck in a narrow $1.18 to $1.22 range, the euro appreciated out of that range in mid-April as sentiment turned against the dollar, as shown in the top left panel.  This morning it was trading just below $1.28.  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated from ¥118 to the dollar in early April to about ¥110.60 this morning.  It’s rate.  Call me skeptical, but I find it hard to believe that markets awoke to the scale of the imbalances only when reading the now-famous annex in the G7 communiqué.  And yet that there was a shift in sentiment can be felt if not visibly observed.  One place this shift in sentiment can be felt is in options markets.  The middle left panel graphs one-month risk reversals, where dollar puts are bid relative to dollar calls, especially against the yen, and suggests that market participants are more concerned about further downside for the dollar.  Another view into this phenomenon is through interest rate differentials.  The middle right panel graphs the euro–dollar exchange rate and the differential between December 2006 Eurodollar and Euribor futures.  The two tracked pretty closely in 2005 and most of this year but started to diverge in mid-April, suggesting that the effect of interest rate differentials on the exchange rate had lessened and, hence, that something else was exerting greater force.    So what are some possible explanations for the shift in sentiment?  At the macro level, most forecasts have the United States slowing down in the second half while Japan and Europe do not slow, even if in level terms the United States is still growing faster.  Second, the strong growth of the global economy is being interpreted by some in the leveraged community as increasing the odds that emerging Asian countries in particular will allow a rise in their currencies—and hence less dollar accumulation—in the period ahead.  Some countries are apparently struggling with sterilization of accumulated reserves.  A third explanation is the continued nagging fear that central banks will diversify their dollar holdings.  During much of April there were rumors that a large central bank—presumed to be from the Middle East—was selling dollars.  Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know.  However, it is true that a central bank from Europe—the Swedish Riksbank—was in the midst of lowering its dollar holdings, eliminating its yen holdings, and increasing holdings of European and other currencies.  The Swedes made their changes public on April 21.  Whether other central banks will follow is an open question; but analysts have noted the prisoner’s dilemma that the large holders of dollars face on this question of diversification, and it is one the markets focus on intensely and are acutely sensitive to.  Finally, the markets noted the Treasury’s report on foreign holdings of U.S. securities for the year through June 2005 and the unfavorable revisions it contained.  This report corrects the estimations in the monthly TIC data.  Whereas the TIC data reported that private investors were the large buyers in that twelve-month span, it now turns out that private demand was minimal and that most of the buying was by official accounts.    The bottom panel charts the appreciation against the dollar by a range of currencies in the intermeeting period.  Several of these are commodity based, but many are not.  And even some of the currencies I talked about last time that had been caught in the liquidation of carry trades made strong comebacks.  Yes, even the Icelandic krona, which fell another 10 percent after your last meeting, has reversed course and, on balance, has risen slightly since March 28.  I should note that the Canadian dollar is at its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since 1977.  Besides the positive terms-of-trade shock, the Canadians have both strong growth and low inflation and something we don’t have:  a current account surplus and an ongoing budget surplus that is being used to pay down debt.  operating balances since 2001 and the target fed funds rate.  Required operating balances (ROBs) have fallen sharply as the opportunity cost of holding demand deposits has risen.  From a peak of about $23 billion, required balances have fallen to about $15 billion.  Significant changes in the level of ROBs have been associated with changes in fed funds rate volatility because lower levels of such balances give banks less scope for absorbing daily shocks to their reserve holdings at the Fed.  Meanwhile, a lower level of ROBs provides the Desk with less scope to manage the funds rate by adjusting the daily reserves supplied without forcing banks either to borrow at the discount window or to accumulate unwanted excess reserves.  So far the effect of the decline in required operating balances has been muted, and we do have some experience in operating in such an environment from the last time that required balances were at such levels in the late 1990s and the early part of this  Finally, I want to inform the Committee that the Desk has just finished implementing a new electronic trading system that we call FedTrade and through which we conduct open that was inflexible and no longer suited our needs.  The bottom panel lists some of FedTrade’s main features.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations.  I will need approval of domestic operations. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  On the rise in inflation breakevens since our last  meeting, do you have a sense about the breakdown between carry effects, expectations, and risk premiums? MR. KOS.  Well, as somebody said in another setting just the other day, risk premiums are something we don’t know a lot about, and they are difficult to disentangle.  I haven’t done the exercise, but with energy prices rising, I don’t know that the carry effects have been huge. MR. REINHART.  The carry effects are going to matter only for the first part of it.  And as we noted in the Bluebook, at the time we had an increase in inflation compensation of about 15 basis points.  Most of it was related to energy prices.  If you think about the term structure of energy futures, they actually tilt down at the far end, and so that would go the wrong way.  So everything in terms of the rise in the five-year-ahead five-year forward rate would be inflation compensation.  If you go to our half then would be inflation expectations. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  My other question relates to a regulatory relief bill in the Congress, which is very likely to pass, that would allow us to pay interest on reserves and to have more flexibility in setting required reserves.  Would you like to comment on the potential operational implications of that? MR. KOS.  We would welcome that.  It would make our life a bit easier. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you see any operational issues in just getting to the point where we can manage that? MR. KOS.  I don’t think so.  Spence? MR. HILTON.  No, I think that adapting to that environment would not be a problem for us.  It would probably be very easy to do. MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, I would note that the first place I could find mention of the Federal Reserve’s asking about paying interest on reserves was in 1965.  But there are some operational implications, including in the STAR (Statistics and Reserves) process, of actually figuring out a way of paying interest on reserves.  It came close about four years ago, I guess, and we had put modifications into STAR in order to be able to pay interest on reserves.  There might be some bumps along the way. MR. KOS.  But those are transitional, operational hurdles. MR. KOHN.  In fact, the point of asking for this authority was to make sure that the Desk didn’t run into issues in the future of the sort that Dino was outlining.  We can put the interest on balances at the Federal Reserve at such a level that banks can arbitrage these balances and we won’t have trouble hitting our target.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I understand it’s a good thing for us.   demand for reserves, we can simplify reserve requirements, which are quite antiquated and kind of embarrassing. MR. KOHN.  Including simplifying them at zero.  [Laughter] MR. REINHART.  Yes. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  What’s the probability that this is going to pass? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It appears to be very high. MR. KOHN.  It’s in both the House and the Senate bills, but the House bill is a very different bill.  It has controversial things in it. MS. MINEHAN.  Haven’t we been there before? MR. KOHN.  No.  We haven’t gotten quite this far before. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  They eliminated a number of controversial items so that this could go through.  Other questions?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  My sense is that the broad conventional way of thinking about how we would implement interest on reserves is to pay a rate of interest somewhat below the federal funds target rate.  My sense is that the conventional view emerged at a time when we were less transparent about our targeting of the funds rate.  The Chairman asked you whether it would be an operational problem for you.  The natural thing, if you’re pegging the funds rate, is to use the rate of interest on deposits to do it, so you don’t have to estimate where the demand curve for funds lies every day.  Have you folks thought about whether paying interest on reserves at the target rate would be a feasible mechanism? MR. KOS.  I can speak only for myself.  I have worked on the presumption that we would set it, as you started out, below the funds rate, so we would in effect be creating something of a corridor with the primary credit rate on top and a deposit facility at the bottom.  Now, whether that would be 1 percent I viewed it rather than paying it at the target. MR. HILTON.  We have thought of different ways that the ability to pay interest on reserves could be used, and you’re making a distinction between a rate that might be paid on excess and a rate that might be paid on required.  Maybe they’d be the same; maybe they would be different.  Depending on which you chose, you could have a very different framework for implementing policy on a day-to-day basis.  Operationally, from the Desk’s perspective, they could both be executed in a fairly straightforward fashion. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  May I just ask about the breakeven rate in TIPS—we looked at it and saw perhaps some seasonality to it.  Is that just nonsense, or have you looked at it or thought about it? MR. KOS.  I’ve spoken about that in the past actually.  There has been some seasonality.  It has happened before—that some seasonal moves upward have occurred in the first part of the year. MR. HOENIG.  Usually this part of the year. MR. KOS.  Yes, usually in this part of the year.  That relationship has not been stable, but one has noticed that there has been that tendency. MR. HOENIG.  But you haven’t actually systematically looked at it? MR. KOS.  We looked at it a couple of years ago, and we noted it, but I think it was just too unstable. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Having nothing to do with the subject we’re currently discussing, but going back to your chart of metals prices, is there a way to get a judgment from the staff as to how much of this is exchanges?  We probably already have that, Vince, but it would be helpful.  We keep discussing this with regard to oil prices, for example.  In terms of the big integrated companies, nobody knows the answer, that I can determine, but clearly a good deal of this is speculative activity as opposed to real demand.  The question is, Could somebody send around a memo that gives us a breakdown, if possible? MR. KOS.  We could look into it.  MR. FISHER.  Including the volume expansions? MR. KOS.  Yes.  The volume expansions are something we can probably get data on.  I’m not sure that doing so will answer the question that you would like answered, which is how much of the price movement is linked to certain classes of participants. MR. FISHER.  For example, Exxon will tell you that, in terms of futures trading just on oil, West Texas crude was 6 billion in 1999; this year it’s running at a 120 billion rate.  That tells you something—we just don’t know what.  But it would be helpful for us to get a breakdown.  At least it would be helpful to me. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Hearing no other questions, we need a vote to ratify domestic operations.  Do we have a motion? VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any objection?  Thank you.  Yes?  Dino. MR. KOS.  Very briefly, I circulated a memo that comes around at this time every year asking you to vote to approve renewal of the swap lines to Canada and Mexico. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do I have a motion? VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Discussion?  President Lacker. central bank’s being involved in foreign exchange operations, much less lending to foreign central banks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other comments?  I’ll ask for a show of hands.  All in favor?  Opposed?  Thank you.   We have an issue related to FOIA.  A memorandum was distributed proposing to delegate certain FOIA responsibilities as described in the May 1 note to the Committee from Scott Alvarez and Kit Wheatley.  Scott is here, I assume?  Yes, there he is.  Are there any questions for Scott?  These are just technical changes.  Do I have a motion? MS. BIES.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So moved.  Thank you.  Any objection?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Our next item on the agenda is the economic situation. MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am told that counselors are taught to begin by acknowledging the validity of the fears and anxieties of those whom they are counseling.  The strategy then is to deconstruct and examine in greater detail the specific sources of heightened anxiety in order to gain better perspective on the problems at hand.  Being a naturally anxious person, I have had moments in the past six weeks when I felt the need to engage in a little “self help” therapy by employing this strategy on myself.  So this morning, I thought that I would report the results of my efforts to identify and analyze some of the developments over the intermeeting period that could have made one more uneasy about the outlook for activity and inflation.  I’ll admit that there have been a few reasons to be concerned.  The growth in real GDP in the first quarter was very strong—even stronger than we had expected in the March Greenbook.  And most components of spending surprised us to the upside.  Moreover, hard evidence of the anticipated second-quarter slowdown is still sparse.  Meanwhile, inflation concerns have been mounting.  Oil prices are up another $10 per barrel, and the prices of non-oil commodities are soaring amid signs that the global economy is strengthening.  The dollar seems to be sinking on good news and bad.  The incoming data on core consumer prices have exceeded our expectations a bit.  And measures of expected inflation have moved higher.  Clearly, there is plenty to keep one up at night.    into a familiar trap of overshooting on policy.  If policy were to lean against strength in activity and inflation pressure that was largely seen in the rear-view mirror, the risk of tightening too much and for too long would be amplified.  In that regard, the evidence has continued to accumulate that housing markets are softening, and last Friday’s employment report at least hinted at some slowing in labor demand.  Tightening significantly further when the economy already may have begun to decelerate risks an unwelcome cyclical downturn in the economy.  Given our poor track record in predicting recessions, one should not take lightly the risk of overshooting the mark.    I’m not embarrassed to admit that I’ve harbored both fears—that of falling behind the curve and that of overshooting—often on the same day and sometimes even in the same conversation with my colleagues.  [Laughter]  But in the end, I have come to the view that, while you are almost certainly somewhat behind or somewhat ahead of the curve, there are some good reasons to think that you are not too far from the curve.    So just how strong is the economy at present, and will it maintain that strength going forward?  As you know, we had been expecting a big bump-up in the growth of output in the first quarter, in part as activity rebounded from hurricane-depressed levels.  And we surely got it.  We are now estimating that the growth of real GDP in the first quarter was 5¼ percent, about ½ percentage point faster than projected in the March Greenbook.  That said, it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which that surprise signals greater underlying momentum in the economy.  About half of our miss in the first quarter reflected higher-than-expected federal spending.  While I’ll admit that “higher-than-expected federal spending” might seem to be an oxymoron, we view the first-quarter miss as largely one of timing, related in part to FEMA outlays.  We are expecting the level of federal spending to drop back in the current quarter.  Inventory investment outside the motor vehicle sector, after being very subdued in the second half of last year, also has surprised us to the upside of late.  Although it is presently providing a lift to activity, we would not expect inventory investment to be a source of ongoing impetus to production.   Of course, these were not our only surprises.  Household and business spending, too, have come in above our expectations, and we read domestic demand as having somewhat greater momentum than we had earlier thought.  As a consequence, we revised up our projection for second-quarter growth in real GDP to 3¾ percent—similar to the above-trend pace that we experienced over the past year.  Had everything else remained as it was in for the remainder of the year as well.  But there have been some powerful countervailing forces with which we have had to contend.   The steep rise in the price of crude oil has continued to siphon purchasing power from the household sector.  The bill for imported oil is now expected to be about $50 billion per year higher than in our March projection.  Moreover, gasoline prices have increased even more than oil prices, reflecting a tight inventory situation that has resulted from some refinery gasoline.  Because the spending propensities of oil company shareholders are likely lower than those of gasoline consumers, the transfer of income between these two groups also is likely to subtract some from consumer spending.  In the very near term, we have households dipping into saving to meet their higher energy bills, but we think that some adjustment to overall spending plans probably is under way and that more will be required in coming quarters.  Besides the restraining effects of higher oil prices, the recent increase in long-term interest rates is expected to weigh on activity over the remainder of the projection period.  To be sure, some of that increase reflects higher expected inflation.  But real long-term rates have increased as well, in part as term premiums have widened a bit.  Mortgage rates and corporate bond rates are expected to run about 20 to 30 basis points above the levels that in our previous projection we had assumed would prevail.  Obviously, those increases have been too recent to have yet affected demand; but we expect that, by the second half of the year, higher rates will be leaving an imprint on housing activity and business investment.  As you know from reading the Greenbook, the stronger underlying momentum in the economy is eventually more than offset by the greater drag from higher energy prices and interest rates, leaving the level of output a touch weaker by the end of 2007 than forecast in March.   What about inflation concerns?  There can be little doubt that price pressures have intensified somewhat over the intermeeting period.  As I noted earlier, crude oil prices have risen about $10 per barrel, and participants in futures markets expect those higher prices to persist.  Other commodity prices have been soaring as well, especially prices for industrial metals.  These increases can be expected to add a bit to core inflation in coming months.  Another troubling development in the inflation picture has been the increase in most measures of inflation compensation and inflation expectations.  TIPS measures of inflation compensation have increased between 15 and 20 basis points over the intermeeting period.  At the same time, the Michigan survey measure of median year-ahead inflation expectations increased to 3.3 percent, and the median measure of inflation expectations five to ten years ahead edged up to 3.1 percent; both are about ¼ percentage point higher than in March.  Still, these developments should be placed in perspective.  None of these measures has breached the range that has been maintained over the past few years.  And there have been several episodes during that period when expectations moved up as much as or more than they have in the past six weeks, only to reverse course on softer news about the economy or inflation.  So for now, it is difficult to gauge the extent to which there has been any meaningful deterioration in inflation expectations.  Moreover, we have scant evidence that higher price inflation or higher inflation expectations have become embedded in labor costs.  As you know, the employment cost index (ECI) rose at an annual rate of just 2½ percent in the first three months of the year, more than 1½ percentage points less than we had projected.  In contrast, we currently estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at a 5¾ percent annual rate in the first quarter, about 1½ percentage points more than we had projected.  Nonetheless, despite their divergent movements last quarter, both measures actually decelerated over the past year.  To be sure, because labor compensation tends to lag prices in the overall inflation process, this observation should provide only difficult to argue that you have fallen far behind the curve.   We continue to expect the growth of hourly labor compensation to pick up going forward in response to tight labor markets, the increases in labor productivity that have occurred in recent years, and the lagged effects of higher price inflation.  Nevertheless, with price expected to result chiefly in some narrowing of profit margins rather than in an increase in price inflation.  What about the price data themselves?  Both the core consumer price index (CPI) and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices rose 0.3 percent in March, exceeding our expectations.  Some of the surprise in both measures was attributable to higher-than-expected increases in apparel prices that may have more to do with imperfectly anticipated seasonal patterns than underlying trends and to a step-up in medical prices related to increased Medicare reimbursements.  As a consequence, we attach only a small signal to this upside surprise.  All told, the developments over the past six weeksCanother jump in oil prices, some deterioration of inflation expectations, and a slightly higher reading on core inflationCled us to mark up our projection of core consumer price inflation, but just by 0.1 percent in both 2006 and 2007.  The pattern of projected inflation remains the same.  As higher prices for oil and other commodities are passed through into the prices of final goods and services, core PCE inflation is projected to move up to a 2¼ percent pace this year.  With those prices expected to flatten out next year and with the pass-through of the earlier run-ups largely complete, we expect core PCE inflation to ease back down to a 2 percent pace in 2007.   Finally, what about the concern that we could be in the process of overshooting the mark on policy tightening?  Because policy operates with a lag and because we are so poor at predicting turning points, this risk seems especially relevant after a period of substantial tightening.  But given the strength that appears evident in both domestic and foreign economies, my guess is that the expansion is not so fragile that some modest overshoot on policy would result in a cyclical downturn in activity.  Moreover, if our baseline assessment of the economy is close to the mark, a higher path for the funds rate might not even be deemed an overshooting.  As we noted in a simulation in the Bluebook, greater policy tightening than is built into the baseline might be desired if your objective is to achieve a more rapid and pronounced decline in core price inflation.  So, in the end, while we could see a heap of worries in a variety of different directions, we interpreted recent developments as warranting only small changes in our forecast.  That forecast remains one in which activity slows to a more sustainable pace and inflation fluctuates around recent levels.  Still, I don’t want to be seen as offering false reassurances.  Much could happen to change the outlook.  My own concerns about potential outcomes that could take us far from the staff baseline projection are centered mainly on asset markets.  Asset markets are impressive information-processing machines that, for the most part, deliver very efficient outcomes.  But those markets are also subject, from time to time, to abrupt for policymakers to influence.   I see risks on both sides of the ledger here.  One of the risks associated with overshooting is that, at some point, higher interest rates could trigger a sharp contraction in house prices and real estate activity.  Given the long lags with which we receive reliable information on house prices, such developments might take some time to recognize and thus might prove harder to counteract than implied by our alternative scenarios.  Of course, undershooting on policy also presents risks for asset markets.  If policy were to trigger a substantial fall in the dollar, inflation pressures and your efforts to deal with those pressures could create some significant challenges for monetary policy and for the economy.  Karen will have more to say on the prospects for the dollar in her presentation.   MS. JOHNSON.  On the international side, two major developments during the intermeeting period merit some further discussion this morning:  the rapid and sizable run-up in global prices for crude oil and the significant depreciation of the exchange value of the dollar in the second half of the period.  Those developments occurred against a background of continued strong global growth, with some economic indicators again surprising us on the positive side for some countries.  As a result, we are still expecting moderately strong foreign real GDP growth at an annual rate of 3½ percent over the forecast period, with inflation projected to remain contained although upside risks are a concern.   When we finalized the March Greenbook forecast, the spot price of WTI was just over $60 per barrel.  Last week, as we completed the forecast for this meeting, that price reached about $75 per barrel before partially retracing.  The intervening seven weeks had witnessed almost daily tales of woe of higher prices, with the supply problems in Nigeria proving more persistent and serious than earlier thought and tensions over the nuclear program of Iran adding to heightened pressures on energy prices.  In addition, outages of U.S. crude production as a result of the hurricanes continue, as do issues regarding supply from Iraq and Venezuela.  Events in Bolivia have also rattled the energy market.  As a result, and consistent with the shift in futures prices for the rest of this year and next, we raised the projected path of the U.S. oil import price about $10 per barrel.  As in March, that path rises slightly through the end of this year and then is about flat in 2007.   One significant and direct consequence of the higher oil prices is an increase in the U.S. oil import bill from that forecast in March.  In the baseline forecast, the value of oil imports has been revised up $34 billion for this year and $48 billion for next.  As a consequence, of the approximately $150 billion widening of the U.S. nominal trade balance that we now project from the fourth quarter of last year to the final quarter of 2007, just about one-third is accounted for by the enlarged oil bill.  The overall trade deficit is now expected to be about 6½ percent of GDP at the end of next year.   A second consequence of higher global oil prices is that the revenues to the world’s oil exporters have significantly increased.  This positive change to the external revenue of these countries has raised a number of questions about their propensities to import and from whom and their decisions about how to hold the funds that they have received and have not as yet exporting countries are sparse; in many cases, the funds are held by national oil companies or in special stabilization funds, neither of which are likely to be included in reports of foreign official reserves.  Moreover, officials in some of these countries tend not to reveal detailed information about their holdings.  A case can be made that increased revenue flows to these countries over recent years likely added to overall global net saving and contributed to low long-term interest rates globally.  It is still uncertain whether their behavior has had or will in the future have a systematic influence on exchange rates.    From U.S. TIC data, we have some limited information about some categories of dollar holdings that are current through March of this year.  As was reported in Part 2 of the Greenbook, inflows of foreign official assets in the United States held by OPEC countries were quite strong in the fourth quarter of last year and in January.  However, in February and countries.  For total portfolio inflows to the United States that combine public and private investors, funds from oil exporters (including the Middle East, Mexico, Russia, and Norway) were more than $25 billion in the first quarter—a pace comparable with that in 2005.  The $25 billion inflow compares with estimates of the net oil revenues of the oil exporters of about $200 billion in the first quarter.  Again, the monthly data show a sizable step-down in the size of inflows after January.  Among the oil exporters, there is some variation across countries in their inflows into the United States.  After showing positive inflows in the previous two years, net outflows were recorded for both Russia and Venezuela in the first quarter.  In contrast, inflows from Middle East oil exporters, Mexico, and Norway were strong.  All told, although total inflows for oil exporters remained near rates in 2005, there are some hints of possible diversification away from assets held in the United States by some oil-exporting countries, especially in more recent months.  I should note that these countries by the TIC data and may give rise to entries for countries such as the United Kingdom that are the location of major global financial intermediaries.   We have only extremely partial data for U.S. financial inflows in April, so it is not possible to relate the recent sharp depreciation of the dollar to any pattern in such data.  The exchange value of the dollar fell significantly against all the currencies of our index of major industrial country trading partners as well as against the currencies of Brazil, Korea, Chile, and most other Asian emerging-market economies.  This broad-based decline reflects a significant change in preferences on the margin among at least some global investors and intermeeting period, U.S. long-term nominal interest rates moved up nearly 40 basis points.  But rates rose 20 or more basis points in most foreign industrial countries.  Real long-term interest rates taken from inflation-indexed, sovereign securities in Japan and the euro area also rose about 20 basis points, comparable to the change in U.S. inflation-indexed rates.  A significant decrease in the market value of the dollar with no evident change in relative real rates of return on comparable fixed-income securities could indicate an increase in the risk premium attached to holding dollars, or it could signal a change in perceptions of the long-run real exchange value of the dollar.    does show through in our forecast.  For real exports of core goods, the drop in the level of the dollar to date and the slightly faster pace we now project for real dollar depreciation imply that relative prices will boost growth of these exports about 1 percentage point more over the remainder of the forecast period than we thought in March, based on our model.  For real exports of services, the story is similar.  For core import prices, our equations imply a positive effect, concentrated in this year.  However, when incoming data and other factors are taken into account, our projection for import price inflation is only a little above that in the previous Greenbook, and so the net effect on real imports is negligible.  For real imports of services, a negative effect from higher relative prices is evident in the baseline projection.    For the nominal measures at the end of the forecast period, total exports are revised up, but total imports are up more.  The enlarged oil bill accounts for virtually all of the upward revision to nominal total imports.  As a consequence, the trade deficit has been revised to a somewhat larger figure.  That change is significantly offset by the effects of the lower dollar on projected investment income.  The lower dollar is positive for investment income as it translates earnings abroad of U.S. firms into more dollars.  In addition, in our forecast those earnings are directly boosted by higher oil prices.  All told, our outlook for the current account deficit is for more-rapid deterioration this year than we previously thought but a deficit at the end of 2007 that is only slightly larger than we had been expecting in March.  David and I would be happy to answer any questions.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Questions for our colleagues?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  David, I noted an alternative scenario in the Greenbook in which inflation expectations are unanchored, and the description of the scenario says that inflation expectations end up ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  I looked around for the baseline time series for inflation expectations, but I couldn’t find it.  What are they? MR. STOCKTON.  Well, that’s a good question.  The reason we don’t publish an inflation expectations series is that we’re using a lot of different measures of inflation expectations to gauge where underlying inflation is.  We’re using a lot of different models for that matter, too.  Some are purely backward-looking models, in which inflation expectations and underlying inflation are basically proxied by lagged inflation.  In other models, there are explicit measures.  For example, in FRB/US we use the Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters as a long-run anchor on inflation expectations, and then we allow that to move over time as people are assumed to learn about the Fed’s add-factor up ½ percentage point from what it was. Now, I think the deeper question you’re asking is, what do we think underlying inflation is currently in the economy, and what lies under the staff’s inflation projection?  We think there has probably already been, roughly speaking, something like ½ percentage point deterioration in underlying inflation from where it was in 2003, when actual inflation was running just a little above 1 percent.  We thought that was unusually low, and our estimate of underlying inflation was about 1½ percent. What fits into this forecast now is that there probably has been some upward creep roughly on the order of ½ percentage point to something like 2 percent.  The scenario that we were showing you in this Greenbook had some further deterioration over and above that.  Until recently, there wasn’t a lot, other than the pickup in actual core inflation itself, that we could point to for a deterioration in inflation expectations.  I think we’re still nervous about making that call in this forecast.  It could very well be that inflation expectations have remained well anchored, and we have been showing some scenarios in the Greenbook that take that possibility into account.  As I noted in my briefing, although one could use what’s happened to inflation expectations and inflation compensation over the intermeeting period as being supportive or consistent with what underlies the forecast, we still think it’s too early to make the call that a determination has definitively occurred.  So, our basic view is that there has probably been some pickup.  It’s been limited.  But obviously, there are risks on both sides of that.  One side is that inflation expectations could have stayed better anchored.  On the other, there may be the risk that inflation expectations are at the front edge of a process of increasing and that they will continue to deteriorate. MR. LACKER.  I appreciate your answer.  Let me tell you what motivated my question. First was the broad concern about inflation.  But, second, in looking at the Greenbook and thinking through us.  I note that you tell us quantitatively about other sorts of latent variables—for example, the NAIRU and potential output.  I thought perhaps inflation expectations deserved the same explicit quantitative treatment in the Greenbook. MR. STOCKTON.  If I could respond to that for just a second—I’d be happy to write a number down on the back of an envelope. [Laughter]  If we were to write a number down, I’d caution you not to take it too seriously.  I think you ought to be looking at survey measures of inflation expectations.  You ought to be looking at market-based measures of inflation expectations.  And in some sense, I think you still need to take seriously models that have adaptive expectations as well, because they could be reflecting how people are learning or how they might be influenced by past inflation.  We show some of those things.  We could show a lagged inflation term, or as I say, we could certainly create a variable that we would call inflation expectations for purposes of the staff forecast.  But I’d be nervous about giving it prominence over and above these other measures that I think you should be taking on board as well. MR. LACKER.  I can appreciate that, but it comes up in our deliberations.  Last fall, we were talking about the reaction to Katrina, and you were showing us a scenario in which core inflation rose and then fell in the first half of this year.  I asked you what happened to inflation expectations along that path, and they rose and then smoothly fell.  For us to get a handle on whether that’s a reasonable scenario, it helps to think through what would bring about a fall in inflation expectations like that and whether they can vary at high frequency as they seem to have over the last month or two.  But I don’t want you guys penciling down numbers just to pencil down numbers.  I appreciate the difficulties involved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. First of all, I do want to commend the Board staff and the staff of the Reserve Banks on the special survey.  I thought the information on nonresidential construction was very useful. Here are my questions.  First, is there a way we can reconcile the ECI and the compensation data?  They seem to be further apart than typical.  I don’t know technically whether doing so is possible or the extent to which it’s possible.  Second, you note in the Greenbook, but without any real explanation, that federal tax revenues are coming in extraordinarily strong—stronger than anticipated.  What do we know about why that might be the case?  I would also ask about your expected narrowing of profit margins.  My question is, why?  There are lots and lots of economic incentives for corporate managers to keep those margins high and to expand them if they can.  A lot of people have compensation linked to profits, the stock market, and so forth.  So it seems to me that the economics would say that there’s no reason particularly to expect a reversion.  I gather that your explanation was that it’s sort of outside what we have typically observed and, in a time series sense, you expect it to go back.  But I’m worried about the economics underlying that view.  I think it’s quite important for the inflation outlook because, even if wages are well contained, it could well be that companies will just take price increases whenever they can and enjoy the benefits of the profits.  So I’ll let you deal with those in any way you want. [Laughter] MR. STOCKTON.  About the issue of reconciling the ECI with the compensation per hour figures, the previous Chairman tortured us [laughter]—and the Bureau of Labor Statistics—for a number of years precisely on this issue on the thought that we ought to be able somehow to resolve the difference in these measures.  That came to no avail.  [Laughter] The BLS for a while was publishing a measure for wages of nonsupervisory workers just to see whether or not it was tracking, and it actually roughly tracked what was happening in the average hourly the series, there are some very significant gaps in the past, and the one that we’re currently witnessing actually doesn’t even necessarily stand out relative to the historical changes.  One of the major factors in explaining some of those past deviations was that the exercise of stock options is included in nonfarm business compensation but not in the ECI.  We just don’t know at this point whether that could be explaining last quarter.  I think I’d make the bigger point that, over the past year, both those measures have actually slowed somewhat so that, in terms of their second difference, they are not telling substantially different stories.  It’s a significant frustration for us, as I’m assuming it is for you, that we’re unable to have a better answer to reconcile them. As for taxes being stronger—they have been significantly stronger.  Obviously, at this point, we don’t really know the reasons that they have been stronger than they were projected.  It could be a shift in income distribution toward higher-income individuals.  It could be signaling greater strength in underlying income than is currently being measured.  In the past, we have not had any success in using those revenue surprises to predict ultimate revisions in aggregate income.  While I think it’s a plausible hypothesis, it doesn’t have a lot of empirical support. MR. WILCOX.  For us, anyway, most of the surprise has been on the nonwithheld side, on the final payments, and that implicates maybe something like capital gains rather than the sort of more directly payroll-tied sources of income. MR. STOCKTON.  And small upward surprises on the withheld portion.  As David notes, most of it is in the nonwithheld portion. On the economics behind the forecast for the profit margins to revert just a bit toward mean, there is empirical and historical support for that kind of movement, and I think there are some good economic reasons for it as well.  Obviously, income shares in the United States have been remarkably widened as much as they have in the past few years, for them to narrow.  The mechanism through which that occurs is that there is both pressure coming through tighter labor markets to push up overall wages and competitive pressure in product markets to compete down those profit margins over time through lower prices. So you’re absolutely right.  Obviously, no business will willingly give up profits.  But we have a good reason to think that, faced with significant competitive pressures, profit margins ought, over time, to revert back to historical norms.  We haven’t been terribly aggressive in pushing this particular feature of the forecast, meaning that we don’t have them coming down a whole lot.  We basically have them leveling off and just inching down further on.  But we think there are some good economic reasons why that happened in the past and why it could happen going forward.  If we are experiencing right now some permanent shift in income distribution away from labor toward capital, then using history as a guide here could throw you off.  But I guess that I wouldn’t start with that presumption. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, wanted to ask about the alternative simulation that President Lacker talked about, the greater pass-through with unanchored expectations.  It seems to give the impression that inflation is pretty controllable, and I have a bit more concern than that.  You said in the scenario at the end that, beyond 2007, policy would yield a noticeable rise in the real federal funds rate.  I guess that the action is all after ’07 the way you have phased in this gradual increase in inflation expectations of 50 basis points.  So I guess I’ll start with the question, how does it play out in ’08 and ’09?  What would be the cost in terms of output and price stability?  Then, of course, expectations could rise more quickly.  The increase wouldn’t necessarily have to be gradual over this implications be for beyond 2006 and 2007?  MR. STOCKTON.  Starting with that last point, an increase in inflation expectations leads almost one for one into actual inflation, and in relatively short order.  If some significant shift occurred in inflation expectations, you could expect that it would show up as higher inflation immediately.  Now, in the model, inflation is a very inertial variable, and that has two implications.  One is that it takes time for inflation to get out of your control, but it also means that it’s extremely costly to bring back down again.  So if one looked beyond the 2007 horizon, if you wanted inflation at 2 or 1½, you’d have a lot of work left to be done in terms of generating a cumulative output gap.  You have the sacrifice ratio; we think it is something like 4.  That would mean that, if you were at 2½ and wanted to go to 1½, you’d have to have four point-years of unemployment above the NAIRU to get inflation back down to that 1½ level.  So the news is both good and bad regarding the slow response of inflation.  It’s slow to move up, but then it’s also costly to bring back down again. MR. REINHART.  You see exactly that point, President Moskow, in the alternative simulation in the Bluebook in which we asked what it would take over the extended Greenbook period to achieve an inflation target of 1½ percent—which effectively means to work out ½ percentage point worth of inflation.  You have to keep the real five-year interest rate almost ¾ percentage point higher until the end of the decade to do that.  You also see the importance, as President Lacker noted, of the behavior of inflation expectations because in one simulation we assume that inflation expectations evolve as they have historically—that is, only gradually adjusting.  In the other simulation we ask, what happens if that adjustment is quicker?  The answer is that monetary policy is a lot easier when inflation expectations are better anchored at a lower level. together with the ones in the Greenbook.  I found them together to be very helpful.  It’s this inertia that concerns me.  Earlier in my career I was involved in fighting inflation, and once it gets out of control it is very, very difficult to bring back under control. MR. REINHART.  Again, as the property of the model that Dave mentioned, it’s a very flat Phillips curve.  It takes a lot of unemployment years to work that back. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker has a two-handed intervention. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Just very briefly, I wanted to get a bit more of the benefit of your expertise about how inflation expectations evolve.  As you noted, they evolved slowly in the historical data.  But there are episodes, like the last couple of weeks, when I get the sense that they can move fairly rapidly. MR. REINHART.  I’m not sure I have that expertise.  Perhaps the evolution of inflation expectations is asymmetric, as President Moskow suggested.  Perhaps it’s also what we look at at a high frequency.  Inflation compensation doesn’t exactly map into inflation expectations—it includes an inflation risk premium.  We think that some of the rise in inflation compensation is due to an unwinding of something we couldn’t explain—that is, a term premium that was very low by historical standards.  To the extent that it’s the term premium rising, it could get packed into that measure of inflation compensation.  I would also note that, as Dave said, in the Michigan survey of households, longer-term inflation expectations ticked up.  In the Blue Chip consensus forecast that’s released today, longer-term inflation expectations are actually unchanged over the last month, and that covers the span of the rise in energy prices and the whiff of inflation jitters that we saw in financial markets. MR. LACKER.  Does the baseline Greenbook forecast treat inflation expectations as evolving relatively sluggishly, or are they capable of jumping?  inflation expectations have shifted, and I think we would be looking at the things that I noted earlier in trying to make that determination.  In what we’re assuming is currently happening and what has happened over the past couple of years, inflation expectations are an evolving process, not a jump process. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to turn to the international side and first thank Karen for the good work that’s in the book and your briefing.  More in the book than in the briefing, there is the note that continued expansion is taking place among our significant trading partners and around the globe. I wonder if you have a sense, since we always use the term “resource utilization,” of what global resource utilization is occurring.  I raise this issue because we assume, for example, that the supply of labor in China is infinite.  If you read the recent data, you will see that in the Pearl River Valley price pressure on labor is up.  Wages are 800 yuan—$100 a month, up from $60 a month.  Is it possible for us, as we look at the rest of the world, to place a little more emphasis not just on our net import or net export position, not just on the pressures that come from imported goods in terms of oil prices, and not just on the growth factor, but also on developing a better sense of the kind of resource utilization we’re beginning to see? The second question I have is, since goods have to get from point A to point B, do you have a sense of what’s happening with worldwide port capacity and congestion?  MS. JOHNSON.  Well, as to the first question, we have not really done a lot to address this issue, which you have raised with us before, but we are trying to give it some thought.  One thing struck me over the weekend, when Governor Kohn and I went to the BIS Governors meeting.  Certainly the sense of strong So, if I had the Greenbook to do over again, I might push people to raise global growth a little based on what I heard the others saying at those meetings. What we are observing in China is to some degree the result of deliberate policy actions that Chinese authorities have taken partly to respond to the pressures they are under internationally.  They are seeking ways, ways perhaps not based on the exchange rate, to raise domestic demand in China.  Among their concerns about how to make that happen and deal with their own perceived domestic problems is the issue of migration from the rural areas into the urban areas and the source of domestic demand arising from the huge amount of population that remains in the rural areas.  So they are looking to keep people at home on the farms, so to speak, because it is attractive to be home on the farms, and they are looking to get the people home on the farms doing more consuming as a share of the total of China. To some degree they have succeeded.  Through various tax and subsidy changes and other administrative means they have raised rural incomes.  One thing we have observed is very responsive behavior on the part of the Chinese population so that, if the attractiveness of being in one manufacturing urban area changes relative to being in another, you see labor moving in response.  Now that you see something of a change, in general, between the manufacturing urban areas versus the rural areas, you’re also seeing people willing to go back home or to stay home in the rural areas.  That is a good sign that the labor force allocation in China seems to be quite responsive to what we think of as the normal economic incentives that a market economy kicks up.  That said, it does suggest that the notion of a perfectly elastic horizontal supply curve of manufactured goods out of China is a distortion and that the curve has some slope to it.  But, of course, that is what we want, so we shouldn’t lament that outcome. Over the weekend there was some interest in talking about how strong the global economy was and how much inflation might be around the corner, not just here, but everywhere.  Nonetheless, reported food prices.  So what made Chinese inflation appear to go up was a food-price event, and what has made Chinese inflation appear to come down is a food-price event.  I’m not sensing that as yet there is a consequence of, say, this wage behavior or this relative-incomes pattern within China, in terms of a very big effect on the price at which the rest of the world can buy Chinese goods or on the availability of those goods.  But it certainly has the potential to have such an effect, and it is something for which we should try to develop more sources of information. MR. FISHER.  May I just interrupt you here to ask a question?  In terms of your BIS readings and what you came back feeling:  Do you have a sense that global resource utilization is tightening and that there is a greater inflationary impulse deriving from global resource utilization? MS. JOHNSON.  Well, it is certainly true that resource utilization in certain industrial countries—Japan, for example—is moving in that direction.  Even Europe to some degree is moving in that direction.  For the major emerging-market economies of India, China, and so forth, where we have seen the big increase in the global labor force that has been thought to lie behind some of the downward pressure on wages everywhere and some of the flatness in finished goods prices, I am not so sure I did get a sense that we are reaching some kind of capacity constraint. If anything, China surprised everybody in Q1.  The numbers that they released are on a sort of Q4-to-Q4 basis.  We translate those internally and, therefore imperfectly, into quarter-on-quarter changes, and so we have Chinese Q1 growth that is a 12, 13 percent rate.  I do not see any sign that China is slowing.  The whole debate about a hard landing in China is just gone.  So in that sense, I do not really see that we are hitting global constraints where it most matters. We probably do have a permanent terms-of-trade change—or at least an extended, persistent terms-of-trade change—in terms of raw materials as a result of a change in the composition of global countries with most emerging market countries barely growing.  I do not see that happening.  The countries that have enjoyed terms-of-trade gains because they have commodity resources are probably going to continue to enjoy them; and what they do with those resources, how they choose to consume them, or what they do with domestic investment will become, I think, an important factor in this notion of global capacity. I do not have any real new news on port capacity, bottlenecks, or shipping rates; but since nobody has been talking about these subjects for quite some time, I take no news to be good news, and I do not think bottlenecks in that area have contributed much to what we have been seeing lately. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I think we are ready now to move on to our economic go-round.  Let me remind you of our convention.  Raise one hand to be put into the queue to speak, and raise two hands if you would like to make an immediate intervention or ask a question pertaining to one of your colleague’s comments.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data on the pace of economic activity surprised me slightly to the upside, although the indications are that housing is continuing to cool.  Such an upside surprise is of concern, given that we are probably in the neighborhood of full employment and inflation is already on the high side of a range I consider consistent with price stability.  I have also been slightly surprised, and unpleasantly so, by incoming data on core inflation.   Beginning on the real side, recent data might signal greater underlying momentum in aggregate demand, portending more of the same going forward.  But other developments during the intermeeting period portend slower growth this year.  In particular, energy prices and longer-term interest rates have risen surprisingly and substantially.  Taking all these factors into account, we have marked down our forecast for real GDP growth a bit for the latter half of 2006 and for 2007.  We see growth coming in slightly below trend starting in the second half of this year and the unemployment rate moving up next several meetings. One development on which I would like to comment briefly is the rise in long-term interest rates.  Since the beginning of this year, the nominal ten-year Treasury rate is up about 75 basis points.  About 50 basis points of this increase is accounted for by a rise in the real component, at least as measured by TIPS rates.  It seems natural to assume that this increase in real long rates will restrain future growth, but the outcome for economic activity is not unambiguous:  It depends on what caused real rates to rise in the first place, and the causation is far from obvious. For example, higher long-term rates could reflect rational market expectations of a significantly stronger domestic economy over the next few years.  But such an explanation does not strike me as particularly plausible because, although recent data are slightly on the strong side, they are not dramatically strong.  Moreover, the uptick in real rates appears to be especially pronounced in implied yields at the long end of the curve—in the distant future, in periods well beyond a plausible forecast horizon. A second possibility is that higher U.S. interest rates reflect a shift in global capital flows away from the United States, perhaps due to the unwinding of the carry trade or growing concern about the U.S. current account deficit.  Such a shift might account for the sharp drop in the dollar over the same period.  In simple models, such a shift in portfolio preferences has ambiguous effects on domestic demand because the depreciation in the dollar could stimulate aggregate demand by more than higher yields depress it.  It’s not my intention to overemphasize the risk that growth will not slow.  My point is simply that, although the rise in bond rates seems likely to help slow the economy, we should not take it for granted. factors, as David mentioned, some pass-through of energy and commodity prices, or pressures from resource utilization.  Parsing the CPI report, I found it difficult to discern evidence that the uptick does reflect pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core inflation.  I would be quite concerned if the uptick reflects pressures from resource utilization and turns out to be persistent.  However, half a dozen measures of slack that we monitor suggest no noticeable change in slack since late March.  These measures also suggest that we are in the vicinity of full employment and not noticeably beyond it.  Data on both productivity and labor compensation are largely reassuring. My final comment concerns the rise in inflation compensation since our last meeting.  While the possibility of some loss of Fed credibility certainly can’t be dismissed, I believe we should not overreact.  First, the rise we’ve seen is not out of line with the typical volatility in this series.  Second, we must remember that inflation compensation includes not only expected inflation but also an inflation risk premium.  Of course, both of these elements could be higher because of a lessening of credibility.  But the inflation risk premium could also be higher because the world now strikes market participants as a riskier place, perhaps because of geopolitical concerns that have nothing to do with credibility.  Indeed, a growing perception that the world is riskier could explain both the uptick in inflation compensation due to a rise in the inflation risk premium and some of the rise in TIPS yields due to higher real interest rate risk.  Factor analysis performed by our staff suggests a strong correlation with the common factor for the term premium and longer-horizon, but not shorter-horizon, breakeven inflation rates and TIPS yields. My point is that determining what has caused inflation compensation to go up is not an easy matter, and concluding that it’s due to a lessening of credibility may be premature.  So overall, while we have revised our core inflation forecast up slightly, we continue to be fairly optimistic that inflation will percent over the next year or so seems like the most likely outcome to us. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you or your staff have a view on the breakdown between the term premium and future expected rates in terms of the far forward increase in interest rates? MS. YELLEN.  We’ve not tried to estimate an actual breakdown between those two things.  We do look at models that estimate the term premium, but we’ve done some empirical work that suggests simply that movements in inflation compensation, the inflation risk premium, and longer-term TIPS yields tend to be correlated at long horizons.  But I don’t have an estimate of that precise breakdown. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our readings on the Fifth District’s economy very much parallel those for the nation as a whole.  I’ll be brief.  Surveys show a marked pickup in manufacturing shipments and orders in March and April and ongoing growth in services activities.  Retail sales indicators edged higher in April.  The real estate market showed signs that residential activity is softening and commercial activity is firming. Our measures of District price pressures have stepped up significantly in recent weeks.  In the service sector, we ask about current price trends, and we get these quantitative measures and rates of increase.  In the service sector, the current inflation measure is back up to its post-Katrina peak and is higher than at any time since 2003.  We ask about expected six-month inflation.  For the service sector, that has drifted up since Katrina and is now at 3.2 percent, higher than at any point since our survey began in the early ’90s.  In the manufacturing sector, prices received rose 2.4 percent, also a record high, and prices paid also surged in April.  The vast majority of our contacts who have commented on this believe that higher energy prices will persist throughout 2006, and about three-quarters of them say that they will raise their prices in response. upbeat and point to continued healthy growth.  I won’t enumerate them.  Unfortunately, I think the inflation picture has become substantially more troubling to me over the intermeeting period.  The annual rate of 3.9 percent, even restricting attention to the market-based components that Governor Kohn prefers.  [Laughter] Of course, month-to-month numbers are noisy, as David indicated, but the core PCE index was up at a rate of 2.5 percent over the past three months and 2.4 percent since August.  In addition, the outlook for inflation going forward has deteriorated as well, and we have had a fairly thorough discussion in the Q&A, so I’ll skip my planned recitation of the indicators.  My sense is that inflation expectations have deteriorated markedly. I don’t want to be too alarmist.  Inflation spreads are still a bit below where they were two years ago, so I think it is possible to characterize inflation expectations as contained, although the size of the requisite container keeps getting bigger and bigger as time goes on.  [Laughter]  Right now it’s bigger than I’d like to see.  My concern is less about the current level of expected inflation than it is about how those expectations have responded to incoming data.  We saw an adverse move in inflation expectations last fall after Katrina, accompanied by conjectures that we might pause.  Inflation expectations seemed to subside as retail gasoline prices fell, but I think it helped substantially that we stuck with our rate increases and communicated pretty forcefully in the fall about our concerns about inflation. This time around, rising energy prices have led to upward revisions in market participants’ expectations about our policy path, along with upward revisions to their expectations regarding inflation.  I would have been far happier, however, had they marked up their expected policy path by more and inflation expectations rose simultaneous with our expected policy path falling.  President Yellen talked about overreacting.  Certainly no one wants to overreact, but I think in situations like this a distinct reaction is warranted.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, one issue I have with these surveys is that, when they ask about price changes, they don’t distinguish between intermediate goods and final goods.  Of course, the final goods are what we care about.  Have you tried to make that distinction in your surveys? MR. LACKER.  Yes, we do on the manufacturing side:  We have prices paid and prices received.  In the service sector, we don’t distinguish; we just ask.  And we have separate retail and nonretail service sectors.  On the manufacturing side, they are always pessimistic, so prices received never seem as though they’re going up as fast as prices paid, especially in the last couple of years.  But over time, if you look at their movements from month to month, you can get a distinct sense.  They really moved up markedly in the fall, tapered off a little and softened in the winter, and now have moved up markedly again and are at or above where they were before. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most of my business contacts indicated that overall economic activity remains on a solid footing and that resource utilization has tightened further.  Both of the major temporary-help firms headquartered in our District said that hiring remains strong nationwide.  They continued to say that skilled workers are in short supply.  This topic was also on the minds of our contacts in manufacturing and construction.  As I’ve noted previously, we’ve heard a few reports from manufacturers that labor shortages were causing delays in supplier deliveries.  Strengthened labor demand, however, has not yet spread to lower-skilled workers.  So while wages for skilled individuals continue to increase briskly, pay rates for other workers are up only modestly. problems with the costs and availability of trucking and rail shipping capacity, and a manufacturer of drilling equipment reported supply disruptions because its vendors were heavily backlogged.  Several contacts noted that price pressures have intensified for many commodities, as we’ve discussed before.  Of course, everyone was talking about the surge in energy costs.  Some retailers noted that sales had slowed, and they attributed the softness to higher energy prices.  Others were concerned about the impact of energy going forward.  In contrast, our manufacturing contacts reported that they generally have no plans to scale back production in response to the recent increases. There is not much new to report on the Delphi negotiations.  The period for Delphi workers to sign up for early retirement is just starting.  Delphi, General Motors, and the UAW hope that many will accept the buyout.  This would leave fewer union workers vulnerable to being laid off as Delphi downsizes, which would make the negotiations easier for all the parties involved. On a final note, several of my directors continue to be concerned about the amount of liquidity in financial markets.  They say prices and terms for more and more deals are bordering on speculative. Turning to the outlook, we’ve had quite a bit of news since our last meeting.  Much of it suggests increased risks on the inflation front.  Of course, the March reading on core inflation was just one month, but the twelve-month change in core PCE inflation is now back up to 2 percent.  And as President Lacker said, the six-month change is now up to 2.4 percent.  Moreover, energy prices have jumped again.  The dollar has weakened a bit more, and inflation expectations have risen.   In response to the latest data, the forecasts from our indicator models of inflation have moved up some.  Currently, these project 2007 core PCE inflation between 2 percent and 2.4 percent.  To be sure, things are far from getting out of hand:  Resource utilization measures currently are only modestly on the tight side, and we are all well aware of the uncertainty surrounding those measures.  Furthermore, growth have been rising. Looking at the markup of prices over labor costs, one would think that there’s plenty of room for profit margins to absorb higher wages.  But as Bill Poole suggested in the issue we discussed before, the business people I talked to haven’t gotten that message.  Their attempts to maintain margins in the face of increasing costs represent an upside risk to the inflation outlook.  So I agree with the upward nudge to the Greenbook inflation forecast, but I’d go a bit further.  Given the Greenbook path for the funds rate, I think core inflation of 2¼ percent is a more reasonable point forecast for 2007. In terms of growth, the expansion still appears solid.  The softening in housing that we have been anticipating is more obvious now.  There’s a possibility that moderation might turn to something bigger, but I don’t see this as a large risk.  Of course, $3-a-gallon gasoline should restrain demand somewhat, and we’ll need to keep a close eye on how consumers respond to yet another hit to their purchasing power.  But employment continues to rise at a good pace, generating healthy increases in income, which should support household demand.  Businesses are supporting spending on capital goods, and growth prospects abroad continue to suggest some optimism on export demand.  So I think growth will average around potential over the course of the projection period. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, at the last meeting, I reported the comments of a CEO of a big box retailer who said the economy was “amazing.”  I suppose the best summary of what I’m about to report to you in terms of my readings in the field—this time I assiduously talked to twenty-five CEOs and COOs, and I’ll give you that list separately so I won’t bore you with the details—the economy is even more amazing than it was before.  That is, we see a shift taking place from consumption-driven to ugly head and that inflation expectations are higher as we go through time. Let me give you some specifics.  According to reports from shippers that I’ve talked to, the shipping market for bulk and containers is stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.  Karen, there is a report, which is why I would like to see a more definitive version, of fleet utilization running well over 90 percent and waiting time in ports increasing significantly.  My rail contacts report that rail traffic as of April 22 is up 4½ percent for the year.  They expect higher growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  UPS is planning for “some moderation in volume” but “hasn’t seen any sign yet of a slowdown, discounting for the late Easter.”  An airline with 80 million passengers reports very strong advance bookings through July in every region of the country. Some pressure from gas going over $3 at the pump has been reported, particularly in the past two weeks, by the retailers at every price point; and yet there’s an interesting shift taking place.  For example, JCPenney now runs a billion dollars worth of sales through the Internet.  That growth rate is increasing; it’s 23 percent.  This way of presenting their products to the market helps to offset the oil price effect. In the IT sector, the book-to-bill ratio of the large semiconductors is still greater than 1.  Companies like EDS and other “productivity enhancers” are seeing increased demand for their products, which they interpret as a vote of confidence.  We’re also seeing increased demand for storage capacity, which many would interpret as a vote of confidence going forward in the business picture. From the largest bank in our District, the report is that volume is “so good you’re able to eat it.”  They report, by the way—I don’t want to give offense to any sector of our economy—that the only people having credit problems are personal injury lawyers in Texas because of the reform that has taken place there.  But other than that, the credits, as reported by banks, look to be in very, very good shape. built 400,000 homes thus far.  I’ve expanded that to another builder of similar size.  The cancellation rate now, David, is up to 40 percent—a key indicator.  However, it has shifted around the country, and in our state they report that you’d have to be a princess on a pea to feel any discomfort with the Texas housing market.  It is booming, unlike the Florida market—which, as you know, is cascading. As far as cost-cutting capital expansion, it continues.  Fluor reports a remarkable first-time-in-history statistic, which is that every single sector that they deal with, and every one of their product lines, is on the uptick.  I want to report one particular project in summary that just puts things in perspective.  Texas Utilities is about to announce a $10 billion coal-processing plant.  This is conversion from coal to electricity.  It will generate 40,000 jobs in our state to construct and 21,000 permanent jobs.  But here’s the interesting statistic.  It’ll take 12 million manhours and womanhours to construct.  The CEO reports that ten years ago all those jobs would have been American jobs.  Only 4 million of the manhours and womanhours to construct this project will be American jobs; the rest of the construction will be done in China or in Germany.  Five years ago, it would have taken six years to build.  According to the CEO, they’ll build it in three years, and to go to President Moskow’s point, yesterday the CEO of a large—as we used to say—“underwriting house” in New York offered to assume all the financing.  They will finance at 100 percent nonrecourse.  There’s a lot of liquidity in the system. We are concerned about prices.  We see pricing power creeping upward in the reports we’re getting from the CEOs.  As you know, our compass in Dallas is the trimmed mean PCE.  It’s running at a rate of about 2.3 percent.  At some point in the future, Mr. Chairman, I would like to provide a memo on that particular measure of inflation, which we consider to be a more reliable indicator of future inflation.  But the point is that, in all of our soundings among these operators of businesses, they are feeling increasing price pressure, both at the intermediate level and at the consumer level. usually has 200 or 300 jobs maximum outstanding and looks for highly trained engineers, is now trying to fill 1,000 of those jobs and having trouble filling them.  Second, at the other end of the range, 7-Eleven reports that in Florida, the Great Lakes District, and the Chesapeake Bay area, they cannot find $7- to $8-an-hour sales clerks.  They are having to raise their prices. In short, we view this economy to be something like a 2006 BMW Z4 Roadster—Bluetooth-enabled, by the way.  It’s complex, it’s highly integrated, it’s a technically advanced machine that apparently cannot help itself from exceeding the speed limit.  [Laughter]  Thank you. MS. BIES.  My husband will attest to that.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, you don’t see any drag from high interest rates or energy prices on this overall strength? MR. FISHER.  The two house builders together built 700,000 homes; as you know, that industry is consolidating.  I asked them point blank whether the rates are killing them.  Now, you have to take this with some skepticism, but they said no.  The real issue here is that this highly speculative medium is becoming incredibly liquid.  There is obviously a self-feeding mechanism, and the statistic that probably illustrates it best is Palm Beach, Florida.  Last year, 6,000 homes were listed for sale.  This year, as of last week, 17,000 homes are listed for sale.  So what you have is a secondary market that is being speculated with, and advance liquidity provided by the financing mechanisms, and a lot of turmoil in that portfolio.  This type of entrepreneur almost always sees things as better than they actually are, and I do pay very close attention to the kind of data that we’re seeing.  But interest rates don’t seem to be the key issue, though obviously they kick in because of the way mortgages are priced.   As far as the consumer is concerned—and Bill and I both talk to Wal-Mart in depth—they are obviously more worried about gas prices than they are about interest rates.  So I have a bit of ourselves, when we can’t talk to anybody else.  The net feeling is that growth is stronger than we’re forecasting, and inflation—I agree with President Lacker and the others—is making me feel uncomfortable. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m still trying to understand that comment about the schizophrenia.  [Laughter]  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m not going to try to help you on that one.  [Laughter]  I’m going to try to be very brief here because I want to reserve more of my fair share of the time to the policy discussion.  One of the problems with the anecdotal reports, of course, is the unsystematic way in which we do them.  I’m well aware that some of the answers you get depend on the way you phrase the questions.  Some of my contacts say that the economy is doing fine, no real problems.  One of my contacts from the trucking industry said that the economy looks pretty stable—“boringly normal” is the way he put it.  I don’t have any contacts, though, who say that they see any sign of weakness.  They’re not complaining about signs of weakness, and some of the contacts are saying that things are pretty doggone strong.  So that’s my attempt to filter the observation. Now, let me just give you a couple of particularly interesting anecdotes.  My Wal-Mart contact talked about construction costs.  He said even in Indiana, which is not known as one of the great growth states in this country— MR. MOSKOW.  Wait a minute.  I have to make a two-handed intervention on that one.  [Laughter] MR. POOLE.  Okay.  Anyway, he said that their construction costs—for a store, I guess—have come in 27 percent above expectations.  Their construction costs are even higher in the Gulf Coast area.  first time in eight years of talking with him that I’ve heard any comment like that.  He said that some of the raises are part of the Wal-Mart, I’ll call it “social/political,” agenda because of all the controversy about Wal-Mart.  But he said about 125 of these were market driven, that they have plenty of labor in rural areas and in urban areas, but they are developing a labor supply problem for their stores in suburban areas.  Suburban areas are strong. I have received some unsolicited e-mail messages—well, I guess to be fair they’re sort of solicited.  [Laughter]  These are from two directors:  “Heavy construction industry is really hot.  In the past month, I have received reports of a second round of capital cost increases of 25 to 40 percent in the refining industry, and the same for construction of large power plants.  These estimates follow similar increases last summer.”  Another message discussed pressures on the cost of construction materials.  I won’t read the whole thing.  It says, “We believe we are now on the front side of a real surge in prices that will mainly affect highly volatile commodity building products—steel, copper, aluminum, and zinc.  However, if it is sustained, it will ripple across a broad range of more-manufactured products.” Now, very briefly, I’ve made a list of what I think are classic inflation warning signs, and I’ll just rattle these off very quickly.  Inflation expectations—we’ve talked about that.  Dollar depreciation.  Commodity prices are really breaking out of a trading range that has prevailed for about fifteen years—if you look at the chart in the Greenbook Part 2, you’ll see that.  The surge in construction costs—I think there is a building boom indicating business confidence, and, of course, a direct source of aggregate demand.  Relatively low risk spreads, making it easy for firms to raise capital.  Strong stock market.  Strong corporate profits.  From our anecdotal information, some increase in pricing power.  And a worldwide boom.  There is growth in almost every region of the world, and, of course, that translates to at least eventually.  I’ll stop there.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole, did your contacts have anything to say about the issue of whether the strength in retail sales was a seasonal factor or something else? MR. POOLE.  Wal-Mart, of course, follows those numbers very closely.  My contact said that it’s very difficult to sort out what happens when Easter moves the way it does, particularly this time.  He said he would just take March and April together.  Those two months together came in at 3.8 percent, same-store comparison year over year, and they had 3.9 in their plan—3.8 versus 3.9.  That came in just about exactly as they had anticipated.  He did say that they are observing a clear response to the gasoline price increases.  They are seeing fewer trips to the store, a decline or less growth in the number of sales tickets, and an increased number of sales on each sales ticket, which is a logical thing for consumers to do. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Current economic conditions are fair to good in New England.  Consumers report rising confidence, at least in the current situation.  Manufacturers report solid domestic and international demand.  Business confidence is also good relative to the current situation.  Unemployment claims and online job postings suggest continuing positive employment momentum.  Northern-tier tourism was hurt by lackluster winter weather, but reportedly tourism in Boston has been quite strong.  And even with the poor winter season, tax revenues have grown considerably above budget in all but Rhode Island. On the not-so-hot side, residential real estate markets apparently have slowed, particularly at the high end, with rising inventories of unsold expensive homes.  Reportedly, however, more moderately priced homes continue to sell, though transaction volumes for the region as a whole are trailing off.  price indexes, the last ones of which we had for the final quarter of last year.  More-recent anecdotes also suggest that they have been increasing.  However, the rates of increase are down to single digits.  To some contacts, the market, though slower, seems healthier and more realistic. From a wide range of contacts I have spoken with since the last meeting, I want to highlight three concerns.  First, rising costs for energy, transportation, and raw materials are pushing price increases.  These are more likely to be tolerated by customers than in the recent past.  And firms that say they are unable to pass on such increases report that they expect considerable bottom-line deterioration as a result.  Second, skilled labor across a wide range of industries is harder to find and expensive, though planned overall wage increases do not seem to be larger than a year ago.  So there is some issue here of skilled labor versus unskilled labor differentials.  Finally, there is a general worry, despite pretty good current economic conditions, that energy and energy-related costs will eat into consumer demand and, combined with the flattening in housing markets, will affect growth prospects. Now, on the national scene, our forecast is just about the same as the Greenbook’s.  Growth slows for the rest of this year to next and in ’07 is slightly below potential.  Unemployment rises slightly, even with continued pretty good job growth.  Inflation first rises and then falls.  It’s the same general forecast we’ve had for a while.  But the question is where the risks to this forecast are.  To me they seem to have risen, perhaps on both sides, but I’d say they’re a bit tilted to higher price growth.  Q1 growth was clearly above expectations.  Some of this was frontloaded into January.  April employment was on the slow side; there is some evidence of slowing in housing markets, though prices continue to rise; and household wealth, including stock market wealth, is rising as well. The longer end of the yield curve has turned up, tightening financial conditions somewhat, though corporate profits remain strong and credit spreads remain narrow.  It’s possible we’re seeing trajectory for growth is downward, how much and how fast remains uncertain and is a part more of the forecast than of the current picture. On the other hand, although incoming core inflation data have tracked only a bit above what we had expected, I’m not comfortable with what might be called the inflation atmosphere.  With inflation compensation and inflation expectations rising, the dollar falling, and gasoline prices around $3 a gallon, it seems to me that inflation risks really have tilted somewhat.  I know that each of these may turn out to be transitory.  It’s also true that, as yet, indications of wage pressures have been mixed, and while productivity growth has been trending lower, it remains quite healthy.  The global competition that characterized much of the past ten years remains healthy, and profit margins are wide enough on average to absorb the rising input costs related to a growing world. Still, anticipating core PCE price growth at 2½ percent, as the Greenbook does for this quarter, makes me at least pause.  Given the six-month and the three-month rates of growth in core PCE, a slowing in rates of price growth, while expected, still is only part of the forecast. In sum, although the forecast is rosy—perhaps a bit too rosy—risks to the realization of that forecast appear to have risen.  Some of these may be on the downside, but we are also at a point where estimating the economy’s remaining capacity is difficult, and the atmosphere of the inflation picture has changed.  So though I don’t want to overreact or be accused of doing so, I am less sure than I was at our last meeting about both where we are and where we need to be. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Based on the reports from my directors and my business contacts in the Fourth District, the relatively broad-based growth of the first quarter appears to the moderating trend of the Greenbook baseline projection. To put it in terms used by the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment measures, the current condition index is high, but the expectations index is falling.  I was reminded by my staff as we were preparing for this meeting that real-time data on real economic growth are difficult to assess.  At the end of our rate-increase cycle in 2000, the GDP figures were providing unreliable signals about the underlying strength of the economy.  We had a second quarter that had real growth of more than 6 percent.  We were forecasting, and even saw in the advance figures a very strong third quarter, and yet we had negative growth in that quarter. Comments I hear about price pressures contain some mixed messages.  I don’t hear many complaints about price pressures except for the obvious ones about the energy-related costs and material shortages in construction-related businesses.  However, I am hearing concerns about the persistence of these costs and the possibility that they may have negative consequences for both inflation and overall business conditions.   The consequences of the energy shocks for prices are already apparent.  At our November meeting, I agreed with the Board staff projection that we would, at about this time, find ourselves facing some pass-through in our core inflation measures from some of the previous energy-price increases.  At that time, however, it also appeared that headline inflation would be coming down at this point.  Obviously, the current Greenbook suggests that recent oil shocks have taken that scenario away from us, at least for the immediate future, and the tick-up in expected core inflation is now even further away from my comfort zone than before. That said, based on what I’m hearing from my directors and business contacts, the Greenbook’s assessment of current conditions and baseline projections going forward seem about right to me.  But I and that inflationary pressures might be larger or even more persistent than I expect.  If we can take any encouragement from this, it would be that similar sentiments were expressed during the run-up in oil and gas prices last fall, and those sentiments did abate fairly quickly when the energy market situation stabilized.  Unlike many of my colleagues who have spoken ahead of me, I do think that the risks are weighted against both of our objectives, and, obviously, that’s not a comfortable place for a monetary policymaker to be in.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to advance at a solid pace.  Growth in our region has been steadier than in the nation over the past two quarters.  Payroll employment grew in each of the three states through March, and the three-state unemployment rate is now 4½ percent.  Our business contacts in the region report increased difficulty in filling open positions.  In addition, our employment diffusion index in the business outlook survey rose sharply in April.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  In response to a special survey question in April, the majority of participants said that underlying demand for their products was increasing. On the retail side, performance looks solid.  Some of that is seasonal.  On the auto side, sales have picked up slightly, but we see some small dealerships actually going out of business.  Our retailers have expressed less concern than I’ve heard around the table about the impact of gasoline prices on their sales going forward. While initial reports of nonresidential construction contracts in our region have declined in recent months, demand for office and industrial space in the District continues to strengthen.  The office commercial construction activity is somewhat softer in our District than in the nation as a whole.  Nonetheless, our contacts do see a stronger picture this year than they did last year.  In the residential sector, home sales have slowed since the winter.  Inventories and time on the market have increased.  Demand has fallen particularly for higher-priced homes, more so than for lower-priced homes, and house-price appreciation is slowing in our region.   Prices for industrial goods are rising, and construction firms are reporting some shortages of structural materials.  Some area builders are starting to stockpile copper, aluminum, and steel for upcoming projects.  Employers in a number of industries in our region report that they have paid higher salaries for workers this year compared with hires in similar positions last year.  At this time of the year, we usually are traveling around the District and conferring with bankers and other businesses as we’re doing our annual field meetings.  Over the past week, we were in the typically most depressed areas of our District—the far western part of our District—and for the first time in many years I was hearing optimism about the future and reports of an actual substantial decline in the unemployment rates in those areas. Turning to the national conditions, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline.  However, we see somewhat more economic strength and somewhat higher inflation going forward.  We also note that many forecasters have also revised up their forecasts of the second quarter based on the strength of incoming data.  Business spending and manufacturing continue to show strength.  Notwithstanding the April unemployment report, which came in lower than expected, employment remains strong.  Monthly gains have accelerated to an average of 173,000 jobs this year, compared with 165,000 last year.  Employment growth will support consumer spending even as house-price appreciation slows.  The rising gasoline prices will have a damping effect but probably not a orderly.  With the economy expected to remain at full employment and with labor markets tight, we expect hourly compensation growth to accelerate over the forecast period, but not dramatically so. I recognize that higher oil prices and higher long-term interest rates pose a downside risk to growth and that the downturn in housing and the monetary policy tightening already in the pipeline could prove to be a bigger drag than anticipated.  But in my view, given the underlying strength of the economy, the risks to growth are roughly balanced or perhaps even tilted modestly to the upside. I have somewhat more concern about inflation over the intermeeting period.  It’s true that we haven’t seen an acceleration in core inflation measured year over year.  But at shorter horizons, as has been previously mentioned, we’ve seen a marked uptick in core inflation.  In addition, inflation forecasts have been revised up, reflecting the recent higher-than-expected inflation data and the view that higher oil prices might add to inflationary pressures.  Longer-run inflation expectations, as measured by the TIPS and the Michigan survey, as reported earlier, are apparently up somewhat, which is troubling to me.  Higher productivity growth will help to keep inflation in check.  With inflation running at the top of the range that I consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of resource utilization, there’s a risk that stronger inflation pressures could emerge.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with our District.  Evidence from the District continues to show strong growth.  While consumer spending has shown some modest slowing, retailers remain very optimistic in our surveys about future sales, and this despite some of the recent increases in energy prices.  Manufacturing activity continues to grow solidly, and energy activity equipment. Housing markets in the District are cooling, as you’ve heard described elsewhere, and illustrate I think a potential downside risk overall.  Though it’s still high by historical standards, residential construction continues to edge downward.  Home sales were still growing modestly in most areas but not fast enough to absorb the supply of homes being brought on the market.  As a result, first-quarter inventories in the largest District markets have grown markedly relative to a year ago.  In addition, foreclosures also point to some weakening in the housing market.  I guess the most notable is a 31 percent increase in March over the previous month that pushed Colorado to the highest foreclosure rate in the nation—as reported anyway.  One factor behind the increase is the unusually widespread use of interest-only mortgages in that state.  However, nonresidential construction in Colorado and elsewhere in the District appears to be taking up some of the slack from the housing side. Let me turn to the nation and try to be brief.  The contours of the outlook that we have are similar to what I reported at our last meeting and not unlike that from the Greenbook.  Several factors suggest that the economy will slow over the forecast period.  First, as I’ve suggested before, the removal of policy accommodation continues to have its effect.  Second, long-term interest rates have, as others reported, risen noticeably.  Third, energy prices continue to increase, reducing consumer purchasing power.  Finally, we’ve been forecasting a slowdown in housing, but there is a risk that the slowdown could be actually larger than expected. Of course, there are counterbalancing factors that would show continued growth.  Those have been outlined by others, but certainly the past stimulus in the amount of liquidity in the market has its effects.  In addition, we are seeing improvements in employment and in income, which should help keep the economy moving forward. but it is not a surprise.  We have been expecting last year’s increase in energy prices to feed into a temporary rise in core inflation.  We’ve seen that.  More recent increases in energy are going to complicate that situation. So in the end, as we prepare for the next portion of this discussion this morning, I would agree with all my colleagues on one thing—monetary policy is going to be much more difficult in the next few months.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, regional data and anecdotal information from our various contacts suggest that the Southeast region economy continues to have good momentum.  Let me comment on just a few specific areas where what we’re seeing in our District Regional employment gains continue to be strong, and we’re hearing more and more stories of tighter labor markets for a number of skills, mostly in construction and skilled professional positions, and compensation is going up significantly in a number of those areas.  At the same time, we also hear over and over about the lengths to which businesses are going to offset those wage increases with productivity gains, most making greater use of technology and process re-engineering. Like others, we’re continuing to see evidence of cooling in house sales and prices and a growing inventory of unsold homes in some of our markets.  The CEO of one of the nation’s largest home builders, who is headquartered in Atlanta and with whom I talk regularly, explained that a number of factors, in his view, have come together to precipitate that slowing—overbuilding, higher mortgage rates, a retreat of housing speculators, earlier conversion of many rental apartments to for-sale units, and now the wait-and-see attitude among those who still expect to purchase at some point.  He reinforced my the frothy coastal markets, like South Florida, that have seen a significant adjustment.  The high cost of energy and industrial commodities is very much on people’s minds in our area, but the pass-through of those costs still seems to be limited.  Clearly, transportation costs are up significantly because of cost pass-through.  Some construction projects, including a few that were substantially sold out in the preconstruction phase, are being canceled and deposits are being returned because the construction material costs would make projects unprofitable.  An example of those cost pressures in construction:  A large builder told me last week that what he paid for copper wiring most recently was four times what he paid just a year ago. As an example of energy price pass-through, one member of our Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor Advisory Council related a story last week that is just too good not to share.  He said he was at a neighborhood gas station, in the middle of filling the tank of his big SUV, when the pumps suddenly stopped across the entire gas station.  An attendant came on the speaker system and announced that they were instituting an increase of ten cents a gallon.  [Laughter]  And the ringer is that the increase would apply not only to the remainder of the gas he was about to pump but what he had already pumped.  [Laughter]  Good story.  What I would call real-time pass-through.  [Laughter] While overall performance seems solid, the outlook is not nearly so bright in the hurricane-affected areas, with which we’re still struggling.  The situation is especially difficult in New Orleans, where the damage was due largely to flooding and standing water, compared with the Mississippi coast, where damage was due to storm surge and wind.  Debris cleanup and infrastructure repairs still dominate the reconstruction efforts.  Even the demolition of damaged structures in New Orleans has barely begun, and there are few signs of any rebuilding in many of the more heavily flooded areas of the city.  New Orleans lost not only more than 200,000 jobs but also about the same number of homes, either the jobs or the homes, and less than one-half of the pre-Katrina population is now back living in the city.   There are a number of reasons for the lack of progress, including complex levee repairs; the need to redraw flood plains and set permit policies; political in-fighting; a shortage of workers and supplies; and insurance complications—just to mention a few.  For instance, the Corps of Engineers, which has some 150 people working out of our New Orleans Fed office, managing their projects, expects to repair the levee system by June 1, which is the official start of the new hurricane season.  But those repairs will bring the levees only to their pre-Katrina status, and longer-term solutions and spending will take years to implement.  Even after eight months, oil and gas supplies still remain disrupted.  Just under 23 percent of crude oil and 13 percent of natural gas production in the Gulf remain shut in, and the critical Critical to the slow recovery process is the lack of housing for either returning or temporary workers.  Without housing, the economies in the affected areas will be slow to recover.  There are practical realities that also need to be faced.  People can’t continue to live in FEMA trailers forever, and those who are doing so are beginning to show signs of stress.  We have twelve of our own employees in trailers in our parking lot.  We’ve come to the view, which I’ve talked about before, that the experience from our past hurricanes may provide little guidance about either the pace or the path of recovery.  We’re monitoring developments very carefully and also initiating some research projects to better understand the recovery process. Turning to the national economy, I’m encouraged that our collective forecast for a rebound in the first quarter was in fact on target, but I am less certain about the path going forward.  I, like others, see both upside and downside risks to real output and employment.  Major downside risks continue to be potential consequences of a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in housing; and the impact of both short-term and longer-term interest rates, which have risen. Other key factors that could result in better-than-expected outcomes lie in the potential increase in investment spending; a surge in nonresidential and commercial construction; continued strength in consumer spending, particularly in durables and autos; and a pickup in inventory accumulation.  While my own staff’s forecasts for this meeting show a slowdown in the second half of the year, I’m not terribly confident about the specific sources from which that slowing will eventually come.   Of greater concern to me, however, is the inflation outlook.  The core measures continue to be in the upper range of what most of us have indicated is acceptable.  The trends in these and headline inflation measures are data that the public observe and that affect inflation expectations, and it behooves us not to ignore them in favor of more-benign forecasts.  I am, therefore, concerned that we not do anything today to suggest that we have lost focus on either inflation or the way in which we intend to achieve our inflation objective.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economy continues to perform well, and the ongoing expansion is broadly based.  Given that summary, let me just comment on three particular areas, beginning with a few things of interest that came out of a breakfast we had a couple of weeks ago with the leaders of the Twin Cities financial community. First, hiring costs reportedly are rising significantly in order to attract college graduates and those with advanced degrees.  This has implications for salaries more broadly because of internal compression and retention issues—perhaps not a surprise given the duration of the expansion and the gains in employment over the past several years. distinctions between the activities of commercial banks and much more specialized firms like hedge funds, venture capitalists, and private equity firms are diminishing, as the last group is invading the banks’ turf, especially in providing credit of one form or another to business.  This was also a theme at a financial institutions dinner I attended a few weeks earlier.  These competitive pressures may help to explain the results from the latest survey of senior loan officers indicating further easing of standards and terms for C&I (commercial and industrial) loans. The third area I want to comment on is housing.  Data through April show that activity in the District in terms of starts and permits is running so far this year at about the same pace that it ran last year.  However, according to a variety of anecdotal reports, speculative building is slowing dramatically if not stopping altogether, and the high end of the housing market, interestingly enough, is doing better, perhaps far better, than the lower tiers.  There are reports of price softening in the middle part of the market.  Given the volume of projects that are currently under way in the District, I would judge that the inventory of unsold homes, especially of condominiums, will continue to rise, and the pace of price increase will moderate further, if not turn negative in some markets. As to the national economy, growth appears to me to be healthy and is likely to be well sustained as best I can determine.  Still, I think that there are a few straws in the wind that suggest that some deceleration is in the offing, including the evolution of housing activity and the diminution of the positive wealth effect, at least from that source.  I do not want to exaggerate that effect at this moment.  It is based largely on what we are seeing in the most recent data, but the anecdotes, at least that I am getting, are consistent with that.  Also, while it seems pretty clear that the economy has weathered the run-up in energy prices well, we should not lose sight of its negative implications for real incomes and ultimately for spending.  As for inflation, here it seems to me that uncertainty about the outlook has increased, as the core numbers have deteriorated.  Still, in my experience, it is not a good idea to overemphasize high-frequency observations, and as a consequence of that, I am not ready yet to raise my inflation forecast. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The basic contours of our forecast are essentially unchanged since March and are very similar to the Greenbook’s.  However, the balance of risks has changed a little in our view, somewhat to the upside on inflation.  But as in March, we expect core PCE inflation to run a little over 2 percent in ’06 and to moderate slightly below that in ’07 as tighter policy works to slow overall demand growth.  We expect real growth to rise in the vicinity of its potential rate—3¼, 3½ percent—throughout ’07.  So we are a little higher than the Greenbook in that sense. As before, this forecast rests on some important assumptions:  that little or no slack is left in resource utilization, that inflation expectations are held in check, and that term premiums remain relatively low by historical standards.  The recent moves in medium-term inflation expectations and the rise in the other components of forward interest rates cast some doubts on these last two assumptions.  For these and other reasons, we see a little more uncertainty around our central forecast than we did in our last meeting. However, on the growth outlook, on balance the recent data seem to confirm the picture of real GDP moderating toward potential.  We face the familiar sources of risk to the downside, but not all the risks are to the downside.  We may be underestimating the momentum in final demand growth.  I think it is important to note that it is hard to find evidence in credit spreads or in equity prices of a substantial growth slowdown in prospect. On inflation, recent developments are not all that dark, but neither have they been entirely reassuring.  Let me just go through the factors that we think are critical to the outlook on the inflation side.  Almost every measure of underlying inflation that we look at is now above the level we generally associate even with interest rates close to long-run measures of equilibrium, the staff forecast does not anticipate much moderation in core inflation over the two-year or even three-year or four-year period.  Compensation growth does not yet appear to have accelerated significantly, and the growth of unit labor costs has remained reassuringly moderate.  However, compensation to us seems likely to strengthen, and it is unlikely that productivity growth is going to accelerate significantly from current levels.  Demand growth is still probably running a bit above potential here and in large parts of the world economy; with real short-term rates still quite low around the world and monetary policy only just beginning to tighten in many of those economies, global pressure on resource utilization may intensify or at least continue at its current intensity rather than moderate.  And the rise in energy prices and commodity prices, of course, suggests a fair amount of strength in global demand. Our assumption that energy prices follow the futures curve means that our forecast is, of course, still vulnerable as it has been over the past three years to further upside surprises.  It would be easier to discount this risk if we could determine with confidence the extent to which temporary supply factors rather than unrecognized or unanticipated strength in global demand have accounted for the trajectory of energy prices over the past few years. We face a lot of uncertainty about the likely path of the dollar, and the prospect of a significantly weaker dollar adds another source of upside risk to inflation and expected future inflation.  We obviously have some uncertainty about the extent to which margins will prove flexible in the face of higher cost pressures. Finally, we have seen a material rise in long-term inflation expectations in the United States over the past several months, and this should make us somewhat less confident that we can assume that the gap between headline and core will be closed with headline moving down to core.  Inflation expectations seem in short-term expectations about U.S. monetary policy and changes in breakeven inflation rates is somewhat disconcerting, with expectations deteriorating when statements by Committee members were interpreted as lowering the probability of moves beyond our meeting today.  This pattern is more troubling than the size of the rise in medium-term inflation expectations.  And I just want to make one comment in response to something Janet said.  Even if we could tell with confidence how much of this rise in breakeven inflation was about uncertainty or inflation risk premiums and how much was actually about future expectations about inflation and even if we thought a substantial amount of that was uncertainty, it is not clear that that would be particularly reassuring in terms of credibility or in terms of its implications for monetary policy.  So underlying inflation is less contained than we would like it to be, and it is expected to moderate less than we might hope.  Both short-term and long-term measures of expectations have moved up uncomfortably, and we see somewhat greater upside risk to our inflation forecast than we did in March. Now, what might we learn over the next six weeks that would change our view about the outlook and its implications for monetary policy?  We actually think it is unlikely that data are going to provide us with very strong signals that policy is markedly off track, but there are two important things to watch.  One is the behavior of long-term inflation expectations.  If those expectations were to continue to rise, that would obviously be a source of concern; and if inflation expectations were not responsive to changes in expectations about the path of the funds rate, that would also be troubling.  On the data front, we at least will want to watch to see if the expected moderation in manufacturing activity in the United States materializes.  If, in contrast, manufacturing activity here sustains its recent pace, it might suggest that growth abroad has picked up more than we thought or that the dollar is having a bigger effect in stimulating exports than we anticipated.  These conditions would increase concern about upside risks to our central mitigating upward pressure on inflation over the forecast period. Just a few points to end on the topic of uncertainty:  Even though the fundamental news is pretty positive and reassuring, we are now at the point where the limits of our knowledge about the underlying forces that affect the outlook for aggregate demand, supply, and inflation matter more than they have in the recent past.  Relatively small differences, differences well within the limits of our knowledge about trend growth and productivity or employment or other factors, have more impact on our choices about monetary policy in the near term than they would have had over the past two years.   What should we conclude from the substantial rise in real forward rates that we have seen over the past few months?  This move, which has occurred across the major economies, brings expected real rates more in line with long-term averages, reducing, if not eliminating, the anomalistic line we had such trouble understanding.  Now, does this mean we have less to do in terms of future tightening than we thought?  have to do more to make up for that going forward.  The fact that we cannot fully explain why these measures of expected real rates have moved around as much as they have just adds to the uncertainty we face today about how tight policy actually is.  It is also a bit of a puzzle that measures of uncertainty about future interest rates have not increased very much, and I do think it is important that we try to continue encouraging—it is uncomfortable to say this—or to at least avoid discouraging an increase in uncertainty that is more commensurate with what we are experiencing ourselves.  [Laughter]  Monetary policy works through expectations, but our job is harder when we are not truly sure what we want to do to those expectations.  Trying to make sure that we are not pushing down uncertainty as we continue to make sure that the markets understand that we’re going to work to keep inflation low and stable remains our principal challenge.  Thank you. concentrated, and therefore, liquidity issues sometimes play a role in these high-frequency movements. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I agree.  I am not sure that the movements are that large and that you can attribute that much to these differences, but I do think you want to look carefully at what happens to those expectations when expectations change about monetary policy in the near term.  It is that pattern which is somewhat disconcerting. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Olson. MR. OLSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mid-May in an election year is a good time to look at the effect of the fiscal budget on the economy.  In an election year, any legislation that has not largely moved toward passage by Memorial Day likely is not going to happen.  We have seen reports of federal receipts received to this point, and we have a good idea about what the budget impact would be. The staff estimate now is that the 2006 budget deficit will be about $100 billion less than the original estimate of the Administration.  That would be equal to 2.2 percent of GDP in ’06, compared with 2.6 percent in ’05.  The improvement is largely revenue driven; as David indicated, government spending is up.  Through April, revenues are up 15 percent from ’05 and, for April and May, up 25 percent over the previous year.  Reasons for the increase will not be entirely known for a while, but there are several candidates.  David Wilcox and others suggested capital gains—although if you use as benchmarks the distributed capital gains for mutual funds or the capital gains that may have resulted from stock market activity in ’05, it seems unlikely to be a strong candidate.  Capital gains from real estate investments, given the exclusion allowed for couples selling a primary residence, also is not a strong candidate.  So there are two other possibilities.  One is that the BEA may be underestimating the income from Sub-S corporations that is passed through to individual tax returns or from income from partnerships.  Another may be that there is a redistribution of income toward the higher tax brackets and therefore the unavoidability of the economy. On the legislative front, we have a tax bill.  An agreement was reached on a tax reconciliation bill.  It pushed out one more year the alternative minimum tax that expired in 2005 and extended for two more years the lower rates on dividends and capital gains set to expire in 2008.  There will be a second tax bill that is right now tied to the pension reform bill.  A supplemental appropriations bill has passed the House and the Senate.  The House version is at $92 billion; the Senate version, $109 billion.  The President has indicated that he would veto the Senate version should it move forward.  That would be his first veto during his term as President.  There is no indication whatsoever that any portion of the President’s tax panel’s report from last fall will be realized in any tax legislation soon or be an issue in the 2006 election.  That is not a surprise.  The tax panel members last fall indicated that, because of the timing of its release, the report was unlikely to generate legislation, and they specifically did not put the report in legislative language, indicating that they instead wanted to talk more broadly about tax policy. Budget resolutions have passed the Senate but not the House.  The House is still debating the level of the budget resolution they would want to pass for ’07.  There is more focus in this Congress than we have seen recently on budget issues.  The focus is not driven by any effort whatsoever to reimpose, for example, a PAYGO provision, but the earmarking process that had basically hijacked the appropriations process and generated some focus on roads to nowhere and bridges to nowhere has brought about a rethinking in some quarters as to whether or not there ought to be renewed budget focus. Overall, the net effect is that both spending and revenues in ’06 and probably ’07 will be back to their fifty-year averages, which is to say about 18 percent of GDP on the revenue side and 20 percent on the spending side, although the swings obviously from year to year have been very dramatic.  Thus, in the near term, there will not be a surprise effect on the budget and therefore on the economy.  However, the report frame within which those two spending areas will overwhelm the budget if not ultimately addressed—and there is no indication that will happen.  That is the report from the congressional side for now. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with many of the rest of you that inflation risks rose over the intermeeting period, though I think I see a more limited rise than I sensed from some of the comments I have heard.  Several factors do suggest higher inflation risk.  Stronger growth than expected has left resource utilization a little higher than we thought—only a touch, I think, but still higher.  The core CPI and PCE data were disappointing—were higher than anticipated.  That, however, did follow several months in which those data came in lower than we had expected.  And if you look at the Greenbook’s 2006 projection, it reverses a downward revision from last time.  That is not to say it is not worrisome, but we were revising down for a while, and now we have had an upward revision. I think the commodity price increases are hard to understand, especially outside the energy area, where you can think about supply disruptions.  Both the energy prices and the commodity prices could feed through to a limited extent into headline inflation.  I think they do indicate, at the very least, that global demand has continued to be quite strong.  In that regard, they would add to global inflation risks. The decline in the dollar is a bit worrisome.  The pass-through to import prices has been very, very small over recent decades.  But to the extent that the lower dollar is not passed through to import prices, it would be squeezing the profits of those people who are exporting to the United States, and I think, through either channel, this suggests at least a slight reduction in the competitive pressures on domestic producers—not big, but a slight reduction. We did have a small uptick in inflation expectations looked at through the markets or the Michigan survey.  However, those expectations are still in the range of recent years, and I can recall a number of then come back down again, particularly after energy prices leveled out. None of these signs of higher inflation are very significant in and of themselves or if they were taken one by one; but taken together, they cannot be dismissed.  They do suggest at least a small rise in inflation expectations and a small rise in inflation risk that could start pushing up underlying inflation further. That said, the data we have received over the intermeeting period should give us a little more confidence that conditions are being put in place or are in train to limit these risks and to keep the upside risk limited.  The trajectory of information over the intermeeting period, especially on consumption and housing, points to quite a bit of moderation of growth in the second quarter.  We are looking at 3-point-something, and the issue is what the point-something is; it is not 4-point-something or 5-point-something.  Housing market information, I think, confirms that there is a slowdown in process that will restrain aggregate demand going forward.  Sales have bounced around a lot, but inventories have risen substantially by any measure.  That is going to be weighing on prices.  The price data are ambiguous and hard to read.  If you take a heroic leap and start seasonally adjusting the existing house prices on a month-by-month basis instead of a twelve-month basis, it looks as though they have been flattening out.  But we will get better data later.  If, indeed, prices are flattening out, we have not yet really seen that effect on consumption.  So in that sense, the tightening of policy and the flattening-out of housing prices are still in the pipeline. Higher long-term interest rates:  Some of that increase is an endogenous response to global growth and would require a higher path of short-term rates to keep inflation under control, but some of it is in the risk premium.  The extent to which the risk premium has risen will damp demand for any given course of monetary policy.  The energy-price increase will contribute to moderating growth of domestic demand, provided that we do not allow that energy-price increase to reduce real interest rates. mixed, but I have interpreted them on balance to suggest that pressures on businesses from labor cost developments are muted.  The ECI is certainly consistent with that, and so are four-quarter changes in compensation per hour and unit labor costs.  The markup of price over unit labor cost actually increased from a very high level to an even higher level.  I agree with President Poole that businesses will not voluntarily give up that markup, but we do have a recent experience if you look in the late ’90s.  That that the economy was growing with some vigor.  You can see that on page 39 of the Greenbook.  So perhaps we need to think about that episode and how it happened.  Certainly we have a precedent for vigorous growth and declining markup absorbing rising compensation costs. So where does that leave me overall?  I agree with the staff.  The most likely outcome—given the structure of interest rates, financial conditions, markets, and a flattening of energy prices—is for stable underlying inflation, core PCE to stay in the neighborhood of 2 percent, where it has been since early 2004.  But I am a little more nervous about the stability than I was at the last meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparing for the meeting, one of the things I focused on was the graph that I like that tracks the staff forecasts over time because I am really torn between where I see growth going and where I see inflation expectations.  In looking at the graph, one can clearly see, if you look back through Greenbooks to September ’05, that staff forecasts of core PCE inflation have been basically flat whereas real GDP growth forecasts for this year have increased quite a bit.  The ’07 numbers are stable at a lower inflation rate and a lower growth rate. But what troubles me so much, and somebody already mentioned it, is how much the various indicators of core inflation have picked up over recent periods in the actual data.  As President Lacker percent.  If you look at core GDP prices over the whole of last year, you are running at just under 3 percent over that period; and that is without what we cannot quite measure yet, which is how much energy prices are passing through.  The longer companies see that energy prices are going to remain high or go even higher—instead of being just a one-shot hurricane effect—the more likely we are to see some of these prices being passed through.  So I am getting concerned about whether the lagged effects of the monetary policy changes so far are going to be enough to moderate the inflation that we are now observing to reach the goal of lower core inflation numbers in ’07. On the real side, one area that I think is critical is the housing market.  As you all know, I have continued to worry about what is going on in housing and mortgages and have wanted to give you another perspective on what we are observing.  Most of you are well aware that we put out some supervisory guidance for comment awhile back on nontraditional mortgage loans, which include various forms of interest-only, adjustable-rate, negative-amortization mortgages.  If you look at the 2005 earnings reports of the large mortgage banks and the large savings and loans that do mortgage lending, these institutions have a really striking amount of interest rate risk embedded in their negative amortization loans.  As you know, most of the product is securitized and sold.  So the relative share of these products originated in the last couple of years that are on the banks’ books is small overall.  But the numbers have gotten so bad that now the setters of accounting standards want banks to disclose how much interest income they are recognizing as income that they have not collected, through this negative amortization.  In other words, they bill the customer for this interest, but instead of making the customer give them the cash every month, they just add the amount to the outstanding balance and it creates negative amortization.  For some of these big organizations, the amount represents 5 or 10 percent of net income from last year.  So the number is that may not be collectible. In the past few weeks, I have become aware that the rising interest rates are creating more problems for customers in servicing debt.  What President Hoenig has observed in Colorado in interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages is just the beginning.  The Greenbook showed how much the subprime sector is going up; and we know, because ARMs are a big chunk of those mortgages, that it is starting to be felt.  As we go forward and more of these ARMs, especially those that have three-year lock-in periods, start to reprice, we will be seeing more of it. Now, the mortgage industry, ever creative and ever worrying about the ability of homeowners to pay amid rising rates, has now decided to create negative-amortization, fixed-rate mortgages.  What these mortgages do is say, “Just borrow for your house.  You have a monthly payment, no amortization of principal, and you do not even have to pay the full fixed rate.  We will just continue to add to your principal, and you pay what you can afford every month versus what you really owe us on the fixed rate every month.”  This process just continues, and one thing that bothers me for the long run is the extent to which housing could slow this year and slow the economy.  I just wonder about the consumer’s ability to absorb shocks.  The buildup of home equity and the ability to borrow against it have helped individual homeowners when they have had layoffs, medical problems, divorces—all the things in life that create month-to-month problems for cash flow.  With the growth of negative amortization, home equity is not being built up anymore.  Negative amortization clearly helps consumer spending because consumers, in effect, have a smaller amount of their take-home pay that has to go to the mortgage payment every month, and so it is available to be spent elsewhere.  It is probably a more pernicious type of home equity withdrawal because you don’t take an action to withdraw it.  Now it is planned that you will have negative amortization.  It clearly changes the way we look at the role of savings as a precautionary balance to get the vis-à-vis default rates both for the banking sector and for the household sector. So the growing ingenuity in the mortgage sector is making me more nervous as we go forward in this cycle, rather than comforted that we have learned a lesson.  Some of the models the banks are using clearly were built in times of falling interest rates and rising housing prices.  It is not clear what may happen when either of those trends turns around. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I hesitate to joke here at my second FOMC.  I made a joke at my first that the inaugural meeting requires the new Governors to sing, and my colleague took me up on that.  [Laughter]  So I will not offer a joke about dancing this time.  [Laughter]  In the interest of time.  [Laughter] Going to the central tendency in terms of where the economy is, I suppose I consider myself much more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast about the state of the economy.  I think some of the shocks to the economy, energy prices being the latest, speak in some ways to the durability, the flexibility, and the resilience of this economy which, on the one hand, I shake my head about but, on the other hand, I think we have to believe to some degree. I will not go into too many of the facts, which have already been described, but consumption was up 5½ percent in the first quarter.  Business capital expenditures were up about 16½ percent on an annualized basis, with strong durable goods orders.  And the increase in tax receipts that Governor Olson spoke about is a very good leading indicator, even though some of the details behind that increase are hard to know. President Poole referenced the growth in corporate profits.  Let me add a couple of notes on that.  What we are really seeing in the equity capital markets is, by and large, profitability-driven growth in the S&P and in the Dow as opposed to some sort of P/E multiple expansion.  It does give some of us more optimism as to what some of the income-statement benefits might be to consumers. As we think about what might be the elephants in the markets, certainly the housing market is one from FOMC meetings that preceded my time here.  The new elephants in the market in terms of tone and tenor are inflation and inflation expectations.  I would like to talk about them more in just a moment. When we look at the data since our last meeting, though there is a lot of noise, on balance I share the view that they tend to be more positive than expectations.  Average nonfarm payroll growth in the past six months was almost 200,000, including the April figure, and the idea of less-robust labor markets appears belied by the solid gains that we have seen in hours worked, the acceleration in wages, and the low unemployment rate, which is still at 4.7 percent.  So our thinking about a possible slowdown in the second half of the year has to at least be balanced or perhaps partly counterbalanced by what could be the first meaningful gains in take-home pay for nonsupervisory workers.  Understanding those income-statement benefits to real consumers is probably a more certain exercise at this point than trying to figure out the effect on the consumer of the housing markets, which Governor Bies spoke about. On the business front, I am at least as optimistic as I was six weeks ago about the state of business investment.  CEOs, when they have seen the appreciation of share prices in the last quarter, even as they have seen prices appreciate for many of their competitors, remain more robust, more excited, and, I think, more eager to spend money. We have seen an increase in the backlog in debt underwriting by most of the big bulge-bracket firms, and so though some of that money is, no doubt, being spent on stock repurchases, some debt is being raised in expectation of merger and acquisition activity.  At least part of it is based on a view that, as there is more uncertainty priced in the markets for the second half, companies are getting their ducks in a row to obtain some extra liquidity. you, about the synchronized global growth that we are talking about.  My biggest concern, particularly in dialogue of politicians here in Washington between now and the November elections.  The position discussions about free trade that we have heard on both sides of the aisle over the past several years are, I think, going to diminish very significantly.  There could also be many more discussions in highly contested congressional election districts about the need to isolate the U.S. markets, to cut ourselves off from a lot of foreign opportunities.  To be candid, the business community probably isn’t that eager to enter this debate with a message oriented toward free trade.  So I do think that creeping protectionism may become stronger between now and November and will have consequences for our economy to integrate with foreign markets and to continue to expand.  We may have more difficulty fighting back in some of the export markets, even with some depreciation of the dollar.  The Federal Reserve has a possible role in trying to moderate some of that discussion. Finally, just a moment on inflation:  I guess the way I would characterize it from a market perspective, and I think this is consistent with Dino’s and the Vice Chairman’s comments, is that market expectations of inflation are more fragile than they were some months ago.  I would not describe myself as an alarmist about that.  However, the traders at many of the securities firms and the folks who are hitting the trading buttons are contemporaries of mine.  They are from a generation that has not experienced inflation at first hand the way that some folks around this table have.  The psychological point of that statement is that, though we may have seen some laxity in their concern about inflation over the preceding six months and even today, that laxity could turn into some irrationality if inflation expectations get above our reasonable expectations and our comfort level.  On balance, I think that the markets, particularly those commodities.  Other folks have spoken more eloquently than I about what is happening in the TIPS markets and some of the dangerous signs in the surveys, so I will only offer two final notes. First, on the energy market side and on the commodity side, it is harder and harder to describe the run-up in prices as solely or even predominantly demand driven.  When I think about the new retail products that are now finding their way to typical broker–dealer relationships at retail-oriented chains, I see a massive surge of inflows into new silver-oriented mutual funds and copper-oriented exchange-traded funds.  A lot of that speculative money is coming very late into these markets, and that situation should suggest to us that some folks, rightly or wrongly, are assigning some sort of inflation hedge to that product, with retail investors, as usual, being the last to get in on it. Finally, on the energy front, I have been thinking about the difference between where we are now and where we might be several months from now.  I was encouraged by the same-store sales numbers that we saw in April, even in March and April together.  Those numbers are very encouraging, but as we get into the summer driving season, the energy prices may be seen as persistent.  The market may take a view that the higher prices are more permanent than most consumers believe now, and I think that’s probably an extra reason for our caution on the inflation front.  So on balance, Mr. Chairman, I am quite optimistic about the strength of the economy but at least as leery about the expectations for inflation going forward. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It worries me that we are in the hands of some exuberant 30-year-olds.  [Laughter] MR. OLSON.  He had to rub it in.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  You will hear me singing a familiar song from last time, although not exactly the same song, and unfortunately I did forget my tap shoes.  The about inflation expectations moving out of line. Consumption growth has been moderating a bit, but exactly as Governor Olson said, with the continuation of some of the changes in the tax laws, real disposable income will still have a boost.  We have seen very strong global demand, particularly on the consumption side in many countries that have been lagging in consumption.  In addition, we are also seeing strong investment demand, both domestically and internationally, and I think that is something that we have to take into account going forward. As for the key risks going forward, one, of course, is the housing market.  There has been a lot of discussion of that, and I do not think I have very much more to add.  We have to see what the lagged effects of interest rate changes are there, but that is something to be determined. Some puzzles that have persisted since last time concern the lack of pass-through of a number of things.  Of the heightened energy and commodity prices to core inflation, we have seen some uptick.  But I share Governor Kohn’s analysis, or his conclusions from the analysis, that there are some signs but that one should not be overly wary because we have had a bit of downtick, then a bit of uptick.  When we are talking about monthly movements of 0.1 percent, a simple rounding error can make things seem suddenly much higher or much lower.  It could be a 50 percent difference from what we expect when we really are just seeing a rounding error, although we do have to be very aware of this. Obviously, we have not seen pass-through of higher productivity gains to compensation.  This situation puzzles me quite a bit because, historically, by now we would be seeing more robustness of compensation, not just real disposable income, but compensation.  We have not seen that.  Productivity apparently continues to move fairly strongly.  Looking forward, I am concerned about this area even though the current data seem to suggest that the costs of labor are perfectly reasonable.  Rather than looking just at coming up in the future.   Even if there are higher costs in the labor market, are they going to be pushed through to final demand prices?  We have had a good discussion of the evidence on what has happened in the past.  Will you necessarily see the margins staying up or moving down, and will that cause the changes in underlying cost to be passed forward?  Potentially it won’t, and potentially there could be large movements.  But, again, we are in somewhat uncharted territory.  We do not have a lot of evidence here. Another set of puzzles concerns the yield curve term premiums, and we, of course, have already had a lot of discussion about those and about the slight uptick in both the survey-based and market-based measures of inflation expectations.  Obviously, that is something that we need to be very, very concerned about because the last thing that we want is to allow our actions in any way to be interpreted as a lack of concern about inflation, which could lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.  That said, I certainly do not see such unanchoring in the markets.  Also, the yield curve, although it has certainly moved up from being flat or even slightly negative, is still showing a difference between the two-year and the ten-year of only 15-20 basis points, which is not very large.  And the much flatter yield curves are a worldwide phenomenon, driven by factors not just within the United States and not just about U.S. expectations.   I also very much agree with President Stern that we should not put too much emphasis on high-frequency numbers.  We have to think about the recent numbers in a more systematic way.  What are we likely to see going forward?  What are the risks going forward, given some theory, given some historical experience? Coming back to the theme that I sang about last time—about Fed credibility not being the impossible dream, but a reality—I think we do have that reality, and it is certainly something we do not want to give up.  Just to tweak President Geithner a bit, I hope his comments should not be interpreted as doing is introducing uncertainty.  Certainly we do not want to be producing moral hazard and having inappropriately low uncertainty when real risk factors may be out there.  We certainly want to be very wary of that; we do not want to contribute to that.  But as Tim said, and I very much agree, we are in a very uncertain time, and to suggest that we are uncertain about where the economy is going is valuable.  But to suggest that the market participants are not focusing enough on uncertainty, that there should be more uncertainty, and that we should do something about it is perhaps not the way to go.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, and thank you all for your very concise comments.  [Laughter]  We will take a fifteen-minute coffee break. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  At this point I would normally try to summarize the remarks around the table.  But since you have all just heard them and since my own views are not terribly different from many who have spoken, I think in the interest of time I will just go ahead and talk briefly on my own behalf about what I see the economy doing, and then we will turn to the policy go-round. First of all, with respect to growth, I think we are following the path laid out by the Greenbook toward greater moderation in the second half.  The main difference is that, since our last meeting, the uncertainty around that prospective path has increased.  Obviously, the key to this moderation is the housing market, and fundamental analysis would suggest that the combination of high prices and rising interest rates would make affordability a problem and would bring housing starts and housing prices down.  So far we are seeing, at worst, an orderly decline in the housing market; but there is still, I think, a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly.  As I noted last time, some rather to ensure that the correction does not overly influence growth in the rest of the economy.   I would also note that there are going to be some offsets to the decline in residential investment.  We’ve noted increases in nonresidential construction, which is about half the size, as a share of GDP, of residential construction and, in terms of contribution to GDP, could make up something like a half of the direct impact of a decline in residential spending.  We also have gotten a sense that capital spending is relatively strong, and world growth is also strong, which may enhance our exports.  So there are some countervailing factors to help cushion the presumed decline in the housing market. But as we talk about the housing market, which is 6 percent of GDP, or nonresidential construction, which is 2.7 percent of GDP, we have to pay very close attention to consumption, which is 70 percent of GDP and which really is the center of the forecast for the rest of the year.  The soft landing scenario viewed in the Greenbook requires that consumption grow the rest of the year at something around 3.4 percent, which is roughly what it has been doing in the last year or so on average.  I think that is broadly plausible.  There are factors on both sides of it.  Supporting consumption, obviously, are some increases in compensation likely coming forward both in terms of hourly wages and in terms of hours worked, job availability, and to some extent maybe increases in stock prices.  On the negative side, many people have pointed out the effect of rising interest rates and softening in housing prices.  Energy is actually a bit of a mixed bag.  Energy prices are obviously a negative for consumption in level terms, but we have had a big drag on consumption for the past two years from increasing energy prices, and so if energy prices do stabilize, the drag will actually be less in 2006 than in previous years.  So, again, I do think that the slowdown that has been forecast by the Greenbook is plausible, but like a number of people around the table, I would note that so far it is largely a prospective slowdown and that the data have only begun to support that development. been remarkably stable, and I do not think it is going to rise very much; but to the extent that there are risks, they are very largely to the upside.  And I also have some concerns about the possible emergence of some inflation psychology, which is a very negative thing for our policymaking.  The factors that support higher inflation are well known.  First, energy and commodity prices.  I would point out that, rather than being transitory, they have now undergone a long, sustained increase, which evidently must at some point get into the cost structure of firms.  Second, the weakening dollar over the past month or so may be sufficient to add some pressure.  Third, the effect of compensation, I understand, is a little ambiguous.  There are some factors working in the other direction, including markups and productivity, but clearly the sense around the table is that compensation is beginning to move up somewhat, and the risks there I think are also to the upside.  Finally, it is worth noting that, at a technical level, some of the components of the inflation indexes are moving upward—in particular, owners’ equivalent rent.  It economically makes sense that, if house prices have risen so much, rents will begin to rise.  Since that is a very large share of both the CPI and the PCE core measures, that is going to be an upside risk for us. Now, again, I do not want to overstate the problem.  I think that core inflation will remain contained, to use our language, but I am concerned about those risks.  Clearly, the markets have seen a strengthening of the economy and increased inflation risk.  Despite all of our communication and language, it is summarized by an increase of about 25 basis points in where they think the federal funds rate is going to end up later this year.  We have seen and already discussed the increase in inflation compensation and in other measures of inflation expectations.  Much of our confidence that the pass-through from energy, from the dollar, and from labor costs to final goods inflation will be low is predicated on the view that inflation expectations are low and well contained.  When that premise begins to break down, then all the other elements of the analysis also begin to come under pressure. stability, we are at the upper level of what might plausibly be called the region of price stability, and further increases will be difficult and potentially costly to reverse.  So looking forward to the policy discussion, I think we are going to have to take into account the emerging inflation risk.  At the same time, there is an awful lot of uncertainty about what is going on in the economy.  It is going to be a difficult balancing act to try to maintain as much flexibility as possible so that policy can respond to new data as they arrive.  At this point I would like to turn over the floor to Vincent, who will talk about the policy options. MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, the data came in stronger than the tone of the Committee’s deliberations in March would have led any listener to suspect.  As a result, Committee communications that reflected that discussion—including the minutes, speeches by some of you, and the Chairman’s testimony—tended to pull down the expectations of future policy action, plotted in the top panel of your first exhibit, even as data releases tended to push them up.  On net, the data won, and the path of policy expectations, the middle left panel, rotated up 25 to 35 basis points.  The term structure of nominal Treasury yields also rotated up, implying increases in nominal forward rates, the blue bars in the middle right panel, of 25 to 55 basis points.  These gains outstripped the rise in real forward rates, the green bars, resulting in significant increases in inflation compensation, the difference in the height of the bars.    Inflation compensation over the next five to ten years is plotted in the bottom panel.  How you interpret these movements is likely a critical element in your policy choice today.  On the one hand, the recent rise in inflation compensation, the shaded yellow area, has not moved it noticeably above its range of variation in the past two years.  Indeed, at 2¾ percent, forward inflation compensation is lower than at times when the Committee described inflation or inflation expectations in previous policy statements as “contained” or “well contained,” the blue shaded areas.  If you think that is still the case, then you also probably believe that you have scope to be patient in policy setting. On the other hand, if you focus on the 20 basis point rise over the intermeeting period, you might conclude that there’s been a partial outbreak of inflation jitters—not a pandemic, mind you, but the first instance of trader-to-trader transmission.  [Laughter]  The anti-virus typically prescribed is a vigorous assertion of your willingness to tighten policy.   Other evidence of possible inflation concerns is the subject covered at the top of your next exhibit.  From left to right, survey measures of household inflation expectations have moved up for both near-term and longer-term horizons, and the value of the dollar has fallen sharply on foreign exchange markets.  It might be that financial market participants place some weight on domestic spending retaining considerable momentum, putting pressures on resources.  One such scenario was played out in the Greenbook and is summarized in the 2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). not moderate much—perhaps because a slowing in house-price appreciation does not materialize and firms begin to dip into their ample cash coffers to fund investment.  Inflation differs little from the baseline, but that is, in part, because policy responds, raising the nominal funds rate to 6¼ percent—as in the dashed line at the right.  This provides an opportunity to repeat a point made at Monday’s briefing.  Such an action would be inconsistent with current market expectations in that it would place the rate at the top of the 90 percent confidence band implied by options prices (the blue span).  But our understanding of the economy—as encapsulated in stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model—is sufficiently imprecise (the green range) that such an outcome shouldn’t be all that surprising.   Speaking of surprises, a major objection to tightening 50 basis points at this meeting to show your anti-inflation resolve, as in alternative C of the Bluebook, is that it would catch surprise of the modern era of FOMC announcements, at least as measured from futures  In contrast, the 25 basis point action discussed in exhibit 3 is exactly what the market is looking for.  Moreover, the staff projects that the economy will hit what you might consider to be a sweet spot, with the unemployment rate (the top left panel) zeroing in on its natural rate and core PCE inflation (the top right) receding to 2 percent.  That forecast is predicated on firming action today and none thereafter.   Alternative B in the Bluebook was structured to accompany such an action with the message that there is some chance that you might be done today, but you might not.  As can be seen in the middle left panel, energy prices have moved up sharply, which poses the classic tension of dragging down spending while imparting some lift to inflation.  In that regard, the relationship between changes in energy prices and core inflation—as at the middle right—has been tenuous at best over the past twenty years, suggesting you might prefer to focus more on the consequences of the oil shock on aggregate demand than inflation.  If so, you might view that source of additional restraint as a substitute for further monetary policy firming.  A ¼ point hike today will bring the real federal funds rate, the solid line in the bottom panel, toward the high end of the range of estimates of its equilibrium—another reason you might view yourself as done, or at least close to done.  Indeed, if you give credence to the simulations presented in the Bluebook you might view yourself as already done, which is why we included alternative A, the subject of exhibit 4.  If you have an inflation goal of 2 percent and agree with the staff assessment that the equilibrium real rate is around 2¾ percent, then the current nominal funds rate of 4¾ percent probably has a lot of appeal.  When we ran simulations of the version of the FRB/US model in which market participants are forward looking, holding the funds rate at 4¾, as in the top left panel, instead of tightening some and backing off a bit later, does not matter much for the paths of the unemployment rate and inflation (the bottom panels).  Thus, from the perspective offered by the staff model, you can go home now and not come back until the next decade, which by the way will make the work of Governor Kohn’s subcommittee easier.  [Laughter]   wording relative to the March statement and those in blue represent changes relative to what you saw in the Bluebook.  Some concern was expressed that alternative B did not convey sufficient concern about inflation risks, so we’ve tightened it up somewhat.  As can be seen, this alternative, first, stresses that current economic growth is quite strong (row 2); second, in row 3 it now simply repeats the March language verbatim; and third, it drops the word “modest” in referring to the outlook for policy firming.  One last one-word change did not get onto the table.  In the second sentence of row 2, we’re proposing to go back to the March language and refer to a growth as “likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace” instead of “toward a more sustainable pace.”  That concludes my prepared remarks.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Vincent.  Are there any questions for Vincent?  If not, I hope we can have a go-round and have people’s views on the policy.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  As I said before, I think we are essentially okay on the real side, but my concerns have risen about inflation.  I recognize the potential for slowdown later this year, but my sense is that our inflation problem is much more of an immediate issue for us.  I think we have to take seriously the possibility that inflation expectations might deteriorate further even though, as Vince said, they are within the band that we have characterized as contained.  My sense is that any statement today that moves the line today, and I think we should strive to avoid that. Second, and here I will echo something I said and something the Vice Chair said, I am very unhappy with the way in which markets have reacted over the past several weeks.  As I said earlier, markets my view, if they had marked up the policy path more and the inflation path less.  I just do not see the utility of the market’s believing in a reaction function for us that has oil price shocks pushing core inflation materially higher when they occur. Our statement today is an important opportunity to influence the public’s understanding of our reaction function, and that is the lens I am using to think about policy today.  It is fine to say that policy is going to be data dependent, but it is important how the public believes our policy is going to depend on the be imminent, and so increasing the statement’s emphasis on data dependence is likely to increase the probability they assign to a pause and thus bring down the yield curve.  As I said, I think that would be a mistake.  We need to strengthen the public sense of how strongly we intend to respond to increases in core inflation.  So this has to do with the slope of the reaction function.  Ultimately the data dependence that the proposed in my memo on Friday that we modify row 4 in alternative B to place more emphasis on inflation risks.  The way it is worded in the version that Vince just circulated does that very well—in fact, better than I did.  But in any event, whatever we do, we should strive to make sure our statement does not bring down the expected policy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have some notes.  I do not usually write them out, but I have them written out today.   First, let me say that I agree with the comment that Governor Warsh made awhile back that the economy is strong and has excellent growth prospects.  The economy is not fragile, and our job, of course, is to keep it that way.  Our interest rate policy should depend on the state of the real economy and not just on the inflation threat.  In the model with contained actual and expected inflation, the real rate of interest would fluctuate with the state of the economy.  Given the worldwide integration of capital markets, what is relevant is the state not just of the U.S. economy but also of the world economy.  The fed funds rate target should depend on the GDP gap even though the predictive value of the gap for inflation is low.  This is a message that markets ought to hear because monetary policy must be responsive both to the state of the real economy and to inflation risks. we will overstay or overshoot on the tight side, we should note that the increases in the federal funds rate through late last year were predicted in the market at the outset of the rate increases in mid-2004.  Roughly speaking, the economy should already have reacted to the first 300 basis points of fed funds rate increases.  The lag argument applies to rate increases beyond the 4 percent fed funds rate.  Inflation expectations have risen roughly 20 basis points since our March meeting.  Raising the funds rate target 25 basis points today barely keeps up with inflation expectations. Many of us have commented that we are between the Scylla of unemployment and the Charybdis of inflation.  Now, I went back and actually looked up a bit about that story, and quite frankly, it was because I did not know how to spell Charybdis.  [Laughter]  And then I found that this story, written over 2,000 years ago, was actually an example of risk management.  Some of you who are better classical scholars than I will remember that in Homer’s Odyssey, Odysseus is given advice by Circe to sail closer to Scylla for Charybdis could drown his whole ship.  Odysseus then successfully navigates the ship past Scylla and Charybdis, but Scylla manages to catch six of his men, devouring them alive. Well, Charybdis is our inflation risk.  We would like to navigate down the center of these hazardous waters, but in conducting monetary policy, we are in a pre-GPS world.  Visibility is limited, and as I look at the data and talk with business contacts, I think I hear breakers, if you will, in the direction of Charybdis, which is our inflation risk.  But as every sailor knows, the fog does funny things to sound.  I may be wrong, but I think I hear inflation breakers in the distance. I have concern both about ending rate increases too soon and about overshooting on the high side.  These two risks need to be balanced in light of the relative cost of increasing rates too much or too little.  In my view, it is better to take the risk of raising the funds target too much than of stopping too soon.  If we stop too soon and inflation rises further, the costs of bringing inflation back down are likely to be too painfully over the years, Charybdis is not just inflation, but rather inflation now plus higher unemployment later.  Charybdis, therefore, has her own Scylla just behind her as demonstrated very nicely in alternative simulation number five. Even if inflation does not rise but we conclude that a strong economy requires further restraint, view the FOMC as a source of whipsawing, which would be the case if we pause and then resume rate increases relatively quickly.  When we pause, we should be reasonably confident that we can expect, although not commit, to pause for several meetings.  Under current circumstances, we would confuse the Conversely, pausing later after further rate increases or backing rates down a bit after a pause should encourage fairly prompt resumption of expansion and minimize market disruption.  If we take monetary restraint too far, the Scylla of unemployment risk may claim a few victims, but I would rather take that risk than the risk of getting any closer to Charybdis. If we raise the funds target 50 basis points, the message to markets should be that the FOMC will now make policy decisions one meeting at a time without commitment as to decisions at future meetings.  The message ought not to be that the funds rate is likely to be unchanged.  No guidance is not the same as “no change” guidance.  If we cannot get this message across in the statement, we certainly should be able to do so in the minutes.  Markets should not interpret our policy decision at this meeting as a precursor to a pause. If we raise the funds rate target 25 basis points, we will probably have to maintain forward guidance to avoid sending misleading signals.  We could end forward guidance by indicating in the minutes that we do not intend to use similar language in June but that dropping the forward guidance is not necessarily a information for the outlook. I am well aware that 50 basis points would be a large shock to the market, and to be very honest with myself about what that might mean, I have said to myself that the Dow might fall as much as 150 or 200 points and the long bond yields might rise 10 to 15 basis points.  I am willing to impose this shock to get ahead of the markets.  I believe it would be better to act decisively now rather than later in response to accumulating bad news. I want to talk just a moment also about the minutes of this meeting.  These minutes will appear shortly after the May 25 release of the preliminary first-quarter GDP number, which the staff now puts at 5.3.  So the upward revision there is significant.  I think that the next unemployment report comes out on important.  One, the minutes need to be true to the transcript, which will be released a little less than six years from now.  It is extremely important for the long-run credibility of the institution that there not be any disconnect between the minutes and the transcript.  I believe that the minutes should report that the Committee discussed alternative C.   Two, we have an opportunity in the minutes to do several things that I think are important.  First, we can use them to show the Committee’s concern with inflation and inflation expectations.  We have had extensive discussion beginning with the staff presentation about those issues.  I think that the market is actually going to take that concern as something of a surprise and a shock because it has viewed our stance as being not very concerned about inflation.  If we reflect in the minutes the discussion around the table, I think the market will take that as some genuinely new information.  Second, we ought to use the minutes as an opportunity to get out from under the forward guidance and to explain that the guidance is not intended to provide any signal about what our action is likely to be.  I would not take the guidance out of the use the minutes to say that, when the Committee wants to make such an announcement that a pause is likely, we will do so directly with plain language—we are not going to do it indirectly.  I think we ought to be able to make that clear in the minutes.  Third, we should also say in the minutes that policy decisions will be based on the implication of new information for the economic outlook that we receive between meetings.  So those are things I think we could get across in the minutes with the space to do so.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig.    MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to share, as I did the last time, a little different perspective on this.  I continue to agree with the Greenbook and others’ projections that the economy should slow as we move through the rest of this year and next year.  I think that’s an important factor to consider because the policy actions we take today are geared toward those periods as well. I don’t want to give the impression that I’m not concerned about inflation, because I am.  Part of my concern is not that we will end too soon but that we will be too quick to reverse our position.  Let me explain.  What we have now is that current GDP growth and some of the inflationary events are the effect of past substantial accommodative policy.  Now our instincts are to keep increasing the rates until we actually see the slowing.  Thus, we tend to overshoot in terms of tightness.  That sounds familiar to me.  I think I’ve seen this movie, and that’s part of my concern. As I said, I am concerned about inflation.  In fact, I wish we had gotten where we are today a little sooner, but we didn’t.  Our challenge is to hold firm now and to hold firm when the economy begins to slow, and our instincts will be to ease, especially as the speculative excesses begin to wash out of the economy and we have a lot of people saying that it’s absolutely imperative that we ease to offset that speculative washout. larger context ahead of us.  What I’m trying to say is that I judge we are about where we ought to be.  We should allow the market to work the rest of the yield curve and the economy, so that we bring the imbalances that are in play now back into balance and, when that happens, we hold our discipline and not let our instincts to ease and offset that discipline very quickly take over.  That’s really the future challenge of monetary policy as we work through the rest of this year and into the next.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Well, I think Bill Poole has summarized a lot of what I would have said.  I forecasted that in the memo that was sent around.  I would advocate tightening 50 basis points.  I would dispute only one comment of President Poole’s.  Getting ahead of the markets is less important than getting ahead of the economy.  I do take note of your FOMC surprise chart.  The question really is, If we undertake an action, will it lead to a market reaction that might affect the economy negatively?  It’s not so much that we have a market surprise.  We’re going to have market surprises at any time, and I can walk you through, after thirty years of operating a hedge fund, a four-year cycle of market surprises.  A the trip wire would be the housing market.  We’ve discussed that to a great degree, although you, Mr. Chairman, I think gave us some good data on the offset. I think it’s important for us to get ahead of what I view—not just because of the anecdotal evidence we have but also because of the work done by our staff—as a significant expansion in capital expenditures with growth shifting to very strong business investment, excess liquidity that is going to fuel that investment, and as we all discussed, significant indications that inflation is stronger than we would like to see it.  We see that analytically, as I said earlier, with the way we calculate inflation in Dallas, but also from the anecdotal evidence. are some who would like to provide what I call a full frontal view of what we look like and what we discussed.  But as I like to say, Mr. Chairman, in romancing the market sometimes a little modesty might be more effective in achieving the ultimate goal.  I think we’ve achieved that to an extent.  I do not like the language that we see growth as likely to moderate because I don’t have confidence in that statement and I’m not sure it’s necessary.  I’d prefer the wording that President Poole sent around in terms of its brevity.  However, in the interest of perhaps more exposure, or a more-revealing presentation, I would like to add one word, which is the word “global” before “resource utilization.”  [Laughter]  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the last couple of meetings I have had concerns that I think others are sharing, or did share, that we not go too far in this round of tightening, given what I thought were perhaps transitory price pressures, some extra capacity in labor markets, and financial particular housing. Certainly there continue to be these downside risks.  The housing falloff that we’re beginning to see signs of could hit not just residential construction but also consumption harder than we expect, and rising energy costs could exact a greater tax on spending.  But as I noted, we have yet to see much of that projected slowing in the incoming data.  It’s still a forecast.  Others have focused on that as well. The more important thing that has happened, and it has certainly changed my mind with regard to the balance of risk, is the change in the inflation environment.  Market contacts tell me that they perceive the Fed as being behind the curve on inflation.  Now, normally I wouldn’t take market chatter concerned, as we should be, about our continuing credibility.   At this point, as I said earlier, I am more uncertain than I have been about where policy should be and how fast it should get there, and that uncertainty automatically takes me to alternative B.  I think 25 basis points, not 50, is the right move today even though over the course of the next several meetings we may well move for 50 or beyond that.  I just think that 50 basis points would come as a shock to terms of my own perspective of where we need to be right now.  When you are uncertain, moving slowly is usually the wiser policy.  So that’s my policy perspective—25 basis points. I was going to fool around with alternative B, and I have a whole bunch of language in here to fool around with alternative B, but it gets me to exactly the same place as this new language.  [Laughter]  So I’m really happy that we have taken out the references to inflation being contained—I think it was in row 3—and modest firming in row 4.  Not that things might not work out that way, it’s just that I’m not as certain that I want to say that directly and give the impression, which would have been reinforced by that language, that we’re more likely than not to stop at the next meeting.  I agree with others who have said that, if possible, we should aim for making things a little—I hesitate to use this word—more uncertain about what we’re going to do at the next meeting rather than give the certainty of a pause. I have a question, however.  The second part of the sentence in row 4 and the sentence in row 5 seem to me to say about the same stuff.  Do we need them both?  I must be missing something subtle here because to me they just seem to overlap a lot and make us double data dependent. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s the belt-and-suspenders approach.  [Laughter]  However, when we get to the final discussion, I’ll ask for a straw vote on whether to drop row 5. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you.  That’s it. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I stated earlier, I basically agree with the staff’s current baseline projection that, with the rate action today, we have a monetary policy that supports the return of GDP growth to somewhere near its long-term potential, along with both core and headline inflation beginning to turn back down as the year proceeds. I stated at our last meeting that I was willing to see the fed funds rate move above my best estimate of where neutral is to a level that might be somewhat restrictive as insurance against some of the adverse inflation effects of energy-price shocks that have hit the economy for more than two years now.  I noted with interest that a member of the Board staff reported on Monday at the Board briefing that the staff thinks that energy shocks will add ¾ percent to core PCE inflation this year.  Estimates such as this one give me some comfort in deciding to reach beyond my estimate of neutral, but there are limits as to how far I’m willing to reach. We all know that there is a historical relationship between energy-price shocks and weakness on the real side of the economy.  I also know, Mr. Chairman, that some economists, for whom I have a great deal of respect, have suggested that the weakness was partly associated with monetary policy action taken in response to those shocks.  I think we have reached a point where further policy actions to head off potential price pressures may come at the expense of tipping the scales in the direction of increasingly greater risk to economic activity.   I admit that I’m not happy with the degree and speed of the decline in core inflation in the long-term projections included in the Bluebook.  It has been frustrating for me to watch the headline inflation numbers keep moving up as a result of energy shocks and to see our timetable for moving core inflation lower get pushed further and further into the future.  But if the Board staff’s estimate of the effects of improvement in core inflation once the energy shocks end, other things being equal of course. One fundamental element of the outlook that might not be equal is the dragging of the inflation expectations anchor.  I know that, as prudent central bankers, we have to be constantly alert to the possibility that inflation expectations will take off.  Our worst fear, most certainly, is that they will creep up covertly and catch us unawares.  So I applaud the diligence of the Bluebook authors in looking for these weapons of mass destruction, but I’m not convinced that the evidence that we’ve compiled should provoke us to attack just yet. At the last meeting, I indicated that I was inclined to pause after this meeting.  That’s still my inclination.  But the last CPI report, coupled with little direct evidence that the pace of economic activity is slowing, has moved me closer to putting even odds on our appropriate choice at the June meeting.  I said in March that I would not like a statement that induced market participants to automatically expect a better than 50 percent chance for a rate hike in June.  It’s clear to me from our discussion today that some are leaning toward a rate increase in June and that they’re going to wait and see if the data will talk them out of it.  I also know that some people are thinking about a pause, and we’re going to wait and see if the data are going to talk us into it.  The most common theme I’m hearing is “wait and see,” and in my opinion the wisest course is to make the smallest possible number of changes in our statement and hope that the data will speak more convincingly over the next month and a half. So my preference is to make as few changes as possible to the statement that we made last month.  I think alternative B does that.  I like adding the language.  The second half of passage 4 reinforces the message of last month’s minutes that were widely interpreted as “wait and see.”  So that’s where I am:  I support alternative B.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. President Fisher—full frontal nudity—for our subcommittee than I would about the weapons of mass destruction and attack.  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  I never used the word “nudity” now.  [Laughter] MR. KOHN.  Full frontal.  Okay.  [Laughter] MS. MINEHAN.  Take it out of the transcript.  [Laughter] MR. KOHN.  “Let’s move on to monetary policy,” he said blushing.  [Laughter]  I think we do face an interesting and challenging situation here.  I agree, as I said before, that the inflation risks are higher than they seemed a month or two ago and appear more palpable, more immediate, than they did.  That has to be balanced against a forecast that things are in train that will end up containing those risks—maybe not driving inflation down to where some people want it but at least keeping it from rising.  But we haven’t really seen a lot of evidence that those things in train to contain the risks are there yet.  I acknowledge—President Hoenig made a very good point—that there is some risk of overshooting.  I think in a situation like this, we have to be forward looking but we also need to make really sure on the inflation front.  So I’d rather risk overshooting than undershooting at this point in the game. We do need to strongly resist any tendency for inflation to rise, and the public needs to understand that that’s where our focus is.  In my view, that requires ¼ point today and conveying a sense that we still see upside risks and are prepared to act if those upside risks to inflation materialize.  Like President Lacker, I’d like to see market rates at least at their current level.  I’d rather see us ending up with rates a little higher than they are now than otherwise.  Conveying this thought would probably leave rates intact and also leave market reactions to incoming data constructive.  If we say we’re worried about inflation and inflation comes in a little higher, markets will react very quickly.  I think the new judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks.”  That’s so close to last time that I think the markets will interpret it correctly.   At the same time, we have to be open-minded about when any further increase will be required.  I always thought a sensible path for policy here would be to go up quickly and then kind of flatten out the trajectory.  We kind of got caught in an every-time escalator and never were able to flatten out that trajectory.  But we’re in a position where we can both be concerned about inflation and put the market on notice that the trajectory of any further rise will be a little flatter.  I think that’s constructive, and B does that, so I support that language. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, I think policy is currently well positioned to maintain price stability over time, and a ¼ point increase today, which I favor, will on the margin enhance that position.  As I noted earlier this morning, I do think the uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased, and it may be that the risks are now tilted to the upside.  But on the other side of that particular observation is the well-known lag in monetary policy between our actions and their effects.  We have cumulatively moved a lot, and some of those moves have been recent, and so I don’t think all of the effects are currently evident. In the past, I have emphasized with some frequency the underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy.  As a consequence of that, I’m not really worried that we might go too far or overshoot.  I think the economy absorbs these things pretty well, but our obligation is to try to get it right.  I’m not exactly sure where right is, and so as a consequence of that I want to make sure that we have some flexibility going forward and that we continue to emphasize the data-driven nature of our decisions.  I associated with it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the 25 basis point increase, and, generally, the language of alternative B.  But I do have some specific suggestions on it that I’ll mention at the end of my comments. First, I want to say a few words about a topic that many of us have been speaking about publicly, which is our price stability goals and our comfort zones for inflation.  This talk is getting a lot of attention, and my current thinking is that the zone is 1 percent to 2 percent on core PCE.  The more we use this language of a comfort zone or—as I think, Mr. Chairman, you said in your comments—a zone of price stability, the more it frames the public’s interpretation of our inflation outlook and our policy moves.  That’s not a bad thing, in general, but I am concerned that many analysts are interpreting this comfort zone as a range of acceptable outcomes so that it doesn’t matter where we are within that zone of indifference. I don’t view it that way.  My preference is to see inflation moving toward the center of the zone, like the Bluebook alternative simulation that we talked about before.  For me, having our inflation forecasts consistently run at or above the top end of my comfort zone is a problem.  Market participants will ratchet up their views of the zone, and our credibility is then going to suffer.  I would hope that our policy actions would be aimed at having inflation heading more clearly for the interior of that range—subject, of course, to the constraints of our dual mandate. With regard to today’s decision, I certainly prefer that markets clearly understand that, if necessary, we’re ready to move to a rate above 5 percent.  I think the language in alternative B does that.  I suggest one major change to it, which I think people would consider major, and that is in number 3.  concerns me is “and inflation expectations remain contained.”  Bill Poole talked about the minutes reflecting accurately the meeting, and I don’t think that statement accurately reflects the discussion at this meeting.  A lot of concern has been expressed here about inflation expectations—different degrees of concern, but certainly the atmosphere is different from that in the last meeting in which we discussed it.  One way to deal with that is just to delete those five words and end the sentence with the word “check.”  Another would be to go back to the language we had before.  I would go either way on that, but I don’t think we should put that language in the statement. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given that I see the risk to growth as reasonably balanced and the risk to inflation as slightly more to the upside, I support raising the funds rate 25 basis points.  With resource utilization at high levels and core inflation near the top of the range I consider consistent with price stability, any positive aggregate demand shock could result in inflation higher than we would like.  So I think that we should take some action today to lean against this possibility, and I see that 25 basis points would do that.  I don’t sense right now that we’re behind the curve and that we need to do more. I think the funds rate is approaching the level that’s consistent with stable inflation and growth at potential, but I’m not sure whether today’s move will be the last or when the next move will be required.  That will depend on what the incoming data tell us about where the economy is headed and our assessment of the risk to that forecast. There has been a perception by some, and it’s been discussed around the table, that the FOMC often makes one or two moves too many.  At the last meeting, I said I would rather accept the risk of taking one or two moves too many than of coming up short.  The risk associated with this would be been raised too high.  We recently did a study to look at our past behavior, and the staff analysis shows that there have been numerous episodes in which the FOMC has paused and then continued along the policy path and even paused and reversed course.  So that gives me some comfort that we have the flexibility to take the appropriate actions based on incoming data. Turning to the language, I had about three pages worth of material, most of which I can throw away.  I think alternative B comes very close to the language that I think appropriate.  I have some sympathy with President Lacker’s and President Moskow’s comments that leaving the phrase about inflation expectations the way it was in the last meeting does not fairly represent the tenor of the discussion today.  Balancing that a little is the change in the language in row 4, which now addresses the inflation issue more head-on and thus shows the change in the tenor of the discussion a bit.  But we certainly would not want the markets to perceive a lower policy path by reading that in the language, and maybe the inflation expectations phrase might do that.  That concludes my comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me see if I can be reasonably concise.  First of all, I don’t think we have any viable alternative except the 25 basis points of tightening today, so I support that.  We’ve probably had more consensus around the table this morning than I remember in a long time about the way we want to convey the risk that is clearly on the inflation side.  The changes that have been made in the alternative B language from the first version that we saw are clearly in the right direction.  The language is much crisper and cleaner and emphasizes the point. I would associate myself most closely with President Lacker’s comments.  I want to repeat a comment that I made, though, in the pre-meeting comments, and I think it’s still applicable as we think about the way this statement evolves until the Kohn group’s work is finished.  I hope we’ll try to avoid forward-looking guidance until we have those fundamental strategic discussions that I think are going to come from Don’s work group.  I’m glad we did not go through with the idea of including an employment forecast.  We still have in row 2 what I consider to be a second-level detail on where the moderation is going to come from.  I think the list probably reflects the discussion, but until we deal with the Kohn subcommittee’s work, we ought to avoid the temptation to say more and explain more fully and give more guidance and more precision to our guidance.  I don’t think that serves us well. As I said before, I think we’re close to where we need to be.  I think that’s what the group said this morning.  We do need some flexibility.  I’m not as concerned as some that that suggests some uncertainty on our part.  We can’t take uncertainty away from the markets.  So I hope that we’ll talk about the issue that Michael Moskow raised about whether we’re being too reassuring about inflation expectations.  I’m generally comfortable with the current construct of alternative B.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I favor raising the funds rate 25 basis points, not 50 basis points, today.  The statement helps us get off the treadmill we’ve been on and enhances flexibility, but it doesn’t tie our hands into pausing in June if the data between now and then are so strong as to necessitate, in our view, a further move at that time.  I think B does leave open the door to as much additional tightening as may be needed, whereas C actually suggests that we think the tightening is over. Now, personally, I judge the additional amount of tightening needed to be modest, although I think a bit of additional restraint is probably desirable.  I think we are close to being done because I’m comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, and I also think our policy stance is roughly appropriate based core inflation gradually head down toward the center of my comfort range rather than see it stabilize in the vicinity of 2 percent, as in the Greenbook forecast.  I want to emphasize that only a bit is required, not a show of overwhelming force, because, as one example, the benchmark Taylor rule would suggest that a ½ percent reduction in the target inflation rate, say from 2 to 1½, the center of my comfort zone, calls for an additional increase of only 25 basis points in the funds rate, and various simulations using optimal policies as opposed to rules would similarly show a quite slow convergence toward the lower target rate.  We’ve seen that in past Bluebooks. I strongly favor a pause in our campaign in order to evaluate the effect of our policy actions to date, unless incoming data after this meeting contain large upside surprises.  Like President Hoenig, I do certainly understand the urge to continue raising rates at every meeting until we’re sure the economy is slowing.  I still remember very well the 1994 tightening episode, and then, as now, there was a sense of great momentum in the economy, posing significant upside risks to inflation.  In circumstances like that, the urge to continue tightening is natural.  It is instinctual.  Unfortunately, with policy lags such a strategy is a sure recipe for overshooting.  If we’re lucky enough to stop at exactly the right point this time, as I believe we actually did in ’95, we can be sure that it will feel risky at the moment we stop and wise only in retrospect.  The risks for policy, in my view, are now two-sided, and this is especially true with the substantial run-up since our last meeting in longer-term interest rates. Downside risks due to a possible policy overshooting are now balanced in my mind with the upside risk that we have not done enough, and I would consider a pause to evaluate where we stand as desirable and appropriate, unless of course there is new and surprising information. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Olson. President Yellen made and shut up, but I won’t.  [Laughter]  I recall in previous meetings that I said that increases would be harder and harder to justify, and I certainly expected that by this time we would have paused, although I do believe that a ¼ point raise is appropriate this time.  Were we to accept alternative A, having conditioned the market to think that we would raise until we are done, it seems to me that we would send a signal that we were done if we did pause at 4¾ percent.  On the other hand, the analysis that suggests that there will be a slowing of the economy has been a compelling argument made in the Greenbook, and therefore the description in sentence 2 seems to me to be accurate.  Were we to raise 50 basis points, it would have to be on the basis of an analysis that is more a gut feeling than an analytical approach.  Therefore, I think that alternative B, the ¼ point, is appropriate. We are at an inflection point.  As I have heard many of you say many times, the inflection point is the most difficult part of the cycle, when the most difficult decisions have to be made.  I think President Hoenig made that point earlier.  The wording that I think is going to attract the most attention is in part 4 when we say “the extent and timing.”  By that wording we are conveying that we are at an inflection point and that we may move away from the every-meeting 25 basis point move, or at least that is how I interpret it.  So I am in favor of alternative B as written. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support a 25 basis point increase at this meeting, and I like the changes that have been made to alternative B because I wanted to make sure that we came out of this with a statement that left our options open at the next meeting. While the recent inflation trends—recent being the last six months or, in other words, from before the hurricanes to where we are now—have give me a little more anxiety, I can visualize scenarios that will make us want to pause or stop at the next meeting.  That is why I, too, like the words “extent and timing” in timing.  I think the wording there is excellent. “Inflation expectations remain contained”:  I have no suggestions about how to change that line, but after listening to the dialogue around the table, I have to admit that it is the one line that gives me pause.  The various measures of core inflation have been running in the upper 2 percent area in the past six months, and that is above my personal comfort zone.  If other folks are looking at those measures, then that is perhaps partly why we’re getting some of these movements in long-term rates.  The wording does leave me uncomfortable.  At least “well” is gone; inflation expectations are now just “contained.”  [Laughter]  But they are contained at a level above what I would be comfortable with.  How we change the wording I do not know, but I agree that that particular phrase in the statement does create some anxiety. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  I agree with the 25 basis point move at this time.  I think we have seen some beginnings of evidence of heightened inflation risk relative to six weeks ago, and I think it is also very important, as President Yellen mentioned, that looking back historically, we do not want to get too far out ahead and then have some regrets.  But we also have to be concerned about how our actions will be interpreted by the market and to think about the longer-run expectations.  We have to convey that we do have some uncertainty about where the economy is going, and I think that is well reflected in our discussion here and in alternative B. But it is extremely important to keep our powder dry.  I really like the idea of saying that not only will we be looking at the data as we normally do in our due diligence but also we are going to be looking at things because there is uncertainty.  We do not have an ideological view that we must make sure that every last concern about inflation is stamped out, without concern about growth, or vice versa. best, we can be within 25 basis points of where we would hope things would be, but obviously, it is quite literally a moving target since the underlying economy is moving.  That said, I think it is very important to emphasize in the statement what First Vice President Stone mentioned: If you look at what we say in line 4, we do specifically mention that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks, which is not something that we had specifically singled out before and which I think helps offset the concern about the phrase “inflation expectations remain contained.” Although we have discussed that inflation expectations have moved up somewhat, I think that to say they are no longer contained is incorrect.  We have seen a bit of tick-up of actual inflation and a bit of tick-up of some, but not all, measures of inflation expectations.  As Vince mentioned, the most recent numbers coming from Blue Chip suggest that the professional forecasters are not saying that inflation expectations are moving up.  I am concerned that, if we took out that phrase, which we have had for a while, we would be suggesting that we do think things are becoming unhinged and that might be a self-fulfilling prophecy moving in exactly the wrong direction.  So I think the balance that we have now heightens our emphasis on inflation risk in number 4 but does not say that inflation expectations have moved too far beyond (and I do not think they have moved too far beyond) where they were before or that they have become unhinged.  I like the balance that is there between the two. I also like keeping in the red phrase in the second part of line 4; but a small amendment to make it perhaps a bit easier to swallow and to make it seem not repetitive with the statement in number 5 is that, rather than saying “in any event,” we simply say, “The Committee thus will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. Kroszner with respect to the reference to inflation expectations remaining contained.  In light of where the would be a very loud omission.  I think that alternative likely would not be expected or generate the kind of balanced reaction that we are trying to achieve.  The other emphasis that we have in section 4 addresses what I think is the balance of the discussion that we had today.  I also like in alternative B the reference to the current state of the economy in the first line of part 2, where we say that it has been quite strong so far this year.  This wording provides some credibility to some of the data that the markets are perhaps not as focused on as they should be.   So on balance, I do support alternative B as written and would make only a couple of points.  As we approach our last move, or potentially our last move, with respect to this tightening cycle, it does strike me that the burden of persuasion, if not the burden of proof, rests with us to change course.  I do not think that there is any evidence to this point that we ought to stop or even suggest to the market that a pause is in some way imminent.  We have all largely agreed that the risks of policy error here have increased, and that is why a lot of consistency between the alternative B language and our March FOMC language is perfectly appropriate. As the Vice Chairman referenced in the earlier round, we are trying to express to the markets our view of uncertainty so that they do not take what we say as a guarantee of future results but look at the data in real time as we look at the data rather than look directly just at us.  The balance that has been struck in section 4 does that very well.  Should we get to a pause at some point over the course of the next several meetings, it needs to be preceded by vigilance, which I do see reflected in section 4.  I would conclude only that it is better to leave interest rate expectations higher at this moment until we see some real signs of inflation falling more into that zone of comfort, which President Yellen and others referenced.  Thank you. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you.  My sense is that we probably have a bit more to do, and it would be helpful to signal that.  Of course, we cannot be sure we have more to do, and we certainly cannot be sure how much more, if anything, we have to do. We have sort of debated two views on the optimal path going forward at various times.  One option is that we move until we are confident that after the move we can leave policy expectations flat.  Another option is to say we move until just short of that and pause at a point that leaves some positive slope to the path going forward.  I guess I am a little more comfortable with the latter strategy than with the former.  Even if we knew with confidence what was clearly optimal, we really would not know at this point when that pause should come.  We always face some uncertainty about the band that defines the appropriate policy path, but I think we still want to err on being at the upper edge of that band, wherever it is.  We probably want to stop tightening before inflation peaks, given the lags with which policy operates, but we probably do not want to signal that we are going to stop when expectations at long horizons are still moving up a bit. A few final points:  I think inflation expectations require a difficult balance.  We don’t want to look as though we are spooked by the rise in inflation expectations, nor do we want to look as though we are indifferent to them.  I can see lots of ways we can strike that balance. A rhetorical preference:  We all like to use the simplifying rhetorical device of saying that we are going to be more “data dependent” going forward.  I prefer that we say that we are going to be more “outlook dependent” or “forecast dependent” so that we do not look as though we are going to be a little too volatile in responding to near-term changes in the data.  I am broadly comfortable with the language in B, and I think we should obviously move 25 basis points today. statement.  I think we are facing two goals that are difficult to achieve at the same time.  The first one is to respond to some increase in inflation risk and what might be a bit of an inflation scare in the bond markets.  In order to respond to that, we would have to signal that we are willing and able to continue to respond to inflation as it rears its ugly head.  If you like, inflation is the nail, and monetary policy is the hammer.  We do not have to strike the nail, but we have to show that we are not putting down the hammer.  We have to keep it in our hand.  [Laughter]  In that respect, I think it is important that we not signal that there is a definite pause.  I am also disturbed by the response of inflation compensation to those signals.  We need to keep the option open to respond once or even more than once if the inflation data and the economic outlook dictate that response.  I do think that the use of the further policy firming language in part 4, which repeats the March statement, will be viewed as hawkish and will probably have some upward effect on yields. Our second objective is to maximize our flexibility, given the degree of uncertainty that we now face in the economy.  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that an optimal policy can well include pauses for two reasons—perhaps more than two, but here are two.  The first is that we gather information over time; to the extent that we gather useful information and uncertainty is resolved, we can make a better starts and permits, two retail sales figures, and two industrial production figures, just to note some of the data that we will be seeing between now and the next meeting.  So I think it is useful for us to indicate that we will be responding to changes in the outlook and to leave ourselves the flexibility to respond in June according to how the outlook evolves. I am very sensitive to the issue of overshooting.  At least in principle, the correct response is that we look at the outlook, not at the current data.  To the extent that our forecasts incorporate the lagged effects of basis point increase today.  I recommend alternative B.   I have a couple of questions for the group.  I gather that most people have acceded to that statement, but let me just ask a couple of questions about the language.  The first is, Could we drop number five?  It does reemphasize the broad principle that we respond to changes in economic prospects, but it is a bit redundant given the previous statement.  So that is the first question I am going to ask you.  The second question has to do with inflation expectations.  I think it would be a big mistake to somehow indicate that we thought they were not contained.  First of all, it is not factually correct, as Vincent’s demonstration showed.  Second, it would convey a concern about the state of expectations that is greater than the one we actually have.  What we could do—and I am a little reluctant, but I am open to the suggestion—would be to say in that sentence, “Inflation expectations have risen slightly but remain contained” or something like that.   MS. MINEHAN.  Instead of saying “remain,” you could just say “are.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Or “are contained.” MS. MINEHAN.  “And inflation expectations are contained.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I would say “remain” because, remember, it is even after the change.  They were contained before, and now they remain contained, despite the increase. MS. MINEHAN.  Yes, but “remain” seems to me to say that they are at the same level as they were before, whereas “are” says they are in the container. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it just says they are still contained.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I like the change you suggest.  The important point is for the outside world to be aware that we recognize there has been a change in inflation expectations.  I mean, if we CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is there anyone who has an opposite view?   MR. KROSZNER.  I think as you said, Mr. Chairman, putting in number 4 that we are singling out one of the two objectives—addressing inflation—is going to be perceived as a hawkish move relative to what we had before.  Therefore, I do not think making the additional change is necessary because I think that has largely been conveyed.  Given the relatively small changes in inflation expectations, to even acknowledge that there are small changes—although saying so is factually correct—goes further than is necessary.  But I share your concern about wanting to make sure that we are very clear that we are concerned about inflation and inflation expectations. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  I would not change the language.  I would leave it as it is because inflation expectations are contained, and we want to make sure they stay contained.  That is what the two sentences independent of one another do.  I think it is a good balance. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  I agree with President Hoenig and Governor Kroszner. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.  Even though I said I certainly would think about it, I am satisfied from what I have heard around the table about the balance between part 4 and part 3.  The probability is of doing more harm than good with changing that, and so even modest changes in the wording are probably not worth making. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, in the subsequent sentence we have “the potential to add to inflation pressures,” and then in the first sentence in paragraph 4 we say that “further policy firming may be needed worried about inflation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you for these comments.  If it is all right with you, President Moskow, I would like to hold off on this until the evidence is a little clearer that inflation expectations have moved up.  Other comments?  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Mr. Chairman, in number 5, I always felt it was redundant when we had clearly communicated we were on this long trajectory.  But when we are near a turning point or a pausing point, it is probably more important to remind the market that things can happen that we do not expect, that it is not a precise forecast, and I find that this sentence is more useful at turns than it is when we are on a long-run trajectory.  So I just do not feel good about taking it out now when we have had it when it was really redundant. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I can see that taking out “remain contained” would signal a change in our container size that would probably confuse the markets, but I am broadly sympathetic to Michael’s point, and as inflation expectations evolve further, I am going to be more sympathetic to that.  With regard to five, taking it out strikes me as likely to cause markets to view what is read in alternative B, part 4, as the rewording of what is part 5 in the March statement, and so I do not think they are going to view it as a withdrawal of substantive indication of the extent to which we are going to be outlook dependent.  So I would be in favor of taking it out. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I am in favor of taking it out unless someone can tell me what different thing it says other than what is said in the last part of sentence 4.  Maybe I am missing something, but I think sentence or row 4, whatever we call it, says that we are going to firm, to address inflation risks, but we implied by incoming information.  How is that different from what we are saying in row 5? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The slight difference is that it refers specifically to firming whereas the last paragraph says that as a broad general principle. MS. MINEHAN.  Do we think that the last sentence gives us the ability then to reduce rates in the context? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If necessary. MS. MINEHAN.  Because there are ways you could change the language in row 4 to deal with that.  But if that is what you think, if you feel that that gives us a little more flexibility, I guess I do not have a problem with it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  I support leaving row 5 in, and I support it because the old row 5 referred to the dual objectives of price stability and sustainable growth, which came in row 4.  The new row 4 does not refer to sustainable growth at all.  This is vague, but if challenged, we could at least say that we have not forgotten about our dual objectives.  If we omit any even indirect reference to the dual objectives, it does not describe our reaction function and would not be the right thing to do. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I would append to Governor Kohn’s remark and just say that for that reason, President Minehan, it does have the benefit of adding to flexibility. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  I strongly support what Governor Kohn said. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  President Fisher. support of the attainment of our objectives” or “its objectives.”  Take out the black stuff.  It is a slight change.  That achieves what Cathy wants. MS. MINEHAN.  There are easy ways to modify row 4 to make it do the same thing. MR. FISHER.  That is what I mean. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  At this point, having heard the discussion, I would like to propose to the group that we keep line 5 where it is.  Line 4 talks specifically about this firming proposal and the possibility of a pause.  Line 5 responds to both of our objectives and re-emphasizes the fact that we do have, of course, symmetric employment/inflation objectives.  I think I have heard around the table a few times in previous contexts that any change has implications that we may or may not be able to predict very well.  Any other comments on this statement?  Yes, President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I would like to ask Vince if he would give us a judgment about how the language of alternative B is likely to affect the market’s probability of action in June. MR. REINHART.  Oh, I thought that question was directed to Dino.  [Laughter]   MR. POOLE.  I would be happy to have you both address it. MR. REINHART.  In yesterday’s quotes, the July fed funds contract was at 5.07; so that is basically a 7-out-of-25 chance that the Committee would act.  In the design of B, we thought that the probability would move it up into the 50-50 to 60-40 range.  I think it is probably a little tougher than what is in the Bluebook, so I am a little more confident it would be above 50-50.   MR. KOS.  It would raise it. MR. POOLE.  I will tell you my instinct is that the part that is in red will be viewed as actually producing a presumption that the first part will not be carried through.  As it says, “policy firming may yet be needed.”  But then the part in red, it seems to me, tempers that very, very substantially, and it is not clear my own feeling. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The test I would apply would be what the odds are as of October.  There is the possibility that there might be some shifting in timing between, say, June and August, for example. MR. POOLE.  Obviously this is something that is very hard to gather any evidence on in advance.  I am just telling you my gut feeling for what’s going to happen is that this will reduce the market’s expectation about action in June, and I would be surprised if that were just simply switched out later in the year.   MR. REINHART.  Well, President Poole, the most unsatisfying paragraphs in the Bluebook meeting after meeting are the ones that try to divine what the market reactions to alternative statements will be.  We do not have a scientific way of doing it. MR. POOLE.  The reason I raise the question is that I agree very much with Jeff that we do not want language that reduces the market expectation of another action in June, unless the data between now and then change the outlook sufficiently.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There are two parts, though.  Part is the effect today.  My guess is that it will be hawkish on net, but there is a lot of uncertainty, and so you may be right.  The other part of this is the indication of responsiveness to data.  So if the intermeeting data—and I noted how many different things we are going to be seeing—are suggestive of greater inflation pressures, I imagine that when we sit down here in June we will have a much better idea of what is expected and what we are likely to do at that point.  Dino. MR. KOS.  Again, the three words that the market would be looking for are “further policy firming.”  Those are the three that they will be looking for and that will be taken as the signal of likely previous statements have been.  So I think the probability goes up, but maybe not to 100 percent or to 80 or 90 percent.  So I think Vince is in the right ballpark in his judgment. MR. REINHART.  One last point is that the second part of the sentence in row 4 is partly already in I agree with Dino that they will be looking at the earlier words. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any other comments?  Yes. MR. MOSKOW.  I just had a question.  It is a slight, minor change, but would it make any difference if you took out the two words “emphasizes that” from number 4? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it would make a difference because it would focus the market very much on the first part of the sentence, which basically is saying that we are going to move again in between now and then. MR. MOSKOW.  So it is intentional that those two words are in there. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Any other comments? MS. DANKER.  I will be reading the directive from page 29 of the Bluebook.  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent.” And the risk assessment from the press release that’s being handed around: “The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.” Chairman Bernanke   Vice Chairman Geithner Governor Bies President Guynn Governor Kohn Governor Kroszner President Lacker Governor Olson President Pianalto Governor Warsh President Yellen          Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The Governors need to join me. [Recess] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, everyone.  There are a couple of other quick items.  First, I would like to ask Governor Kohn to give a brief report on his subcommittee on communications. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Presidents Stern and Yellen have agreed to serve with me on this subcommittee, the full-frontal subcommittee, I guess.  [Laughter]  We see our mission as helping the Committee—bringing issues to the Committee, helping frame the discussion, trying to figure out the topics and the logical order in which they should be addressed, and reaching out to Committee members.  We do not see our mission as coming up with hard and fast recommendations to the FOMC but as just helping the discussion along.  If we do see some consensus developing as we talk to you, we will certainly let you know. The Chairman has made it very clear to me that everything is on the table in terms of communication between the Committee members and the outside world.  We will think about goals and how best to meet them, how we can accomplish this.  Our objective for the coming intermeeting period is to put an agenda together, to figure out the topics that we collectively should be talking about and some order views on what should be on the table and how we should approach some of these issues. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  We have now had experience with both a two-day and a one-day meeting.  I hope that maybe in June we will be able to make some kind of decision about how to schedule meetings going forward.  I am going to ask Vincent to poll everyone during the intermeeting period about preferences as to meeting structure, scheduling, and the like.  If anyone would like to make a comment at this point about today’s meeting or this general issue, this would be the time.  I hear none.  You will be hearing from Vincent, and we will put this on the agenda for discussion next meeting. The final formal action is just to note that the next meeting will be a two-day meeting on June 28 and 29.  Thank you.  We are adjourned. END OF MEETING  ',\n",
              "       ' A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, June 28, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. and continued on Thursday, June 29, 2006 at 9:00 a.m.Ms. Minehan, Messrs.

Rasche, Rolnick, and Sellon, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, respectivelyMs. Mucciolo, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkBy unanimous vote, the Committee approved a \"Report and Plan of the Federal Open Market Committee to Improve FOIA Operations\" and approved a delegation of authority to the Chairman (or his designee) to take actions required under the Freedom of Information Act.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed substantially from its rapid first-quarter pace.  The expansion of consumer spending softened, and activity in the housing market continued to cool.  In contrast, the underlying rate of business spending remained strong and was well supported by fundamentals.  The demand for labor appeared to moderate as hiring stepped down in recent months.  Consumer price inflation remained elevated in April and May, reflecting sharp rises in energy prices and more rapid increases in core prices.Gains in nonfarm private payrolls averaged 112,000 over the three months ending in May, a pace considerably below the average of about 170,000 jobs per month for the prior three-month period.  The slowing in hiring was most pronounced in retail trade but was also evident in construction and information services.  Establishments in professional and business services, nonbusiness services, and wholesale trade continued to add jobs at roughly the same pace as earlier in the year.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April but reversed these gains in May.  The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, near its average for the year so far.Industrial production edged down in May after strong growth in April, largely reflecting the patterns of manufacturing output.  For the year to date, manufacturing production advanced at a rate significantly below its rapid fourth-quarter growth rate but only a bit below its average pace of expansion since mid-2003.  The mining sector, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, expanded solidly in April before falling back in May.  Utilities output also grew strongly in April but retreated in May as temperatures returned to normal after having been unseasonably warm in April.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing remained somewhat above its long-run average in both April and May.Real consumer spending appeared to be on track to decelerate noticeably in the current quarter after posting robust growth in the first quarter.  The slowing reflected both a marked reduction in the growth in real outlays for motor vehicles from an elevated first-quarter pace and a moderation in the advance of real expenditures for other goods in recent months.  Underlying this slowing in the expansion of consumer expenditures was a moderation in the fundamental determinants of spending.  The level of nominal wages and salaries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised down considerably, and rising consumer prices held down the gains in real disposable income.  Higher interest rates also likely restrained spending.  Nonetheless, despite recent declines in equity prices, the wealth-to-income ratio remained well above its historical average, and consumer sentiment, which dipped in May, rebounded some in early June.Residential construction activity moderated over the past few months but remained at a historically high level.  Single-family starts posted a sizable drop in May for the third consecutive month.  Although a substantial portion of May\\'s decline seemed to be a partial payback for the elevated level of starts early in the year, when weather conditions had been favorable, the underlying pace of single-family housing construction appeared to have slowed.  In the multifamily sector, starts in May were well within the typical range seen since 1995.  Sales of both new and existing single-family homes in April and May were significantly below their peaks of the summer of 2005, though new home sales continued to regain some ground after having fallen in February.  The most reliable measures of house prices indicated modest growth following the rapid increases seen last year.After a first-quarter surge, real spending on equipment and software appeared on track for a much smaller gain in the second quarter.  Incoming data for the current quarter suggested that spending on transportation equipment reversed the run-up that occurred in the first quarter.  Spending on high-tech equipment and software advanced at a slower pace in the second quarter as a flattening out of spending on communications equipment after a huge increase in the first quarter offset some pickup in business-sector demand for computers and software.  The construction of nonresidential buildings picked up noticeably so far this year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000.  Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high projected energy prices.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles stepped up in April.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales held steady for the year so far after having fallen considerably last year.  In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories.The U.S. international trade deficit widened in April, reflecting a large increase in imports coupled with a slight decline in exports.  Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods.  Exports were restrained in part by a decline in aircraft exports.  Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed.  Incoming data pointed to a possible slowing in Canada, but signs of further expansion in the euro area and of continued growth in Japan were evident, notwithstanding sharp declines in equity indexes in these countries.Headline inflation picked up in April and May, driven partly by sharp increases in the prices of petroleum-based products.  In contrast, natural gas prices continued to decline in response to excess supply, fully reversing last autumn\\'s rises.  Higher oil prices showed through to producer prices for a variety of energy-intensive intermediate goods.  Consumer food prices decelerated markedly since January, reflecting slower price increases for food away from home and declines, on balance, in the prices of fruits and vegetables.  Core price inflation rose less than headline inflation in April and May but above its pace earlier in the year.  Core prices were boosted in part by an acceleration in shelter costs, especially those imputed for owner-occupied residences.  Readings on the growth of labor costs were revised down for the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006, but recent data suggested a pickup in the second quarter.  A number of indicators of inflation expectations largely reversed increases recorded in the spring.At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.  The Committee saw growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  At that time, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation.  Ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remained contained.  Still, possible increases in resource utilization and the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee foresaw the possibility of a need for some further policy firming to address inflation risks but emphasized that the extent and timing of any such firming would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.Investors anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its May meeting to raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points, but near-term policy expectations edged up, apparently in response to the accompanying statement.  Subsequent data releases reporting higher-than-expected inflation, the release of the FOMC minutes, and speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers all led investors to push up their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate.  Yields on near-term nominal Treasury securities rose in line with policy expectations over the intermeeting period, but those on longer-dated securities moved up by smaller amounts.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased by more than those on nominal securities, and the resulting decline in inflation compensation retraced a substantial share of the rise that had occurred over the preceding intermeeting period.  Major stock price indexes fell sharply over the period.  Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened somewhat, while those on speculative-grade issues rose by more.After changing little on balance during much of May, the dollar\\'s foreign exchange value against other major currencies moved up in June and showed a modest increase, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated after comments by FOMC policymakers that were interpreted by market participants as suggesting a higher likelihood of policy tightening at the June FOMC meeting.  Prices of precious and industrial metals, which had risen sharply since early March, particularly in May, reversed those gains later in the intermeeting period.Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have decelerated in the second quarter after a robust first-quarter increase.  Business sector debt advanced more slowly in the second quarter, although the expansion of business loans remained brisk and net issuance of corporate bonds was solid.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing slowed in response to more subdued housing activity and moderating house-price appreciation.  M2 growth in the second quarter was tepid, as the growth of nominal income had apparently softened and rising opportunity cost continued to dampen demand for money.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that, after the significant deceleration of real GDP in the current quarter from the first quarter of 2006, growth would proceed through the end of 2007 at a pace a bit below the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential.  The outlook for modest growth of real GDP reflected a slowdown in the housing market, the effects of past policy tightening, and a diminished boost to consumer spending from increases in household wealth.  Core consumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in the second quarter from its average pace over the preceding several quarters but to then drop back somewhat, albeit to a level higher than previously forecasted, as energy and import prices flatten out and some slack emerges in labor and product markets.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw economic growth as having moderated in the second quarter from its robust pace in the first quarter, reflecting a cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  Most participants expected output to advance over the next year and a half at a pace close to that which the economy can sustain over time.  All participants found the elevated readings on core inflation of recent months to be of concern and, if sustained, inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability.  However, contained inflation expectations, the abatement of upward pressure from past increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the slowing in the growth of economic activity that was under way were expected to contribute to a moderation in core inflation in coming quarters.  Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2006 and 2007, conditioned on the participants\\' views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.  The forecasts of the rate of fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter expansion in real GDP for 2006 were in a range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, with a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent, and those for 2007 were in a range of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent, with a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, with a central tendency at both horizons of 4-3/4 to 5 percent.  Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the change in the average fourth-quarter core PCE price index from a year earlier, ranged from 2-1/4 to 3 percent for this year, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and the range and central tendency were 2 to 2-1/4 percent for next year.In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants observed that housing construction activity had declined notably in recent months as indicated by lower housing starts and permits; moreover, higher inventories of unsold homes, a sharp rise in cancellations of new home sales, and reports from construction companies suggested that the weakness was likely to be extended.  Several participants pointed out that the decline was broadly in line with expectations in light of the tightening in monetary policy and the rapid run-up in home prices and residential construction in recent years.  Participants also observed that the evidence to date indicated that the slowdown was orderly but were mindful of the possibility of a sharper downturn in the sector.The growth of consumer spending had dropped off significantly in the second quarter from a robust pace earlier in the year.  The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates.  A reduction in the attractiveness of home equity borrowing was mentioned as possibly contributing to the slowdown.  Some retailers, especially those catering to lower- and middle-income customers, reported weaker growth in sales.  Consumer spending was expected to advance modestly in coming quarters as the effects of more moderate gains in home prices and a gradual rebound in the household saving rate from recent historically low levels were offset by further gains in employment and growth in labor income.  A few participants noted that the surge in federal tax receipts this year and a similar advance in revenue at the state level could be a sign of vigorous gains in income, indicating that household spending may expand more rapidly than many were anticipating.Participants interpreted the incoming data on orders and shipments of durable goods, positive readings on business sentiment, and continued high levels of corporate profitability as suggesting that business investment would remain a source of strength going forward.  In a shift from the pattern observed in the past few years, some contacts suggested that businesses were now directing their capital expenditures toward expanding capacity rather than increasing efficiency, a signal of the anticipation of continued solid growth in demand.  Business expenditures on nonresidential structures also were seen to be advancing robustly in a number of markets, possibly providing some offset to reduced residential construction activity.  Several participants observed that the continued ready availability of credit would support business expenditures.  Others, however, noted that the pullback from risk-taking that had been observed in some financial markets over the preceding few months could intensify, raising the cost of funds.Participants observed that many foreign central banks had tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period in response to strengthening activity and indications of inflation pressures.  Greater uncertainty about inflation pressures and the needed policy response had perhaps contributed to a reassessment of risks by investors globally.  Despite the tighter policy, however, economic growth in the United States\\' major trading partners appeared likely to remain solid, supporting U.S. exports.  Participants also discussed the role of global capacity utilization in the inflation process.All meeting participants expressed concern about recent elevated readings on core inflation.  A key issue was the extent to which this spring\\'s increase in inflation reflected transitory or persistent influences.  Many noted that a number of factors were temporarily boosting inflation.  The pass-through of the substantial rise in energy prices could account for a considerable part of the step-up in core inflation in recent quarters.  In addition, rising rents had been boosting the cost of shelter and so contributing to the increase in core inflation.  However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.  The moderation in the economic expansion was expected to prevent pressures on resource utilization from intensifying.  In sum, with inflation expectations contained and unit labor costs held down by ongoing gains in productivity and modest advances in compensation, inflation was seen by most participants as likely to edge down.Nevertheless, several factors were cited as potentially sustaining upward pressure on inflation, and the range of participants\\' forecasts for core inflation in 2007 rose by 1/4 percentage point relative to the range of forecasts made in February.  Some participants noted that businesses in their Districts were experiencing difficulty hiring certain types of skilled workers, suggesting that increased wage pressures might emerge.  In addition, some business contacts indicated a greater ability to pass higher costs on to customers, although other businesses continued to report that their pricing power remained limited.  The relatively taut resource markets and the lagged effects of the increase in energy prices raised the possibility that inflation could continue at somewhat elevated levels for some time.  Higher levels of inflation, should they persist, could become embedded in inflation expectations.  In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.All Committee members agreed that raising the target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5-1/4 percent, at this meeting was appropriate given the recent readings on inflation and the associated deterioration in the inflation outlook.  Such an action would also help preserve the decline in inflation expectations that had occurred over the intermeeting period and which appeared to be conditioned on an outlook for a policy firming.  Characterizing the resulting stance of policy was quite difficult in the view of most members; those who did venture a judgment saw the stance as ranging from modestly restrictive to somewhat accommodative.  Many members noted that significant uncertainty accompanied the appropriate setting of policy going forward, and one indicated that the decision to raise the target federal funds rate at this meeting was a close call.In their discussion of the wording of the statement to be released after the meeting, members expressed a wide range of views.  Some members favored a shorter statement that focused on the Committee\\'s desire to see core inflation decline from its recent elevated levels, while others were inclined to provide more information about the forces that would likely influence the future path of policy.  In light of the possibility that the lessening of inflation pressures could be more limited than consistent with sustained good performance of the economy, members agreed to indicate that \"[a]lthough the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time . . . some inflation risks remain.\"  Nevertheless, with the economy slowing and some of the effects of past tightening still in the pipeline, members recognized the value of accumulating more information for determining what, if any, additional policy action would be needed following the tightening adopted at the current meeting.  To indicate that policy action at future meetings was not foreordained and would depend on the forecasts for inflation and activity in the medium term, the Committee agreed to state that \"[t]he extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"After consulting with the participants, the communications subcommittee recommended that the Committee begin its discussions of communications issues at the FOMC meeting in August and that the FOMC meetings scheduled for later this year be lengthened to allow a fuller initial discussion of some of these issues.  The Committee also discussed briefly the schedule for FOMC meetings next year and tentatively agreed to increase the number of two-day meetings to four.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Votes for this action:  Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, \\nMs. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, and Lacker,  \\nMs. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action:  None.The meeting adjourned at 11:10 a.m.Notation Vote\\nBy notation vote completed on May 30, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held on May 10, 2006.Return to topFOMC I am pleased to be here this afternoon to participate in the International Monetary Conference.\\xa0 In my remarks, I will provide a brief update of the economic outlook for the United States and discuss the implications of that outlook for monetary policy.It is reasonably clear that the U.S. economy is entering a period of transition.\\xa0 For the past three years or so, economic growth in the United States has been robust, reflecting both the ongoing re-employment of underutilized resources as well as the expansion of the economy’s underlying productive potential, as determined by factors such as productivity trends and the growth of the labor force.\\xa0 Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.\\xa0 As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nation’s underlying productive capacity.\\xa0 It bears emphasizing that productivity growth seems likely to remain strong, supported by the diffusion of new technologies, capital investment, and the creative energies of businesses and workers.\\xa0 Thus, productive capacity should continue to expand over the next few years at a rate consistent with solid growth of real output.Real gross domestic product grew rapidly in the first quarter of this year, but the anticipated moderation of economic growth seems now to be under way.\\xa0 Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of total spending, has decelerated noticeably in recent months.\\xa0 One source of this deceleration is higher energy prices, which have had an adverse impact on real household incomes and weighed on consumer attitudes.\\xa0 As had been expected, recent readings also indicate that the housing market is cooling, partly in response to increases in mortgage rates.\\xa0 To be sure, the data on home sales and construction have been somewhat erratic from month to month, reflecting weather conditions, statistical noise, and other factors.\\xa0 However, overall, housing activity has softened relative to the high levels of last summer, and the rate of house-price appreciation appears to have lessened.\\xa0 A slowing of the real estate market will likely have the effect of restraining other forms of household spending as well, as homeowners no longer experience increases in the equity value of their homes at the rapid pace seen in recent years.Gains in payroll employment in recent months have been smaller than their average of the past couple of years, and initial claims for unemployment insurance have edged up.\\xa0 These developments are consistent with the softening in the pace of overall economic activity that seems to be under way.\\xa0 That said, going forward, relatively low unemployment and rising disposable incomes may counter to some extent the factors tending to restrain household spending.Although spending by the household sector is showing signs of moderation, other sectors of the economy retain considerable momentum.\\xa0 According to the available data, business investment appears to have risen briskly, on net, so far this year.\\xa0 In particular, investment in nonresidential structures, which had been weak since 2001, seems to have picked up appreciably, raising the possibility that increased nonresidential construction may absorb some of the resources released by the slowing housing sector.\\xa0 Spending on equipment and software is also on a strong upward trend, and backlogs of orders for capital goods are still rising.\\xa0 Business investment is being supported by high rates of profitability and capacity utilization.\\xa0 Credit conditions for businesses are favorable:\\xa0 Although market participants appear to have become more attuned to risks in recent weeks, corporate bond spreads remain low, and banks are well capitalized and willing to lend.Globally, output growth appears poised to exceed 4 percent for the fourth consecutive year--a strong performance that will support the U.S. economy by continuing to stimulate our exports of goods and services.\\xa0 The buoyant global economy does present some challenges, however.\\xa0 In particular, the increased world demand for crude oil and other primary commodities, together with the limited ability of suppliers to expand capacity in the short run, has led to substantial increases in the global prices of those goods.\\xa0 Those price increases are a partial offset to the forces supporting global growth and are also a source of inflationary pressure.Longstanding concerns about global imbalances remain with us as well.\\xa0 Along with greater national saving in the United States, increased domestic demand in countries with current account surpluses and a greater flexibility of exchange rates more broadly would help to reduce those imbalances over time.\\xa0 Should U.S. economic growth moderate as expected, sustaining the global expansion will require a greater reliance by our trading partners on their own domestic spending as a source of growth.Consumer price inflation has been elevated so far this year, due in large part to increases in energy prices.\\xa0 Core inflation readings--that is, measures excluding the prices of food and energy--have also been higher in recent months.\\xa0 While monthly inflation data are volatile, core inflation measured over the past three to six months has reached a level that, if sustained, would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists, including myself, would consider consistent with price stability and the promotion of maximum long-run growth.\\xa0 For example, at annual rates, core inflation as measured by the consumer price index excluding food and energy prices was 3.2 percent over the past three months and 2.8 percent over the past six months.\\xa0 For core inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures, the corresponding three-month and six-month figures are 3.0 percent and 2.3 percent.\\xa0 These are unwelcome developments.Although the rate of pass-through from the higher prices of energy and other commodities to core consumer price inflation appears to have remained relatively low, the cumulative increases in energy and commodity prices have been large enough that they could account for some of the recent pickup in core inflation.\\xa0 Despite recent increases in spot oil prices, futures markets imply that oil prices are not expected to continue rising.\\xa0 The realization of that outcome would reduce one source of upward pressure on inflation.\\xa0 However, the volatility of these and other commodity prices is such that possible future increases in these prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.\\xa0 Subdued growth in most broad measures of nominal labor compensation and the ongoing expansion of labor productivity have held down the rise in unit labor costs, the largest component of business costs.\\xa0 Anecdotal reports suggest, however, that the labor market is tight in some industries and occupations and that employers are having difficulty attracting certain types of skilled workers.\\xa0 Finally, some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged up, on net, in recent months, as has the compensation for inflation and inflation risk implied by yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt.\\xa0 As yet, these expectations measures have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in recent years, but these developments bear watching.With the economy now evidently in a period of transition, monetary policy must be conducted with great care and with close attention to the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.\\xa0 Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.\\xa0 There is a strong consensus among the members of the Federal Open Market Committee that maintaining low and stable inflation is essential for achieving both parts of the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.\\xa0 In particular, the evidence of recent decades, both from the United States and other countries, supports the conclusion that an environment of price stability promotes maximum sustainable growth in employment and output and a more stable real economy.\\xa0 Therefore, the Committee will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained.Toward this end, and taking full account of the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, the Committee will seek a trajectory for the economy that aligns economic activity with underlying productive capacity.\\xa0 Achieving this balance will foster sustainable growth and help to forestall one potential source of inflation pressure.\\xa0 In addition, the Committee must continue to resist any tendency for increases in energy and commodity prices to become permanently embedded in core inflation.\\xa0 The best way to prevent increases in energy and commodity prices from leading to persistently higher rates of inflation is by anchoring the public’s long-term inflation expectations.\\xa0 Achieving this requires, first, a strong commitment of policymakers to maintaining price stability, which my colleagues and I share, and, second, a consistent pattern of policy responses to emerging developments as needed to accomplish that objective.Our economy has reaped ample rewards in recent years from the achievement and maintenance of price stability.\\xa0 Although challenges confront us, as they always do, I am confident that we will be able to preserve those hard-won benefits while promoting sustainable economic growth. I am pleased to be here today and thank you very much for the invitation.\\xa0 The focus of this conference is risk management, which I think is an excellent discussion topic for bankers, regardless of their institution’s size.\\xa0\\xa0 In fact, I am quite pleased to see more and more conferences devoted exclusively to risk management, analyzing its different facets and exploring ways to tailor it to specific institutions and situations.\\xa0 There is growing understanding that good risk management can be an integral part of running any type of business.Risk Management in Financial ServicesWith respect to financial services, the Federal Reserve Board, as the primary supervisor of state member banks and the consolidated supervisor of financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness of banks’ risk management in order to keep pace with changing business practices and strategies. \\xa0The Federal Reserve has long emphasized the need for appropriate and strong internal controls in the institutions we supervise, and we have taken a continuous-improvement approach to our risk-focused examinations. \\xa0For many years, enterprise risk management across an entire entity has received increased scrutiny.Of course, bankers are the ones who have led the way in continuing to improve the risk-management and risk-measurement processes at their institutions.\\xa0 To be more effective competitors and to control and manage their losses, banks have created many new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures. \\xa0By more clearly defining risk exposures, identifying the causes of their losses, and establishing controls to limit future losses, bank managers have been better able to integrate decisions about risk-taking into their strategic and tactical decision making. \\xa0Banks that integrate risk measurement into their business-line goals often find that this helps them to implement their strategic plans more effectively. \\xa0That is because strategic planning tends to focus more on alternative “most likely” scenarios.\\xa0 By including a risk management analysis in the strategy discussion, bankers can more clearly identify the inherent operational and environmental factors that can significantly affect the realization of strategic goals.\\xa0 Thus, banks can design in, at the start, the appropriate internal controls and management information systems to improve the execution of the strategy.In some cases, firms may be practicing good risk management on an exposure-by-exposure basis, but they may not be paying close enough attention to the aggregation of their exposures or concentrations that arise in the resulting portfolios of business. \\xa0Also, rapid growth can place considerable pressure on an organization\\'s management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, and asset/liability management, among other areas.\\xa0 Many of the companies that have attracted public attention in recent years due to serious breaks in controls failed to focus on process changes and critical investments in their risk management and control systems that were needed to successfully support their business plans.\\xa0 An organization must also understand how its various business components dynamically interact. \\xa0A successful enterprise-wide risk management process can help to meet many of these challenges.At the same time, it is clear that risk management practices need to be applied in a manner appropriate to the size and complexity of the organization.\\xa0 While the leading-edge risk-management practices used at the largest, most complex banks may have some applicability at smaller, less complex banks, data and cost limitations require greater use of more generalized models and the use of outsourcing to supplement the knowledge base of the institution.\\xa0 And as most of you know, running a smaller or less complex bank presents different types of challenges and requires a risk-management framework appropriately tailored to the institution.\\xa0 For example, transactions may be conducted more on a relationship basis and may be less data-intensive.\\xa0 In such a case, bank management needs to develop risk-management tools that allow it to ensure that risks are still being appropriately addressed.\\xa0 Further, smaller organizations often face a challenge of ensuring independent review of processes and decisions since officers and staff often have multiple responsibilities that can present conflicts of interest.Many of you are probably familiar with the enterprise risk management framework published over a year ago by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO.\\xa0 The COSO framework provides a useful way to look at enterprise risk management.\\xa0 Notably, the COSO framework states explicitly that, while its components will not function identically in every entity, its principles should apply to institutions of all sizes.\\xa0 Small and mid-size entities, for example, may choose to apply the framework on a less-formal and less-structured basis and scale it to their own needs--as long as quality is maintained.\\xa0 This underscores the message from bank supervisors that good risk management is expected of every institution, regardless of size or sophistication.\\xa0 Naturally, some tension will still exist between what supervisors expect and how bankers want to run their business.\\xa0 But we hope that supervisory expectations for risk management are becoming more and more aligned with the way that bankers run their businesses.I would now like to turn to two examples highlighting the importance of risk management for smaller banks:\\xa0 credit concentrations and business disruptions.Lending Concentrations As any banker worth his or her salt knows, lending concentrations must be carefully identified, monitored, and managed.\\xa0 It is one of the basics of banking to understand the consequences of placing all your eggs in one basket.\\xa0 Naturally, supervisors from time to time have concerns about growing credit risk concentrations at banks and bankers’ ability to manage them.\\xa0 A current example is commercial real estate (CRE).\\xa0 The U.S. banking agencies recently issued proposed guidance on CRE lending, and a major portion of that guidance is directed at CRE concentrations.\\xa0 The agencies have received many comment letters on the proposed guidance.\\xa0 These comments will be very helpful as we discuss what steps to take next.Before I discuss the importance of managing CRE concentrations, I want to emphasize that the proposed CRE guidance is intended to encompass “true” CRE loans.\\xa0 It is not focused on commercial loans for which a bank looks to a business’s cash flow as the source of repayment and accepts real estate collateral as a secondary source of repayment.\\xa0 That is, the proposed guidance addresses bank loans for commercial real estate projects in which repayment is dependent on third-party rental income or on the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property.\\xa0 These are “true” commercial real estate loans in that repayment depends on the condition and performance of the real estate market.I also want to mention up front that the proposed guidance is not intended to cap or restrict banks’ participation in the CRE sector but rather to remind institutions that proper risk management and appropriate capital are essential elements of a sound CRE lending strategy.\\xa0 In fact, many institutions already have both of these elements in place and may not need to adjust their practices very much.I believe we are all aware of the central role that CRE lending played in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\\xa0 One reason supervisors are proposing CRE guidance at this point is that we are seeing high and rising concentrations of CRE loans relative to capital.\\xa0 For certain groups of banks, such as those with assets of between $100 million and $1 billion, average CRE concentrations are about 300 percent of total capital.\\xa0 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the concentration level for this same bank group was about 150 percent, or half the current level.\\xa0 Therefore, banks should not be surprised by the emphasis in the proposed CRE guidance on concentrations and the importance of portfolio risk management.Historically, CRE has been a highly volatile asset class.\\xa0 In the past, problems in CRE even at well managed banks have generally come at times when the broader market encounters difficulties.\\xa0 Borrowers and bankers with properties in distress can disrupt their local real estate market by cutting rents or offering leasehold improvements and other incentives to attract or keep tenants in an effort to generate cash flow.\\xa0 This can negatively affect the local real estate market as a whole, and adversely affect even good projects. \\xa0CRE is a highly volatile asset class in that credit losses in most years are relatively low compared with many other types of bank loans.\\xa0 But in times of stress, the loss rate on CRE can jump considerably higher relative to the good years, compared with the behavior of other types of loans.\\xa0 Since CRE losses tend to be concentrated in these times of stress, bankers must focus more intently on their risk appetite for losses as their concentration grows.\\xa0 This means considering how much capital can be placed at risk if the portfolio of CRE loans hits a stress period and comparing that loss exposure to the\\xa0 relative returns in CRE lending, i.e., practicing risk management.While banks’ underwriting standards are generally stronger than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, the agencies are proposing the guidance now to reinforce sound portfolio-management principles that a bank should have in place when pursuing a commercial real estate lending strategy.\\xa0 A bank should be monitoring performance both on an individual-loan basis as well as on a collective basis for loans collateralized by similar property types or in the same markets.Some institutions’ strategic- and capital-planning processes may not adequately acknowledge the risks from their CRE concentrations.\\xa0 CRE lending in recent years has occurred under fairly benign credit conditions and, naturally, those conditions are unlikely to continue indefinitely.\\xa0 The ability of banks with significant concentrations to weather difficult market conditions will depend heavily on their risk-management processes and their level of capitalization.\\xa0 From a risk-management and capital perspective, institutions should generally focus on the emerging conditions in their real estate markets and on the potential cumulative impact on their portfolios if conditions deteriorate, and they should take other measures to help identify CRE vulnerabilities.\\xa0 Of course, these measures should vary according to the size of the organization and the level of the concentration.\\xa0 All of these steps are key elements of a sound strategy to manage concentrations.In evaluating the impact of their CRE concentrations, bankers should also pay attention to geographic factors.\\xa0 Many banks conduct successful CRE lending within a certain geographic area, but problems can arise when banks begin to lend outside their market or “footprint,” where they normally have better market intelligence.\\xa0 In recent years, supervisors have observed banks lending outside their established footprint--to maintain a customer relationship--into real estate markets with which they have less experience.\\xa0 The challenge is heightened when the borrower is also venturing into a new market.\\xa0 These practices led to significant losses in prior CRE credit downturns.I noted that CRE underwriting appears substantially better compared with the late 1980s and early 1990s.\\xa0 However, we have noticed some slippage recently.\\xa0 Therefore, the proposed CRE guidance underscores the existing interagency guidance on real estate lending standards.\\xa0 That is, it offers some reminders about risk-management practices for individual exposures.\\xa0 For example, banks may occasionally be inclined to make some compromises and concessions to borrowers in order to attract new business and sustain loan volume.\\xa0 As supervisors, we want to ensure that loan-to-value standards and debt-service-coverage ratios are meeting the organization’s policies--and that there is not an undue increase in the exceptions to those standards and ratios.\\xa0 We also continue to monitor whether lenders routinely adjust covenants, lengthen maturities, or reduce collateral requirements.\\xa0 To be clear, we have not yet seen underwriting standards fall to unsatisfactory levels on a broad scale, but we are concerned about some of the downward trend in these standards.It is important to note that no element of the proposed guidance is intended to act as a “trigger” or “hard limit” for immediate cutback or reversal of CRE lending; rather, the guidance is a reminder to institutions that certain risk-management standards are vitally important for banks involved in the business.\\xa0 Additionally, the agencies intend to use the proposed thresholds in the guidance only as a “first cut” or “screen” to identify institutions that may have heightened CRE concentration risk.\\xa0 The thresholds are intended to serve as benchmarks to identify banks where further information on portfolio risk management is needed.\\xa0 In some cases, after more careful review, supervisors may actually find that given the characteristics of its CRE portfolio an institution has sound risk management and is holding appropriate capital.\\xa0 In general, the proposed guidance is intended to be applied quite flexibly and in a manner consistent with the size and complexity of each organization.While supervisors continue to underscore the importance of having robust risk-management practices for CRE and other lending concentrations, we do acknowledge that banks may pursue a variety of approaches.\\xa0 In some cases, such as when there is not enough market data available or the relevant geographic market is small, banks may have to turn to less quantitative approaches.\\xa0 Nonetheless, those approaches should be robust, well documented, and transparent.\\xa0 This is consistent with the broader theme that risk management should be scaled to the institution.\\xa0 Along those same lines, we are not necessarily expecting smaller banks to be able to conduct regular, extensive and sophisticated quantitative stress tests around their lending concentrations.\\xa0 However, we do want bankers at smaller organizations to have clear and coherent methods for evaluating the various potential outcomes associated with such concentrations, and their exposures more broadly.Managing Business DisruptionsA number of events in the past half decade, including terrorist attacks and natural disasters, have reminded us of the importance of planning and preparation.\\xa0 Most recently, Hurricane Katrina underscored the critical role of business-continuity planning and disaster response for small businesses and small banks in local communities.\\xa0 Most financial institutions in the affected areas responded admirably to the extreme challenges posed by the hurricane and subsequent flooding, and the benefits of planning and preparation showed.\\xa0 I am sure that many of you in the audience today have studied the lessons from Katrina and improved your own plans for dealing with business disruptions.\\xa0 But I want to offer a supervisory perspective on potential lessons for bankers.Banks, like businesses everywhere, can be subject to wide-scale disruptions resulting from both natural and man-made disasters.\\xa0 Potential problems include destruction of facilities, missing personnel, power and communications outages, lack of transportation and fuel, interruption of mail and other delivery services, and health and safety crises.\\xa0 In short, services and activities normally taken for granted can be suddenly disrupted--and in some cases for an extended time.In 2003, U.S. supervisors issued revised guidance on business continuity planning that explicitly advises banks to factor the risk of a wide-scale disruption into their business continuity and disaster response plans.\\xa0 The experiences of bankers during and after Katrina confirmed the essential elements of good business-continuity management laid out in the guidance.\\xa0 As the first step in preparing for business disruptions, large or small, the guidance advises bankers to conduct a full evaluation of what it takes to run their business effectively and provide necessary services to their customers.\\xa0 This evaluation should include a variety of scenarios and possible events that could cause a business disruption.\\xa0 Bankers should then analyze the business impact of these possible disruptions, which could include a prolonged recovery period, and fashion appropriate responses.\\xa0 Once the business-continuity plan is developed, it should be implemented and tested regularly.\\xa0 It should also be updated whenever the bank expands or changes its business activities and when it gathers new information from tests or real-life events.When developing business-continuity plans, bankers need to understand that people are the most vital resource.\\xa0 Bankers should plan for ways to track and communicate with personnel through a range of channels, including ways to reach personnel if phone and electrical services are down, as they were after Katrina. \\xa0For banks operating in smaller geographic markets, it may be worthwhile to establish communication contacts outside of the region to be used by both employees and customers.\\xa0 Depending on the cause of the disruption, bankers should also expect that some of their personnel may be dealing with family emergencies that will limit their ability to work.\\xa0 Therefore, it is especially important to identify and train backup personnel to handle critical operations and services.Business-impact analysis and planning requires that bankers understand not only their business lines but also the systems and processes that support those business lines.\\xa0 The bank’s planning should address how these support systems and processes could be recovered if they are disrupted, including the effect such a disruption would have on the bank’s facilities, equipment, and other physical property.\\xa0 The bank may have to operate from backup or some type of recovery facilities for an extended period in order to provide critical services to customers.\\xa0 Employees may also need to be prepared to perform services manually if computer systems become unavailable.Hurricane Katrina also reminds us that unlike a fire, which may interrupt only the bank’s own activities as the community continues business as usual, a more widespread event causes banks to serve as agents of recovery for both their immediate and larger communities.\\xa0 I am sure that all of you understand, first, the importance of providing financial services in any community and, second, that you have a responsibility to provide those services to your customers and neighbors during a crisis.\\xa0 Accordingly, you should try to understand and coordinate your plans with the disaster-response programs for your neighborhood, city, and state.\\xa0 In fact, bankers’ knowledge of their critical systems needs can very often assist local government and utility company managers in better evaluating the impact of their preparedness on local customers.\\xa0 By the same token, you can improve your institution’s ability to respond by understanding the strengths and limitations of infrastructure around your bank, and the manner in which the community’s disaster-response efforts may unfold.Naturally, we cannot expect bankers to prepare for every conceivable event or plan for them with equal intensity.\\xa0 As with any aspect of risk management, bankers should assess the probability of an event and its potential consequences.\\xa0 We certainly understand that planning, preparation, and testing consume time, energy, and money.\\xa0 Accordingly, institutions should determine the most cost-effective way to mitigate risks and continue to assess which possible events deserve greater attention and preparation.ConclusionOur ongoing supervision of banking organizations indicates that a preponderance of institutions continue to be sound and well managed.\\xa0 This strong performance has occurred concurrently with institutions’ continued efforts to improve their risk-identification and management strategies. \\xa0That said, certain areas in banking operations, such as credit concentrations and business continuity planning, are placing pressures on risk-management systems. \\xa0In turn, supervisors are increasingly scrutinizing these and other relevant areas to ensure that management is fully aware of their risks and has made any necessary risk-management upgrades.Of course, bankers may be somewhat concerned about the impact that supervisory initiatives--even proposed guidance--could have on their business.\\xa0 We hear your concerns about regulatory burden, but I think it is helpful to remember that our job as regulators is to ensure that the United States has a safe and sound banking system.\\xa0 In other words, supervisors are in the business of monitoring “downside risk” to the financial system, so we must act appropriately when we see possibly excessive risk taking or inappropriate risk management.\\xa0 We also have a role in helping banks to prepare for potentially disruptive events.\\xa0 While most U.S. banking organizations today operate in a safe and sound manner and enjoy substantial profitability, they need to remember that continued business success depends on their ability to prepare for unexpected, and potentially much less favorable, events and outcomes.As institutions continue to offer new products and services, they face the challenge of incorporating the associated risks into their existing risk-management framework. \\xa0This is true for institutions of all sizes.\\xa0 But the manner in which risk-management challenges are addressed can--and should--vary across institutions, based on their size, complexity, and individual risk profile.\\xa0 Additionally, as supervisors, we want to ensure that institutions are not only identifying, measuring, and managing their risks but also developing and maintaining appropriate corporate-governance structures to keep up with their business activities and risk taking. \\xa0Our hope is that the guidance we offer to bankers on these various topics is becoming more consistent with their own practices for running an effective and profitable business. President Hockfield, members of the faculty, alumni, families and friends of graduates, and, especially, members of the 2006 graduating class: I am honored to speak at the 140th commencement exercises of this distinguished institution.It is wonderful to be back at MIT. I graduated from the Institute with a Ph.D. in economics in 1979. That year, President Weisner gave the commencement address. He spoke about, among other things, the nation’s transition from an era of cheap energy to one of energy scarcity and about the need for new technologies to aid in this transition. Obviously, these issues still confront us. One cannot help but wonder whether that theme will feel as current twenty-seven years from now as it does today.As for today, you may have been surprised at some point to learn that an economist rather than an engineer or scientist would be serving as your commencement speaker. But in my remarks, I hope to illustrate that this address continues a long and productive tradition of collaboration at MIT between economics and the engineering and scientific disciplines for which the Institute is so well-known. Building on that theme, I will discuss the essential complementarity of technology and economics in modern economies. Finally, I will have a few words to say about what you, as MIT graduates, can do to strengthen our economy and our society even as you pursue your personal and professional goals.A Short History of Economics at MITIf you will bear with me, I would like to begin with a short history of economics at MIT. The MIT Economics Department is, of course, the part of the Institute that I know best, and I hope to persuade you that it has played a special and unique role in this institution.MIT’s connection to economics dates at least to 1881, when Francis A. Walker became the institution’s third president. To say that Walker had already had a distinguished career would be an understatement. He was named a brevet brigadier general at the end of the Civil War, at the age of twenty-four. He served as the superintendent of the 1870 and 1880 Censuses of the United States and was one of the leading economists of his era. The year he arrived at MIT, he taught the first economics course ever offered at the Institute. The course covered political economy and was so popular that it was soon accorded its own course classification as \"Course IX, General Studies.\" Walker helped found the American Economic Association, still the leading professional association for economists. During his tenure at MIT, he moonlighted both as the first president of that association and as president of the American Statistical Association.In the early twentieth century, the economics program at MIT aimed to prepare undergraduates for leadership roles in business. During those years, economics as a discipline was gaining greater prominence both here and abroad. But the modern era of economics at MIT began in 1940--the year that Paul Samuelson, not yet having even received his doctorate, was persuaded to emigrate here from a somewhat less technically proficient institution located on another stretch of the Charles River. In part, Samuelson was willing to leave Harvard because his Foundations of Economic Analysis--a book now universally recognized by economists as inaugurating the modern mathematical approach to economics--was not well received by the old guard at the Harvard Economics Department.MIT’s Ph.D. program in economics was established a year after Samuelson arrived. Right from the start, the department attracted strong graduate students: The very first of these, Lawrence Klein, received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1980 for his work in econometric modeling. With support from MIT’s administration, the department expanded rapidly after World War II, and MIT led the development of a more mathematically rigorous approach to economics. Given the emphasis on quantitative reasoning at MIT, it makes perfect sense that the Economics Department here was in the vanguard of those using mathematics as a framework for organizing economic thought.These developments laid the foundation for economics as a discipline in the second half of the twentieth century, and the department quickly rose to the top of national rankings. Besides Samuelson, many economists contributed to the department’s outstanding reputation--Franco Modigliani, Robert Solow, Charles Kindleberger, Rudiger Dornbusch, and Stanley Fischer, to name just a few. Modigliani, Samuelson, and Solow won Nobel Prizes for their research. In addition, nine other economists with MIT connections have won Nobels.Mathematical approaches to economics have at times been criticized as lacking in practical value. Yet the MIT Economics Department has trained many economists who have played leading roles in government and in the private sector, including the current heads of four central banks: those of Chile, Israel, Italy, and, I might add, the United States. One of my teachers at MIT, Stan Fischer, is a sterling example of what MIT training can produce. Stan followed a brilliant career as a researcher and teacher at MIT with important work as a public servant, including top positions at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and, currently, the Bank of Israel.Why did economics at MIT become so successful? Perhaps Paul Samuelson and the people he helped to attract here could have been equally successful anywhere. But I suspect that the placement of economics in a milieu where quantitative reasoning and the scientific method are the coin of the realm was an important contributing factor. The Sloan School, with its close links both to the Economics Department and to other parts of the Institute, has benefited from the same milieu and has been the source of many fundamental advances as well. Notably, in recent years the global financial industry has been transformed by new quantitative approaches to pricing complex financial instruments such as derivatives and to measuring and managing risk. This transformation stemmed from the application of formal tools of mathematical economics that were developed to a substantial extent by faculty at the Sloan School, including Fischer Black, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes--the latter two of whom won Nobel Prizes for their work.As MIT economics has benefited from its proximity to the scientific and engineering expertise of MIT, so the Institute has benefited from the presence of a world-class economics department, over and above the addition of still more luster to the MIT name. The exposure of students and faculty from other divisions to the discipline and approaches of economics has stimulated creative thinking about how technology can be used to improve the economic welfare of the average person. That thought brings me to my second topic: the link between technology and economic growth.Translating Technological Advances into Economic GrowthAs has always been the case, technological change and innovation are today in large part driving economic growth and the improvement of living standards. But it is important to understand that even the very best ideas in science or engineering do not automatically translate into broader economic prosperity. In large measure, the material benefits of innovation spring from complementarities between technology and economics, where I include in \"economics\" not only economic ideas but also economic policies and, indeed, the entire economic system. When the economics is right, scientific and technological advances promote economic development, which in turn, in a virtuous circle, may provide resources and incentives that help to foster more innovation. A negative example is the former Soviet Union, which certainly did not lack for scientific and engineering talent but which had an economic system that was poorly suited for translating scientific advances into economic progress.The experience of the United States over the past decade illustrates the essential complementarity of technology and economics, in my view. Before the mid-1990s, the growth of productivity--the amount of output produced per worker or per hour of work--had been relatively sluggish for more than two decades in this country. As productivity is perhaps the single most important determinant of average living standards--a country in which the average worker can produce a lot is usually also a place in which the average person can consume a lot--the so-called productivity slowdown of that earlier period was the source of much concern among economists and policymakers. In the mid-1990s, however, productivity growth picked up in the United States. The growth rate of productivity increased still further around the turn of the century and remains strong today. This productivity revival augurs well for the future of the U.S. economy. But why did it happen?Differences in economic policies and systems likely account for some of the differences in performance--another example of the complementarity of technology and economics. One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity performance is that labor and product markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, and that these market characteristics have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from the new technologies. For example, taking full advantage of new information and communication technologies may require extensive reorganization of work practices, reassignment and retraining of workers, and ultimately some reallocation of labor among firms and industries. Regulations that raise the costs of hiring and firing workers and that reduce employers’ ability to change work assignments--like those in a number of European countries, for example--may make such changes more difficult to achieve. Likewise, in product markets, a high degree of competition and low barriers to the entry of new firms in most industries in the United States provide strong incentives for firms to find ways to cut costs and to improve their products. In some other countries, in contrast, the prominence of government-owned firms with a degree of monopoly power, together with a regulatory environment that protects large incumbent firms and makes the entry of new firms difficult, reduces the competitive pressure for innovation and the application of new ideas. Competition is one of the key benefits of free and open trade; companies that are exposed to global competition tend to be much more efficient and to produce goods of higher quality than companies that are sheltered from international competition.One interesting feature of the U.S. and global experience with major innovations is that often a significant amount of time passes between the initial development and diffusion of new technologies and the realization of the associated productivity benefits. Computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, for example, and personal computers came into widespread use beginning in the early 1980s. But until the mid-1990s these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity. Indeed, MIT’s Robert Solow famously quipped in 1987 that \"computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.\" Moreover, despite the sharp decline in information-technology investment after the meltdown of tech-sector stocks earlier this decade, the growth rate of productivity actually increased further in recent years, as I mentioned. These long lags raise additional questions about the nature of the links between new technologies and the resulting productivity gains.Looking to the FutureAs graduates of MIT, you will be at the heart of this critical process of developing new technologies and taking them to the marketplace. We are in an age in which technology and its fruits will be a dominant force not only in our economic lives but in the cultural, social, political, and personal aspects of our lives as well. Your training at MIT equips each of you exceptionally well to take the fullest advantage of the professional and personal opportunities that technological innovation and change will create.Each of you, because of your youth, your talent, your demonstrated commitment to learning, and your personal and intellectual attainments during your time at MIT, will soon find--to paraphrase Shakespeare--that the world is your oyster. I hope that you will contribute in some measure to economic progress, whether in the United States or elsewhere; and I hope you find some measure of financial reward. But the world has a great deal more to offer than money, and a key question each of you will face repeatedly in your lives is how to use the talent and education that you have been given and the knowledge that you have attained. With respect to your professional lives, I hope that when you make career choices, you will look first for opportunities that excite you intellectually, that allow you to use your creative powers to the fullest extent, and that let you continue to learn and grow. I hope you will not be afraid to be unconventional, to do something nobody else has thought of before. Remember that the path to success and fulfillment may not be well marked, the scaling of some predetermined ladder; it may instead be a road without signs or maps. And remember that it is OK to fail--really: New opportunities will always arise for those who seek them. If you remain nimble in searching out new and unexpected opportunities, it will not only benefit you, but it will also benefit the economy and our society, as long experience has shown that dynamism and creativity are the seeds of innovation and of progress.In the personal sphere, as you make your way in the world, I hope you will not forget the importance of your family and how much it has already contributed to your journey through life. Remember, too, family members are the ones who will still love you even when things aren’t going so well. Even as you focus intensively on your professional interests, I hope you will remain intellectually broad--well-read, well-informed, and open to new experiences. And finally, I hope you will remain engaged with the broader society. That may involve entering public service at some point, as many MIT graduates have chosen to do. But it need not. There are always opportunities to make a difference in the world, through volunteering, civic participation, charitable activities, or the type of work you choose to do.I congratulate all graduates and your families for what you have accomplished and wish you the very best for the future.Footnotes Good evening, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you. I am sure that, both in your academic studies and your practical experience, each of you has come to appreciate the rapid pace of change in the financial industry and the increasing complexity of that industry. My remarks will focus on an area that is evolving particularly quickly: the field of risk management. As you know, contemporary banking organizations are exposed to a diverse set of market and nonmarket risks, and the management of risk has accordingly become a core function within banks. Banks have invested in risk management for the good economic reason that their shareholders and creditors demand it. But bank supervisors, such as the Federal Reserve, also have an obvious interest in promoting strong risk management at banking organizations because a safe and sound banking system is critical to economic growth and to the stability of financial markets. Indeed, identifying, assessing, and promoting sound risk-management practices have become central elements of good supervisory practice.The evolution of risk management as a discipline has thus been driven by market forces on the one hand and developments in banking supervision on the other, each side operating with the other in complementary and mutually reinforcing ways. Banks and other market participants have made many of the key innovations in risk measurement and risk management, but supervisors have often helped to adapt and disseminate best practices to a broader array of financial institutions. And at times, supervisors have taken the lead, for example, by identifying emerging issues through examinations and comparisons of peer institutions or by establishing guidelines that codify evolving practices.The interaction between the private and public sectors in the development of risk-management techniques has been particularly extensive in the field of bank capital regulation, especially for the banking organizations that are the largest, most complex, and most internationally active. The current system of bank capital standards is the so-called Basel I framework, which was established internationally in 1988. Basel I was an important advance that resulted in higher capital levels, a more equitable international marketplace and--most relevant to my theme this evening--closer links between banks\\' capital holdings and the risks they take. However, as I will discuss, Basel I is becoming increasingly inadequate for our largest and most complex organizations. The activities of these organizations demand that we not only go beyond Basel I but that we continue to improve on today\\'s most advanced methods of risk management. Thus, in the proposed new framework, known as Basel II, supervisors are seeking to draw upon industry best practice while also encouraging the industry to advance the risk-management frontier.The Evolution in Risk-Management PracticesRisk-management practices and bank supervision have both evolved over their long histories, but innovations in information technology and in financial markets have caused the pace of change to increase significantly over the past two decades. In particular, the management of market risk and credit risk has become increasingly sophisticated.Market RiskFor example, in the area of market risk, advances in data processing have enabled more analytically advanced and more comprehensive evaluations of the interest rate risks associated with individual transactions, portfolios, and even entire organizations. Institutions of all sizes now regularly apply concepts such as duration, convexity, and option-adjusted spreads in the context of analyses that ten years ago would have taxed the processing capabilities of all but a handful of large institutions. From the perspective of bank management and stockholders, the availability of advanced methods for managing interest rate risk leads to a more favorable risk-return tradeoff. For supervisors, the benefit is a greater resilience of the banking system in the face of a risk that figured prominently in some past episodes of banking problems.Other market risks are those inherent in trading and dealer activities. The management of such risks has also advanced significantly, in large part as a result of the growth and development of over-the-counter derivatives markets. Critical concepts such as value-at-risk and stress testing were pioneered and then became standard practice during the 1990s, advances that, again, were facilitated by the growth of computing power in that decade. Over the past few decades, banks\\' management of their capital-market risks has evolved from simple methods like the imposition of fixed position limits to increasingly sophisticated techniques that make use of extensive data analyses and a variety of new financial instruments.Supervisors have encouraged the continuous improvement of banks\\' systems for managing market risk by emphasizing that bankers bear responsibility for understanding and managing their risk profiles and by issuing guidance that, in some cases, includes industry advances in risk management. A case in point is the 1996 Market Risk Amendment to Basel I, in which supervisors incorporated industry innovations in the calculation of capital requirements for market risk, including the linking of capital charges to the outputs of banks\\' own value-at-risk models.Credit RiskThe banking industry has also made strides in managing credit risk. Until the early 1990s, the analysis of credit risk was generally limited to reviews of individual loans, and banks kept most loans on their books to maturity. Today, credit-risk management encompasses both loan reviews and portfolio analysis. Moreover, the development of new technologies for buying and selling risks has allowed many banks to move away from the traditional book-and-hold lending practice in favor of a more active strategy that seeks the best mix of assets in light of the prevailing credit environment, market conditions, and business opportunities. Much more so than in the past, banks today are able to manage and control obligor and portfolio concentrations, maturities, and loan sizes, and to address and even eliminate problem assets before they create losses. Many banks also stress-test their portfolios on a business-line basis to help inform their overall risk management.To an important degree, banks can be more active in their management of credit risks and other portfolio risks because of the increased availability of financial instruments and activities such as loan syndications, loan trading, credit derivatives, and securitization. For example, trading in credit derivatives has grown rapidly over the last decade, reaching $18 trillion (in notional terms) in 2005. The notional value of trading in credit default swaps on many well-known corporate names now exceeds the value of trading in the primary debt securities of the same obligors. Similarly, between 1990 and 2005, the market for loan syndications grew from $700 billion to more than $2.5 trillion, and loan trading grew from less than $10 billion to more than $160 billion. Asset-backed securitization has also provided a vehicle for decreasing concentrations and credit risk in bank portfolios by permitting the sale of loans in the capital markets, particularly loans on homes and commercial real estate.Risk-management principles are now ingrained in banks\\' day-to-day credit allocation activities. The most sophisticated banking organizations use risk-rating systems that characterize credits by both the probability of default and the expected loss given default. Consistent with the principles of the Basel II accord, the largest banks evaluate credit decisions by augmenting expert judgment with quantitative, model-based techniques. For instance, lending to individuals once relied mainly on the personal judgments of loan officers and was thus highly labor-intensive and subjective. Today, retail lending has become more routinized as banks have become increasingly adept at predicting default risk by applying statistical models to data, such as credit scores.Similarly, new analytical tools and techniques have made lending to corporate borrowers highly quantitative. Among these tools are models that estimate the risk-adjusted return on capital and thus allow lenders to price relevant risks before loan origination. Other tools include proprietary internal debt-rating models and third-party programs that use market data to analyze the risk of exposures to corporate borrowers that issue stock.Banks have also come to appreciate the importance of independent controls within the credit review and rating process. Innovations in technology have facilitated significant improvements in bank information systems, a development that the Basel II proposal also has encouraged. These systems increase the ability of bank management to identify, measure, and control key characteristics of portfolio risk. Evolution of Banking Supervision and Capital RegulationTo help fulfill their mandate to monitor and protect the safety and soundness of the financial sector, bank supervisors have consistently encouraged the development of risk management. Through guidance and the supervisory process, they have highlighted advances in sound risk-management practices and encouraged the industry to implement them broadly and consistently. Indeed, the four key elements of sound risk management that are widely accepted today were articulated more than a decade ago by Federal Reserve supervisors in guidance on managing derivatives activities and interest-rate risk. Those four elements are, first, good corporate governance--that is, active oversight by the board and senior management; second, the consistent application of policies, procedures, and limits; third, the use of appropriate risk-measurement techniques and reporting; and, fourth, the adoption of comprehensive internal controls.Since the mid-1990s, Federal Reserve supervisors have rated banks\\' risk-management capability as well as their financial condition as part of the examination process. Last year the Federal Reserve introduced a revised rating system for bank holding companies, under which each company receives a rating specifically for the quality of its risk management. This rating includes the four key elements of sound risk management that I just mentioned.The increasing supervisory focus on risk-management practices has also had a large influence on the practice of bank supervision. Traditional supervision consisted primarily of periodic assessments of loan quality. In the early 1990s, bank supervisors began to concentrate more on the forward-looking issues of risk and whether the bank has the infrastructure to manage risks. Under this approach, examiners focus their on-site reviews on those activities that appear to pose the greatest risk to the banking organization. The objective is to address weaknesses in management and internal controls before financial performance suffers rather than being satisfied with identifying what went wrong after the fact. At the heart of the modern bank examination is an assessment of the quality of a bank\\'s procedures for evaluating, monitoring, and managing risk, and of the bank\\'s internal models for determining economic capital. These models link capital to risk-taking and help banking organizations compare risks and returns across diverse business lines and locations.Both robust risk management and strong capital positions are critical to ensure that individual banking organizations operate in a safe and sound manner that enhances the stability of the financial system. More generally, strong capital helps banks absorb unexpected shocks and reduces the moral hazard associated with the federal safety net.Why Basel II?In introducing the concept of risk-based capital ratios, Basel I established the important principle that regulatory capital requirements should be related to risk. At various times, of course, supervisors have also made important adjustments to the Basel I framework, such as the Market Risk Amendment mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, advances in risk management and the increasing complexity of financial activities have prompted international supervisors to review the appropriateness of regulatory capital standards under Basel I, particularly for the largest and most complex banking organizations. The supervisory organizations have agreed that Basel I, with its broad-brush system for setting the risk weights on various classes of bank assets, is increasingly inadequate for measuring risk and the appropriate level of capital for such firms. For example, under Basel I, a bank\\'s regulatory capital requirement takes no account of the specific risk profile of its commercial loan portfolio, deterioration in asset quality, the risks of certain off-balance-sheet transactions or fee-based activities, and actions banks may take to mitigate balance sheet risks. Supervisors recognize that some of the largest and most complex banking organizations have already moved well beyond Basel I in the sophistication of their risk management and internal capital models. As risk-management practices continue to evolve, the gulf between the determinants of minimum regulatory capital under Basel I and what these banks actually do to manage risk will widen. Most important, if the regulatory capital required of these organizations does not adequately reflect the risks they are actually taking, the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system may be jeopardized.The U.S. banking agencies have proposed the adoption of the Basel II accord because it links the risk-taking of large banking organizations to their regulatory capital in a more meaningful way than does Basel I and encourages further progress in risk management. It does this by building on the risk-measurement and risk-management practices of the most sophisticated banking organizations and providing incentives for further improvements. Moreover, by providing a framework to be applied consistently across banks, Basel II will make it easier for supervisors to identify banks whose capital is not commensurate with their risk levels and to evaluate emerging risks in the banking system as a whole.Broadly, the Basel II framework encompasses three pillars. Pillar 1 is risk-focused minimum regulatory capital requirements, pillar 2 is supervisory review, and pillar 3 is market discipline. Under pillar 1, the risk sensitivity of minimum risk-based capital requirements would be much greater than under the current accord. This greater sensitivity would be achieved by linking each banking organization\\'s capital requirement to empirically based measures of credit and operational risk; these measures would be determined in part by risk parameters estimated by the banks, such as a loan\\'s probability of default and its expected loss given default. The methods used to construct these estimates would be subject to regulatory requirements and supervisory guidance and review, including a requirement that the risk parameters used for pillar 1 be consistent with risk assessments actually used by the bank for its internal risk management. The pillar 1 treatment of credit risk also reflects more accurately the risk-reducing effects of guarantees, credit derivatives, and securitization, thus improving regulatory capital incentives for banks to hedge credit risks. The incorporation of operational risk in pillar 1 is based on the recognition that, indeed, operational failures are a potentially important risk that banks should seek to minimize.Pillar 2 of the new accord provides a consistent framework for improving supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and risk management. Under pillar 2, a bank would be required to maintain capital in excess of the regulatory minimums to capture the full set of risks to which the bank is exposed. These include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and concentration risk, none of which are reflected in pillar 1. Currently, U.S. banking regulators assess a bank\\'s overall capital adequacy as a normal part of the examination process. But the overall quality of assessments of capital adequacy, both by supervisor and by each bank, should improve greatly under Basel II because of the expanded information that will be available from pillar 1, from supervisory reviews under pillar 2, and from the bank\\'s own analyses.Under pillar 3, banks will be required to disclose to the public the new risk-based capital ratios and more-extensive information about the credit quality of their portfolios and their practices in measuring and managing risk. Such disclosures should make banks more transparent to financial markets and thereby improve market discipline.Taken together, these three pillars provide a broad and coherent framework for linking regulatory capital to risk, for improving internal risk measurement and management, and for enhancing supervisory and market discipline at large, complex, internationally active banks. The three pillars build on the risk-management approaches of well-managed banks and better align regulatory and supervisory practices with the way the best-run banks are actually managed. As a result, Basel II will be better able than the current system to adapt over time to innovations in banking and markets. In addition, Basel II sets standards for the measurement and management of risk and for related disclosures that will give banks ongoing incentives to improve their practices in these areas.Proposals to Amend Basel IMany of you here today have also been following discussions about possible changes to the existing Basel I framework, proposals known collectively as \"Basel IA.\" Only the very largest banking organizations will be required (or will choose) to adopt the Basel II framework. The vast majority of U.S. banks would be able to continue operating safely under Basel I as amended through the rulemaking process. The Basel I framework has already been amended more than twenty-five times in response to changes in the banking environment. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to amend the Basel I rules.Last fall, the U.S. banking agencies issued preliminary proposals that outline suggested changes to Basel I. In part, these proposed changes are meant to address concerns about the potential adverse competitive effects of Basel II. The Federal Reserve takes concerns about competitive effects seriously and has conducted substantial research on the topic. During the process to amend Basel I, we sought input from the industry and other interested parties. In view of those concerns, regulators have proposed changes to enhance the risk sensitivity of U.S. Basel I rules; we also remain vigilant about identifying potential competitive distortions that might be created with the introduction of Basel II.We are also mindful that amendments to Basel I should not be too complex or too burdensome for the multitude of smaller banks to which the revised rules would apply. That is, in amending Basel I for these institutions, we are trying to find the right balance between added risk sensitivity and regulatory burden. That balance is not necessarily easy to find. For example, one way to tie regulatory capital more closely to risk under Basel I would be to expand the number of factors used to determine risk weights--for example, to include credit scores or external credit ratings. The tradeoff is that incorporating additional risk measures is likely to increase the burden of calculating regulatory capital. The comments received suggest that institutions differ on how best to make this tradeoff. We will continue to evaluate this tradeoff and solicit further comments on how to proceed.ConclusionWe expect that risk management and banking supervision will continue to develop along parallel tracks. The Basel II framework represents an important effort by supervisors to integrate leading-edge risk management practices with the calculation of regulatory capital requirements. The ongoing work on this framework has already led large, complex banking organizations to improve their systems for identifying, measuring, and managing their risks. Indeed, banking organizations of all sizes have made substantial strides over the past two decades in their ability to measure and manage risks. The banking agencies will continue to promote supervisory approaches that complement and support banks\\' own efforts to enhance their risk-management capabilities.Footnotes Thank you for the invitation to speak here today. I am impressed by the range of interesting subjects covered in your program, and I hope that my remarks on enterprise risk management will be informative as well.Today I will look at some recent cases in which we believe bankers and supervisors have learned some key lessons about enterprise risk management, or ERM. These lessons demonstrate how good risk management increases business efficiency and profitability. Naturally, what we\\'ve learned from the banking industry can be more broadly applied to other industries and sectors. Indeed, one could argue that ERM can improve management of many different types of entities, including government agencies and nonprofit organizations. But before I start discussing particular examples, I want to take a step back and give you my thoughts on ERM generally.General Thoughts on Enterprise Risk ManagementThe financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by emerging technologies and business processes, new financial instruments, the growing scale and scope of financial institutions, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve, as the supervisor of state member banks and bank and financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. The Federal Reserve has long emphasized the need for appropriate and strong internal controls in institutions we supervise, and we have taken a continuous-improvement approach to our risk-focused examinations. For many years, enterprise risk management across multiple organizational units within an entity has received increased scrutiny.In some cases, firms may be practicing good risk management on an exposure-by-exposure basis, but they may not be paying close enough attention to aggregation of exposures across the entire organization. Rapid growth can place considerable pressure on, among other areas, an organization\\'s management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, and asset/liability management. An organization must also understand how its various business components, some of which can be quite sophisticated and complex, dynamically interact. A successful ERM process can help an organization to meet many of these challenges.Of course, enterprise risk management is a fairly broad topic that can mean different things to different people. For our purposes here today, I will define ERM as a process that enables management to effectively deal with uncertainty and associated risk and opportunity, enhancing the capacity to build stakeholder value. Borrowing from ERM literature, I would say that ERM includesSome of you are probably familiar with the ERM framework published over a year ago by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework provides a useful way to look at ERM and helps generate further discussion.In the COSO framework, ERM consists of eight interrelated components derived from the way management runs an enterprise and integrated with the management process: (1) internal environment, (2) objective setting, (3) event identification, (4) risk assessment, (5) risk response, (6) control activities, (7) information and communication, and (8) monitoring. Each of these is described in more detail in the COSO literature.Notably, the COSO framework states explicitly that, while its components will not function identically within every entity, its principles should apply to all sizes of institutions. Small and mid-size entities, for example, may choose to apply the framework in a less formal and less structured way and scale it to their own needs--as long as quality is maintained. This underscores the message from bank supervisors that good risk management is expected of every institution, regardless of size or sophistication. Naturally, there will still be some tension between what supervisors expect and what bankers do, but we hope that supervisory expectations for risk management are becoming more and more aligned with the way that bankers run their businesses.I would now like to discuss a few recent examples from banking that highlight the importance of ERM. With the benefit of hindsight, the financial regulators and the industry have been trying to distill the lessons learned from these recent breakdowns in risk management and internal control in the financial services sector.Compliance RiskOne area in which ERM provides tangible value is the area of compliance risk, which can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to an organization\\'s reputation and franchise value. This type of risk may arise when an organization fails to comply with the laws, regulations, or codes of conduct that are applicable to its business activities and functions. The Federal Reserve expects banking organizations to have in place an infrastructure that can identify, monitor, and effectively control the compliance risks that they face. Needless to say, the infrastructure should be commensurate with the nature of the organization\\'s compliance risk. For a large complex banking organization, dealing with compliance risk can be particularly challenging unless it has a well-developed risk-management program.To create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organizations should first understand compliance risk across the entire entity. Understandably, this can be a daunting task, but I think most would agree that an effective risk assessment is critical. Managers should be expected to evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually.An enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program should be dynamic and proactive. It should constantly assess evolving risks when new business lines or activities are added, when existing activities and processes are altered or when there are regulatory changes. The process should include an assessment of how those changes may affect the level and nature of risk exposures, and whether mitigating controls are effective in limiting exposures to targeted levels. To avoid having a program that operates on autopilot, an organization must continuously reassess its risks and controls and communicate with all employees who are part of the compliance process. If compliance is seen as a one-off project, an organization risks facing a situation down the road where its compliance program has not kept up with the changes in its organization. Also, the board of directors needs to ensure the organization has a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is well communicated by senior management so that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities. Clear lines of communication and authority help to avoid conflicts of interest.Compliance-risk management can be more difficult for management to integrate into an organization\\'s regular business processes because it often reflects mandates set out by legislation or regulation that the organization itself does not view as key to its success. For example, bankers understand how vital credit-risk management and interest-rate risk management are to their organizations, because they reduce the volatility of earnings and limit losses. However, regulations enacted for broader societal purposes can be viewed as an expensive mandate. For example, the Patriot Act requires significant reporting of transactions to the government, and many in industry have expressed frustration about the burden associated with such reporting. I can assure you, we recognize banking organizations\\' investment in and commitment to compliance with regulatory requirements, including those imposed by anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism regulations. The Federal Reserve will continue to work with our counterparts in the federal government to encourage enhanced feedback on how reporting is contributing to our common fight against money laundering and terrorism.Operational RiskOver the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been increasing its focus on operational risk. For many nonfinancial organizations, the largest share of enterprise risk is likely to be operational risk, as opposed to credit and interest-rate risk. Banks have learned much from the practices that nonfinancial firms have developed over the years. Operational risk has more relevance today for bankers largely because they are able to shed much of their interest-rate and credit risk through sales of loans, use of financial derivatives and sound models to manage the risks that are retained. Further, the revenue streams that are growing the fastest are increasingly related to transaction processing, servicing accounts, and selling sophisticated financial products. To be successful, organizations must have complex systems to execute these activities.Banks are also utilizing advanced models to estimate and manage credit-risk and market-risk exposures. Growing use of sophisticated models requires stronger risk-management practices since weaknesses in the models\\' operational design and data integrity can lead to significant losses. Thus, effective risk management requires financial institutions to have more-knowledgeable employees to identify system requirements, monitor their effectiveness, and interpret model results appropriately.We have learned quite a bit about operational risk from our examinations of banking organizations. For example, during routine examinations we look at the adequacy of banks\\' procedures, processes, and internal controls. Such reviews include transaction testing of control routines in higher-risk activities. For example, a bank\\'s wire transfer activities and loan administration functions are often targeted for review, and our experiences have identified some common weaknesses in operational control that are worthy of attention.With wire transfers and similar transactions, a banking organization could suffer a significant financial loss from unauthorized transfers and incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risks are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from our reviews are to (1) establish reasonable approval and authorization requirements for wire transactions to ensure that an appropriate level of management is aware of the transaction and to establish better accountability; (2) establish call-back procedures, passwords, funds transfer agreements, and other authentication controls related to customers\\' wire transfer requests; and (3) pay increased attention to authentication controls, since this area may also be particularly susceptible to external fraud.Loan administration is another area where banking organizations could suffer significant financial losses from inappropriate segregation of duties or lack of dual controls. An institution could also incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risk factors are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from these types of reviews that may be applied to corporations more generally are to (1) ensure that loan officers do not have the ability to book and maintain their own loans; (2) confine employee access to only those loan system computer applications that are consistent with their responsibilities; and (3) provide line staff with consistent guidance, in the form of policies and procedures, on how to identify and handle unusual transactions.Operational Risk Arising In Recent Financial RestatementsRisks can sometimes quickly appear where they were not traditionally expected. For example, consider the changes we have seen in financial reporting quality of corporations in all industries. In 2005, there were approximately 1,200 restatements of previously filed financial statements by publicly traded companies--twice the rate for 2004. The complexity of generally accepted accounting principles and a more stringent, literal interpretation of the application of those standards by auditors and regulatory bodies, primarily the Securities and Exchange Commission, are two major factors that have led to the restatements.Examples of prominent restatements include FAS 133 hedge accounting and lease accounting issues. In the area of hedge accounting, the restatements generally resulted from the misapplication of the \"short-cut\" method. The organizations in question did not satisfy all of the criteria for use of the short-cut method but, nonetheless, utilized hedge accounting treatment allowed by this method.In the area of lease accounting issues, most companies simply failed to apply longstanding accounting standards related to revenue recognition reserves, accruals and contingencies, and equity accounting. Most companies believed they were actually reporting correctly prior to the restatements. Virtually all of these companies were audited by auditing firms that are now registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB\\'s inspection process, which involves close scrutiny of registered firms, may be a factor in the increased number of restatements.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires each annual report of a public company to include a report by management on the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Restatements by banking organizations alone resulted in the revision of a number of material weaknesses in internal control for the 2004 reporting period, fifty-two from the thirty-seven originally reported. This increase implies a significant amount of operational risk associated with the accounting process.Generally, examiners review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has a clear understanding of the roles of the audit committee, management, internal audit, and the external auditor and whether the organization has implemented an effective plan to achieve the objectives and requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley 404. Examiners also review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has an effective follow-up strategy for the remediation of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Examiners are encouraged to utilize the results of the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process, where possible, in their overall assessment of the organization\\'s risk-management and control process and in the risk scoping of safety-and-soundness examinations and inspections.Information SecurityIssues involving information security and identity theft have received quite a bit of attention from the federal government over the past several years. In fact, just recently, President Bush signed an executive order that created an Identity Theft Task Force for the purpose of strengthening federal efforts to protect against identity theft. The heads of the federal bank regulatory agencies are designated members of this task force; and as supervisors of financial institutions, I believe we can offer a unique perspective on this issue.As you have probably noticed, cyber attacks and security breaches involving nonpublic customer information appear in the headlines almost every week. These events have cost the financial services industry millions of dollars in direct losses and have done considerable reputational damage. The cost of identity theft to affected consumers is also significant. With banking organizations increasingly using the Internet to interact with customers, business partners, and service providers, concerns about the use of the Internet as a communication and delivery channel have resulted in the need for and use of more-sophisticated control mechanisms, such as enterprise-wide firewall protections, multifactor authentication schemes, and virtual private-network connections.While many of the widely publicized information security breaches have involved parties outside the affected banking organization accessing the organization\\'s customer information, organizations also remain at risk for breaches or misuses of information by an insider. During our examination activities, we have seen breakdowns in internal control, resulting in operating losses that were traced back to weak controls over insiders\\' access to information technology systems interfacing with electronic funds transfer networks. Further investigation into these situations suggests that the duration and magnitude of the fraud and resulting losses is a direct function of the internal party\\'s access to accounting and related systems.Several lessons have emerged. First, institutions should tightly control logical access to funds transfer systems and ensure that access settings enforce separation of duties, dual controls, and management sign-offs. Second, an institution\\'s senior management should be restricted from regular access to business-line functional systems, especially funds transfer systems. When such restriction is impractical, additional controls must be in place and functioning effectively. Finally, effective management of information security risk, even when focused on a specific function, requires an enterprise-wide approach to yield a true and complete evaluation of the associated risks.Mutual FundsWell-publicized instances of late trading and market timing at mutual fund firms, and the related investigations, have involved many businesses, including banking, securities, and insurance firms. These types of breakdowns in internal control result in sanctions or financial loss and adversely affect a firm\\'s reputation and franchise value.I would like to highlight a few lessons learned from our experience in investigating control breaches in these mutual fund cases. One of the most obvious is the need to critically evaluate unusual client relationships that require variances from standard procedures. If a high percentage of compensation is derived from a single client, a red flag should immediately go up. Also, organizations should have a formal process for reviewing and approving unique products, customers, and services at the inception of the client relationship. Furthermore, it is always a good idea to shine some light on areas historically labeled \"low risk\" to validate that assessment. The low occurrence of loss from an activity should not be the only factor considered when assessing risk.Finally, compensation systems that reward employees for sales without adequately monitoring their internal control breaches can create a conflict between the interest of employees and the interest of the enterprise. As companies move away from straight salaries to more incentive-based systems, it is important that personnel departments be included in an effective enterprise-wide risk-management program to consider how changes in compensation practices affect risks to the enterprise.Credit DerivativesI would now like to turn to one more issue that has relevance to ERM, and that is the importance of companies including an ERM perspective as they design and build new lines of business. As many of you might know, last year a dialogue between supervisors and credit derivatives dealers was initiated to support industry efforts to address weaknesses in the operations surrounding credit default swaps (CDS). While we view these new instruments as an effective way to diversify and mitigate risks related to credit exposures from corporations, an industry-led study, the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II report, identified significant weaknesses in the infrastructure supporting sales and risk monitoring of these instruments. While the report identified forty-seven recommendations, regulators in the United States and other countries have focused on two major weaknesses.One weakness relates to the lack of discipline in enforcing contract terms. Any time an instrument is traded over the counter, it is important to know with whom you are doing business. Since an exchange does not stand between the two sides of the trade, parties make payments directly to each other to honor the terms of the contracts. The market practice is to use collateral or pricing to mitigate the risk that the other side of the trade cannot perform according to the agreement. The recent industry study also found that competitive pressures were such that brokers were not enforcing the standard CDS agreement, because their counterparties were routinely assigning the trade to another party without the broker\\'s prior consent. As a result, dealers often did not have a real-time understanding of the counterparty exposure. Obviously, this can significantly change the risk profile of a transaction and also make it very difficult to settle payments in a timely manner.Another weakness is related to the success of the product. Trading volume has grown so quickly and reached such a significant level that broker-dealers\\' paper-based systems to record the trades and document the transactions have not been able to keep up. As a result, significant backlogs of confirmations of these over-the-counter derivatives built up. This creates concerns that information feeding risk-management systems--information about the volume, term, and counterparty to the trade--is not complete. This problem would be exacerbated in a stress situation, when positions need to be changed very quickly to mitigate risk.A few months ago, fourteen major market participants published a letter reiterating their commitment to improving the infrastructure that supports the credit derivatives markets. The market participants are committed to the development and implementation of a set of industrywide guidelines that include a targeted reduction in each market participant\\'s confirmation backlogs and assurance that agreement terms will be enforced. Additionally, the fourteen participants will work to create a largely electronic marketplace in which all trades will be processed through an industry-accepted platform, develop a new set of processing standards for those trades that cannot be confirmed electronically, and establish a new procedure for settlement following a credit event.We are generally pleased with both the industry\\'s self-identification of the issues and its commitment to making improvements. But for purposes of our discussion of ERM today, the problems surrounding CDS sales highlight the challenges risk managers face when market pressures make the firm\\'s line management reluctant to initiate appropriate controls on their own. It also illustrates that in new lines of business, sometimes ERM must go outside the enterprise and work with competitors to support the growth of shared systems and standards to mitigate risks.ConclusionAt the Federal Reserve, we believe that all banking organizations need good risk management. An enterprise-wide approach is appropriate for setting objectives across the organization, instilling an enterprise-wide culture, and ensuring that key activities and risks are being monitored regularly. In many ways, bankers have learned from nonfinancial industries about ERM. In other cases, banks\\' application of ERM may hold lessons for entities outside the financial sector. Whichever the case, it is clear that there is always an opportunity to improve upon ERM strategies and maintain the proper discipline to implement them effectively. Thank you for the invitation to speak today on an issue of great interest to many of us, that is, compliance-risk management and supervisory expectations. Over the last few years, legal and regulatory compliance breakdowns have attracted increased attention across the financial industry. Fortunately, most of you have responded to your evolving compliance risks by investing in effective compliance-risk management programs. However, now and then, headline-grabbing incidents of noncompliance continue to capture public attention, especially when they involve such sensitive areas as fair lending and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Conferences such as this are valuable opportunities for you, as compliance experts, to share experiences and successful approaches to controlling compliance risk.To assist you in your efforts to fine-tune your compliance-risk management programs, I\\'d like to give you a sense of what Federal Reserve examiners look for when they conduct examinations. I will also take a few minutes to address our more focused work in two particularly important areas of regulatory compliance: compliance with BSA requirements and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data reporting requirements. Otherwise, I will not focus on examinations that look solely at the level of compliance with specific laws and regulations but will focus on how examiners assess the adequacy of a compliance-risk management program and its ability to manage the organization\\'s compliance risk.Compliance-Risk ManagementOverall, a banking organization\\'s compliance-risk management program should enable it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the compliance risks involved in its various products and lines of business. These are fundamental principles not only for compliance-risk management, but also for sound management of credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.It\\'s worth taking a moment to define compliance risk. It is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation and franchise value that may arise when an organization fails to comply with laws, regulations, or standards or codes of conduct of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities and functions of the banking organization.While all banking organizations should have a program in place to effectively manage compliance risk, these programs can vary considerably, depending on the size, complexity, and geographic reach of the banking organization and the inherent risks of its activities. As with other types of risk, large multinational organizations will require more elaborate and formal compliance-risk management systems to address their broader and typically more complex range of financial activities and to provide senior managers and directors with the information they need to monitor and direct activities. Therefore, our supervisory expectations regarding an organization\\'s risk-management program, and more specifically the scope of an examination, will vary according to the organization\\'s size and complexity.Assessing the Adequacy of Compliance-Risk Management ProgramsThe Federal Reserve\\'s supervisory approach in the area of compliance-risk management is consistent with our long-standing focus on the adequacy of banking organizations\\' overall management of risk. To this end, Federal Reserve examiners assess the quality of a banking organization\\'s systems for identifying, measuring, and containing its risks. While historically there has been a greater emphasis on risk management in the areas of credit, market, operational, and liquidity risk, because of the growing complexity of banking operations and their regulatory frameworks the Federal Reserve is taking a greater interest in banking organizations\\' ability to manage their compliance risk.Scoping the ExaminationGenerally, a Federal Reserve examination team begins by defining the scope of the examination; this is when examiners determine the areas of focus and level of scrutiny. The scope of the examination will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the banking organization. For example, as part of the scoping exercise, examiners will consider previous examination and audit findings to determine whether the organization has a satisfactory history of compliance or whether there have been previous concerns about its compliance-risk management program. The examination team will also review the organization\\'s compliance-risk assessment. Depending on its quality, the risk assessment can also help direct the resources of the examination team. Altogether, the information gleaned from examination and audit findings and a current risk assessment will directly affect the scope of the examination, including the level and area of transaction testing required to assess the adequacy of the compliance-risk management program. At institutions with a less satisfactory record, a more extensive review will be necessary.Federal Reserve examinations for compliance-risk management are not designed to be gotcha games in which examiners look for one-time breaches of specific regulations or laws. Rather, these examinations are designed to assess the adequacy of the structure and processes the institution uses for managing compliance risk. Examiners are expected to look for the bigger picture and to look at the effectiveness of the program (including policies and processes) for managing the organization\\'s compliance risk. We want to understand whether you have the controls in place to manage the risk of your organization.As with all areas of risk management, our expectations--and therefore the scope of many examinations in this area--are framed by an emphasis onI\\'ll give you a sense of some of the key components that examiners are likely to look for when assessing these fundamental areas.Board and Senior Management OversightA successful compliance-risk management program starts at the top of the organization. It is essential that the board of directors takes the lead by requiring a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is incorporated into the organization\\'s day-to-day operations and is well communicated by senior management so that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities and their roles in implementing the enterprise-wide program. Examiners will look to understand the board and senior management\\'s roles in setting and communicating the compliance culture within the organization.Examiners will also look to see that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated throughout the organization and that senior management and staff understand their compliance obligations. In order for the board and senior management to carry out their responsibilities, they need to understand the organization\\'s current compliance risks. We have seen organizations that have experienced challenges as a result of a lack of clarity in this area as they grow and diversify.Examiners will determine whether the organization has an effective risk assessment that accurately identifies its compliance risks and whether material risks are communicated to the board. Effective risk assessment measures the risk presented by clients, products and services, and geographic exposure within specific business lines or activities and aggregates these risks across the organization.Risk assessment is critical not only to ensure that the board and senior management is well informed. It also serves as the foundation for risk-based policies, procedures, and internal controls. Examiners will look to understand the organization\\'s risk-assessment process. For example, they will look to see the degree to which the business lines are involved, how frequently the risk assessment is updated, and how it incorporates new products, services, or legal entities.Human and financial resources are, of course, critical to effective performance.Consequently, examiners will assess whether senior management ensures that the compliance program has sufficient financial resources and a sufficient number of qualified and well-trained staff to carry out its responsibilities effectively.Policies and ProceduresPolicies and procedures essentially define and communicate the key goals and processes of an organization\\'s compliance program. Examiners will look to see whether policies and procedures provide for adequate risk identification, assessment, measurement, and control.As I mentioned a few moments ago, clearly communicated roles and responsibilities are a characteristic of an effective compliance program. Toward that end, examiners will also look to determine whether policies clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the organization\\'s activities.Examiners also expect to see a well-defined process for ensuring that when compliance risks or potential breaches are identified they are elevated to the appropriate level, in keeping with the risk to the organization. Procedures for doing so should be well-communicated to staff throughout the organization.Overall, policies and procedures must be kept current, and, as with the risk assessment, examiners will look to see whether information gleaned from the compliance program operations is used to further tailor compliance policies, procedures, and controls to specifically address the inherent environment as it evolves.Internal ControlsInternal controls are a particularly crucial element of a compliance-risk management program. Examiners will verify whether the organization has established and implemented an effective system of internal controls, including appropriate reporting lines and separation of duties, as well as positive and negative incentives.An essential part of the internal control framework is periodic testing to determine how well the framework is operating, so that any required remedial actions can be taken. The frequency of testing should be risk-based and should involve, as appropriate, sample transaction testing, the sample size being determined by volume and the degree of risk of the activity.Examiners will carefully assess the scope and quality of the testing of the compliance program. Part of this assessment will include determining whether the testing was performed with appropriate independence. Examiners will also look to understand the specific delineations of responsibilities between the internal audit, compliance, and other independent functions or third parties. These delineations will vary by organization, but all roles should be clearly defined and communicated.Examiners will also look at how well compliance-testing exceptions are reported to senior management and resolved by business-line management. They will assess methods for tracking exceptions until the exceptions are resolved; this assessment will include examining the organization\\'s provisions for escalating unresolved exceptions to higher levels in the organization, including the board of directors.Independence and separation of duties are also issues of importance beyond compliance testing. For example, in the case of large complex banking organizations that may have a corporate compliance function, examiners will be interested in understanding how the compliance function maintains its independence from the business lines it advises on compliance requirements and the implementation of required controls. In cases in which the compliance function has responsibility for monitoring and testing, examiners will assess whether procedures are established to ensure an adequate degree of independence and objectivity.Monitoring and ReportingAs I mentioned, the fundamental purpose of compliance-risk management programs is to identify, monitor, and manage compliance risk more effectively. Monitoring involves identifying and communicating compliance concerns to the appropriate parties within the organization. Monitoring and reporting enable senior management and the board to effectively carry out their respective responsibilities. We have seen organizations silo critical compliance information rather than share it with all levels of the organization, which can handicap an organization\\'s ability to identify systemic risks. As a result, examiners are interested in whether a compliance program is designed to monitor and report compliance concerns.The level of sophistication of banking organizations\\' monitoring activities generally varies according to the size and complexity of the organization, and examiners\\' expectations will vary accordingly. For example, large complex banking organizations are typically supported by information systems that provide management with timely reports related to compliance with laws and regulations at the transaction level. Examiners will look to see whether these reports generally address monitoring and testing activities, actual or potential material compliance deficiencies or breaches, and new or changing compliance requirements. They will also assess whether reports are designed to ensure that information on compliance is communicated to the appropriate levels within the organization.TrainingTraining on policies, procedures, and associated controls is a component of compliance-risk management that should not be overlooked. Examiners will determine whether the banking organization\\'s training program ensures that compliance policies, procedures, and controls are well understood and appropriately communicated throughout the organization.While the depth and breadth of training that an employee receives depends on that employee\\'s role and responsibilities, examiners generally assess whether staff at all levels understand the organization\\'s compliance culture, general compliance-risk issues, and high-level compliance policies and procedures.Supervisory Consistency and the Bank Secrecy ActAs banking organizations become more complex, consistency in the agencies\\' supervisory approach has become even more critical. The Federal Reserve views supervisory consistency as a means of enhancing supervision and reducing burden. This is particularly essential in the area of regulatory compliance, and specifically with regard to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and its regulations.The Federal Reserve includes a review of BSA compliance within every full-scope safety-and-soundness examination. For larger banking organizations that are subject to continuous supervision, the Federal Reserve conducts a series of targeted BSA reviews over the course of the supervisory cycle. This, combined with off-site monitoring, allows the Federal Reserve to maintain a current understanding of BSA compliance within the organizations that are subject to its supervision. On-site examinations are essential to ensure that the BSA program is operating effectively.The agencies are currently updating the manual and plan to release the revised version this summer. I have been told that the revised manual will include not only updates reflecting changes in regulations and supervisory guidance over the course of the past year, but also, among other things, additional guidance on developing a BSA/AML risk assessment, which is the foundation of effective risk-based controls.HMDA Data and Fair Lending ExaminationsExaminations to evaluate a banking organization\\'s adherence to fair lending laws and regulations are also a routine component of consumer compliance examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve. HMDA data play an important role in examinations of those banking organizations that are required to report the data. Examiners probe that data to understand how the bank is responding to credit needs and serving its community. The data are rich in many respects. They contain information about applicants\\' and borrowers\\' race or ethnicity, sex, income level, and property location. And, since 2004, the HMDA data have also included price information about certain loans with prices that exceed thresholds set by the Board.The HMDA data help examiners better focus the fair lending examination. Particularly for banks with larger portfolios, the data, including any available pricing data, are incorporated into statistical management systems that analyze lending patterns and help direct the examination process to aspects of the bank\\'s program that may warrant a closer look. Even in smaller banks where a statistical analysis cannot be performed, the HMDA data can be used to start the fair lending review. However, as we know, HMDA data have limitations. For example, the data do not include credit-risk factors such as credit scores and loan-to-value ratios. Because of these limitations, the examination process looks at additional information about a lender\\'s practices, and about particular loans, before any conclusions are drawn. Examiners consider--together with HMDA data--information derived from consumer complaints, risks apparent from various business lines, and the adequacy of the institution\\'s compliance-risk management program.Since examiners will be looking at the data, it would be advisable for a bank to make a review of the data a component of a comprehensive fair lending compliance program and Community Reinvestment Act strategy. In fact, examiners will look carefully at analyses of HMDA data performed by a bank and talk with the bank to understand the reasons for any disparities in lending patterns. The bank is probably in the best position to understand what the HMDA data suggest about its ability to reach prospective borrowers. Consequently, its own assessment is useful to an examiner establishing the fair lending examination scope. Examiners want to know how banks have addressed any disparities and how the bank\\'s analysis has led to any changes in controls that were made to ensure that policies are followed. I want to emphasize that, as with compliance-risk management programs, the breadth of a banking organization\\'s program and system review should be commensurate with the size and complexity of its operations, the range of its products, and the demographics of its markets.Beyond this review of HMDA data, examiners evaluate whether an organization\\'s fair lending compliance framework makes it possible to identify, monitor, and effectively control risks. Examiners are looking for a clear articulation by the board of directors of the institution\\'s lending strategy, including defined risk parameters and the execution of appropriate risk-measurement and risk-mitigation initiatives. Examiners will evaluate the extent to which management controls reflect the risk associated with the institution\\'s lending strategy.As with the broader area of compliance-risk management, examiners will look closely at how the compliance culture established at the top of the organization filters down into the everyday responsibilities of business-line managers and how those managers are held accountable for compliance.ConclusionBecause of the growing complexity of banking organizations, the Federal Reserve is currently considering whether more-tailored guidance in the area of enterprise-wide compliance-risk management is warranted. In the coming months, we will continue to engage with you to better understand your successful approaches to identifying, monitoring, and managing risk across your organizations.Thank you. I am pleased to be here to discuss some strategies for helping families, particularly lower-income families, improve their economic and financial well-being. Families today face a financial marketplace that is increasingly complex, with numerous products and service providers from which to choose. Today I will touch on several approaches for helping people of modest means take advantage of these financial opportunities while managing the risks and avoiding possible pitfalls.Today’s Financial Marketplace Technological advances have dramatically transformed the provision of financial products and services in recent years. To cite just one example, the expanded use of computerized credit-scoring models, by reducing the costs of making loans and by increasing the range of assets that lenders can sell on the secondary market, has made possible the extension of credit to a larger group of borrowers. Indeed, we have seen an increasingly wide array of products being offered to consumers across a range of incomes, leading to what has been called the democratization of credit. Likewise, technological innovation has enhanced financial services, such as banking services, and increased the variety of financial products available to savers.Financial Challenges of Lower-Income FamiliesDespite the increased complexity of financial products and the wider availability of credit in many forms, U.S. households overall have been managing their personal finances well. On average, debt burdens appear to be at manageable levels, and delinquency rates on consumer loans and home mortgages have been low. Measured relative to disposable income, household net worth is at a fairly high level, although still below the peak reached earlier this decade.The Survey also found that lower-income households are less able than others to manage their debts. A greater fraction of these households had debt-to-income ratios of 40 percent or more or had a payment past due at least sixty days. The data also reveal that only 40 percent of families in the lowest quintile own a home, compared with a homeownership rate of 69 percent among all families surveyed. Finally, the data on retirement account ownership show an even larger gap, with only 10 percent of lowest-quintile families holding a retirement account, whereas 50 percent of all families responding to the survey reported participation in some type of retirement savings plan.How can these disparities be addressed? Some general approaches to helping families of modest means build assets and improve their economic well-being include community economic development, financial education, and programs that encourage saving and investment. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss each of these approaches briefly and offer some insights into their effectiveness based on research and experience.Community Economic Development In my time with the Federal Reserve, I have had a number of opportunities to meet with community economic development leaders--representatives of groups working to assist lower-income families become homeowners, start small businesses, better manage their finances, and save for the future. In fact, my first trip as a Federal Reserve Board member was to Brownsville, Texas, where I saw how a grassroots nonprofit organization is helping to build communities and to provide residents with the chance to build wealth through homeownership. The Community Development Corporation (CDC) of Brownsville works with multiple funding partners--governments at all levels, financial institutions, foundations, and corporations--to construct housing and to design innovative loan products that enable low-income families to qualify for mortgage credit. For example, because of the mix of funding sources, mortgage loans can be offered with features such as down‑payment assistance or a below-market interest rate. The CDC of Brownsville also offers a program that allows prospective homeowners to acquire \"sweat equity\" in a property by working on construction teams to help build their own new home and those of other participating families.As in the case of many community development organizations, the Brownsville CDC has also made financial education a critical element of its efforts to help lower-income residents improve their financial status. For example, participation in financial counseling or in an education program is typically required for a borrower to obtain a loan through the CDC or through one of its lending partners. However, the broader aim of these programs is to improve borrowers’ prospects for longer-term success in maintaining their credit and handling their overall finances. Since 1994, through this combination of leveraged financing arrangements and borrower education, the CDC of Brownsville has helped make homeownership possible for more than 2,500 low-income families. I cite the Brownsville example because of the opportunity that I had to learn about their work (and I recently had a similar opportunity to see some impressive community development efforts in the Anacostia neighborhood of the District of Columbia). But this localized approach to community development and wealth-building is playing out in neighborhoods throughout the country, in most cases through strategies tailored to the distinct needs of the particular community.Financial Education and Financial LiteracyFinancial education has not only been integral to community development but has also begun to play a larger role in the broader consumer market. Clearly, to choose wisely from the wide variety of financial products and providers available, consumers must have at least basic financial knowledge. People who understand the financial aspects of purchasing a home or starting a business, or who appreciate the importance of saving for children’s education or retirement, will almost certainly be economically better off than those without that vital information. Financial literacy can be acquired through many channels: in school, on the job, through community programs and counseling, or through self-education and experience.Studies that establish an association between financial knowledge and good financial outcomes are encouraging, but they do not necessarily prove that financial training and counseling are the causes of the better outcomes. It could be, for example, that counseling is associated with better financial outcomes because the consumers who choose to seek counseling are the ones who are already better informed or more motivated to make good financial decisions. In medicine and other fields, researchers gain a better understanding of what causes what by doing controlled studies, in which some subjects are randomly assigned a particular treatment while others do not receive it. To translate this idea to the analysis of the effects of financial counseling, the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs is collaborating with the Department of Defense to conduct a three-year study of the effects of financial education. This study will evaluate the impact of various educational programs on the financial decisions of soldiers and their families. It includes a treatment group of those receiving financial education, with the programs each family receives and when they receive it being determined randomly, and a control group of similar soldiers and their families who have not received this formal financial education. Because assignments of individuals to programs will be random, any observed changes in behavior can be more reliably attributed to the type and amount of counseling received. Among other things, the results of this study should help us better understand whether financial education leads to changes in behavior for participants in general or only for those at critical teaching moments, such as the period before making a major financial decision such as choosing a mortgage.I would like to say just a few words about the Federal Reserve’s broader role in promoting consumers’ understanding of financial products and services. Beyond conducting surveys of consumers and doing research, we work in a number of ways to support consumers in their financial decisionmaking. For example, through our consumer protection rule-writing authority, the Federal Reserve sets requirements that specify the information that must be disclosed to consumers about the terms and fees associated with credit and deposit accounts. These disclosures provide consumers with the essential information they need to assess the costs and benefits of financial services and compare products among different providers. We are currently reviewing many of our disclosures and plan to use focus groups and other methods to try to make these disclosures as clear and as user-friendly as possible.These insights into consumer behavior have prompted some changes in the design of retirement plans and in education programs focused on saving for retirement. More employers now feature automatic enrollment in their 401(k) plans in an effort to boost participation. Also, some have set the default investment option to a diversified portfolio that is rebalanced automatically as the worker ages or have set contribution rates to rise automatically over time in line with salary increases.However, although these changes in program design may boost saving and improve investment choices, they are not a substitute for continued financial education. Employers, including the Federal Reserve Board, offer financial education at the workplace to help their workers gain a better understanding of retirement savings options. Helping people appreciate the importance of saving and giving them the tools they need to translate that knowledge into action remain major challenges.ConclusionLet me close by observing that many factors influence consumer financial behavior. Financial education is clearly central to helping consumers make better decisions for themselves and their families, but policymakers, regulators, nonprofit organizations, and financial service providers must all help ensure that consumers have the tools and the information they need to make better decisions. Success can only come through collaborative efforts. I see much interest today in increased collaboration toward these objectives, both in Washington and around the country.Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I encourage you to continue working together to help provide increased economic opportunity in your communities, and I wish you the best of luck in your efforts.Footnotes Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here today, and I thank you for the invitation. It almost goes without saying that over the past several years, residential housing markets have been attracting considerable attention, and they have been a strong contributor to the overall growth of the U.S. economy. Today I would like to offer some thoughts on the current state of both residential and commercial mortgage markets and then discuss some ways in which U.S. bank supervisors are trying to ensure that bank lending in those markets is safe and sound.Conditions in Real Estate MarketsResidential Real Estate MarketsActivity in U.S. housing markets is slowing. Incoming data point to a decided, but so far moderate, cooling. Starts of single-family houses fell appreciably in March and April. Because construction had been spurred in the preceding months by unusually mild weather, some slowing in the spring was natural. However, the level of housing starts lately has fallen below not just the elevated winter pace but also the pace of last fall. Indeed, construction permit issuance for single-family homes, which is less affected by the weather, has been declining since September. Sales of new and existing homes have dropped noticeably from their highs of last year. In addition, inventories of unsold homes have increased, and your own MBA index of loan applications for home purchases has trended lower in recent months.Although a slowdown in housing activity is apparent in a wide range of indicators, it seems to be occurring in a gradual way. Notwithstanding their recent slip, both home construction and home sales are still at relatively high levels. The underlying fundamentals of housing demand also remain favorable. Real disposable income is growing at a solid pace. In the aggregate, household balance sheets appear to be in a good position, even though risks clearly exist for some households. Long-term mortgage rates, although up substantially from last summer\\'s level, remain low relative to their historical experience.The latest data on house prices from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight suggest that house-price appreciation has moderated but that prices in the aggregate continue to move up. Between the first quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of this year, the price index for existing homes sold in repeat transactions increased 10 percent--a solid gain but down a bit from the record pace for the period mid-2004 to mid-2005. Focusing on the first quarter of 2006 alone, prices increased at an annual rate of 7.3 percent. However, quarterly figures should be treated with a good degree of caution given the volatility of this data series.Given the slowing conditions in the housing market, spending for the construction of new housing is unlikely to be an important direct source of overall GDP growth this year, after having contributed close to ½ percentage point last year. In addition, the slackening of house-price appreciation could hold back growth in consumption spending through the so-called wealth effect, or the effect that lower overall housing wealth has on consumption. Estimates from various econometric models of consumer spending suggest that each dollar of change in wealth is associated with a change in consumption of approximately 3½ cents, with roughly half of the effect occurring within a year.Of course, these consumption estimates are just that--estimates. Beyond the usual issues of measurement and interpretation associated with any statistical estimate, one can easily point to some specific risks in estimating how housing wealth affects spending. First, econometric modeling has had difficulty distinguishing between the effects of movements in housing wealth and movements in other components of household balance sheets, even though housing may be a unique asset in a number of ways. Thus, the estimate of change in consumption that I cited is based on the historical relationship between spending and changes in overall wealth. Changes in housing wealth may have a somewhat different effect. Second, the linkages between housing wealth and consumption may change over time. For example, these linkages may be stronger now than in the past because financial innovation has made it easier and less costly for households to tap their accumulated housing equity. Third, a pronounced deceleration in house prices could have an outsized effect on consumer confidence, and such a decline in confidence could be an additional damping force on consumption.Another housing-related issue that bears watching is mortgage debt accumulation. Since the end of 2002, home mortgage debt outstanding has risen about 50 percent. The increase has substantially pushed up homeowners\\' mortgage payments in relation to their income, in spite of historically low mortgage rates, the growing use of interest-only mortgages, and the lengthening of average loan maturities over the past few years. That said, homeowners appear to be able to manage these higher payments: we have seen only a little deterioration in mortgage credit quality as yet, and overall delinquency rates remain low. Going forward, I expect aggregate homeowner mortgage payments to continue to rise, especially as adjustable-rate mortgages reach their initial reset dates. However, these reset adjustments are expected to be gradual, and only a modest number of outstanding mortgages are expected to reset during 2006 and 2007. To date, consumers appear to be managing changes in their mortgage payments quite well.One area of potential concern relates to the portion of home sales accounted for by investors, as opposed to owner-occupants. Historically, only around 5 percent of U.S. homes were purchased each year by investors; in 2005, it appears that figure was considerably higher. In many cases, investors purchased homes because they believed prices were going to rise further, not necessarily because they wanted to retain the property over time for rental income. As prices level off or even decline, it will be important to see whether this investor activity subsides significantly, and if so, the impact on mortgage markets more broadly.Commercial Real Estate MarketsIn addition to monitoring residential markets, the Federal Reserve keeps a close watch on developments in commercial real estate markets. Overall, conditions in this sector appear to be improving. Demand for commercial space has been growing moderately, while the construction of new space has generally remained tame, restrained in part by steep land prices and high construction costs. The result has been a widespread decline in vacancy rates over the past few years. Reflecting this improved balance between demand and supply, rents on commercial properties have been increasing after a prolonged period of softness.Although the level of commercial construction remains well below its peak in 2000, the latest data indicate what may be the beginning of a pickup. Census Bureau data on nonresidential construction put in place suggest that real spending rose in April for the sixth consecutive month. Leading indicators of commercial construction spending, such as billings by architectural firms for design work, point to further increases in activity in coming months. An upturn in commercial construction could offset part of what is anticipated to be a waning contribution to GDP growth from the housing sector.The performance of commercial real estate loans has generally been very good, due in large part to the low interest rates of recent years and the substantial appreciation of property values that has resulted in sizable equity positions for building owners. Delinquency rates on loans held by commercial banks and life insurance companies remain low by historical standards, and delinquencies on commercial mortgage-backed securities have reversed the modest increase that occurred from 2000 to 2003. The latest information on property prices hints at some moderation in price increases in the first quarter from the rapid price appreciation of last year. But, as in the housing market, commercial real estate prices are continuing to rise in the aggregate.Recent Supervisory Guidance Relating to Real Estate LendingThe Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments in the residential and commercial real estate markets very closely. In addition to scrutinizing the effect of these developments on the economy, we are also, in our role as bank supervisors, monitoring banks\\' mortgage lending practices. Last year, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued draft guidance on both residential and commercial mortgage lending. The agencies have received many comments on the proposed guidance, including comments from your association, which we will consider as we discuss what steps to take next. I will address the guidance on residential mortgage lending first.Nontraditional Mortgage ProductsOver the past few years, the agencies have observed an increase in the number of residential mortgage loans that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and, sometimes, interest. These loans, often referred to as nontraditional mortgage loans, include interest-only (IO) mortgage loans, for which the borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years of the loan, and payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), for which the borrower has flexible payment options--and which could result in negative amortization.IOs and option ARMs are estimated to have accounted for almost one-third of all U.S. mortgage originations in 2005, compared with fewer than 10 percent in 2003. Despite their recent growth, however, it is estimated that these products still account for less than 20 percent of aggregate domestic mortgages outstanding of nearly $9 trillion. Although the credit quality of residential mortgages generally remains strong, the Federal Reserve and the other banking supervisors are concerned that banks\\' current risk-management techniques may not fully address the level of risk inherent in nontraditional mortgages, a risk that would be heightened by a downturn in the housing market.Mortgages with some of the characteristics of nontraditional mortgage products have been available for many years; however, they have historically been offered to higher-income borrowers. More recently, nontraditional mortgages have been offered to a wider spectrum of consumers, including subprime borrowers, who may be less suited for these types of mortgages and may not fully recognize their embedded risks. These borrowers are more likely to experience an unmanageable payment shock during the life of the loan, meaning that they may be more likely to default on the loan. Further, nontraditional mortgage loans are becoming more prevalent in the subprime market at the same time risk tolerances in the capital markets have increased. Banks need to be prepared for the resulting impact on liquidity and pricing if and when risk spreads return to more \"normal\" levels and competition in the mortgage banking industry intensifies.Supervisors have also observed that lenders are increasingly combining nontraditional mortgage loans with weaker mitigating controls on credit exposures--for example, by accepting less documentation in evaluating an applicant\\'s creditworthiness and not evaluating the borrower\\'s ability to meet increasing monthly payments when amortization begins or when interest rates rise. These \"risk layering\" practices have become more and more prevalent in mortgage originations. Thus, although some banks may have used some elements of nontraditional mortgage products successfully in the past, the recent easing of traditional underwriting controls and the sale of nontraditional products to subprime borrowers may contribute to losses on these products.Supervisors are concerned that banks may not be fully aware of the potential risks of using risk-layering practices with nontraditional mortgage products. These practices may have become more widespread over the past couple of years as competition for borrowers and declining profit margins may have forced lenders to loosen their credit standards to maintain their loan volume. In the Federal Reserve Board\\'s most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey, conducted this past April, more than 10 percent of the surveyed institutions reported having eased their underwriting standards for residential mortgage loans. Only one of the surveyed lenders reported having tightened standards. Additionally, information from other sources seems to show continued growth in the number of borrowers purchasing real estate with no equity using simultaneous second liens.Naturally, we are watching for any signs that defaults may be on the rise. Some industry evidence indicates that delinquencies may be on the uptick; delinquency rates for loans issued in 2005 are, in most cases, higher than those for comparable loans issued in earlier years. Some industry observers believe that the increase in delinquencies for loans issued in 2005 is directly related to the continued easing of underwriting standards and the increased use of risk-layering practices.The industry trends I have just described, taken together, were the justification for the issuance of draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products by the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies. The proposed guidance emphasizes that an institution\\'s risk-management processes should allow it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products. It reminds lenders of the importance of assessing a borrower\\'s ability to repay the loan, both now and when amortization begins and interest rates rise. Nontraditional mortgage products warrant a bank having strong risk-management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan-loss reserves. Further, bankers should consider the impact of prepayment penalties for ARMs. Lenders should provide enough information so that borrowers clearly understand, before choosing a product or payment option, the terms of and risks associated with these loans, particularly the extent to which monthly payments may rise and negative amortization may increase the amount owed above the amount originally borrowed. Lenders should recognize that certain nontraditional mortgage loans are untested in a stressed environment; for instance, nontraditional mortgage loans to investors that rely on collateral values could be particularly affected by a housing-price decline. As noted, investors have represented an unusually large share of recent home purchases. Past loan performance has indicated that investors are more likely than owner-occupants to default on a loan when housing prices decline.When credit standards are eased and risks are layered, institutions should compensate for the increased risk with mitigating factors that support the underwriting decision. Among other credit enhancements, these factors generally include requiring borrowers to have higher credit scores, lower loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, and significant liquidity and net worth. Finally, lenders should establish appropriate allowances for estimated credit losses in their nontraditional mortgage portfolios and hold capital commensurate with the risk characteristics inherent in these products.One final subject that is not addressed explicitly in our draft guidance, but that I believe is still important to supervisors and bankers, is mortgage fraud. There appears to have been a substantial upswing in suspected fraud related to residential mortgages in the past decade. Types of fraud include falsification of loan applications, identity theft, misuse of loan proceeds, and inflated appraisals. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, there were more than 18,000 reports of suspected mortgage fraud in 2004 (the latest year for which we have complete data), compared with fewer than 2,000 reports in 1997. And in the first six months of 2005 alone, there were more than 11,000 reports of suspected mortgage fraud. The increase may be attributable in part to an increase in the number of originators required to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Notably, the more widespread use of nontraditional loan products may present greater opportunity for fraud, as these products sometimes lack some of the quality checks typical of more-traditional mortgages. In general, we consider mortgage fraud to be a serious issue and one that bankers and supervisors must continue to confront. Of course, supervisors want to hear the industry\\'s perspective on fraud in mortgage lending.Commercial Real EstateThe U.S. banking agencies recently issued proposed guidance on commercial real estate (CRE) lending. A major portion of that guidance focuses on CRE concentrations.Before I discuss the importance of managing CRE concentrations, I want to emphasize that the proposed CRE guidance relates to \"true\" CRE loans. It is not directed at commercial loans for which a bank looks to a business\\'s cash flow as the source of repayment and accepts real estate collateral as a secondary source of repayment. The proposed guidance addresses bank loans for commercial real estate projects for which repayment depends on third-party rental income or on the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The latter are \"true\" commercial real estate loans, in that repayment depends on the condition and performance of the real estate market.I also want to mention up front that the proposed guidance is not intended to cap or restrict banks\\' participation in the CRE sector but rather to remind institutions that proper risk management and appropriate capital are essential elements of a sound CRE lending strategy. In fact, many institutions already have both of these elements in place and may not need to adjust their practices very much.I believe we are all aware of the central role that CRE lending played in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s. One reason supervisors are proposing CRE guidance at this point is that we are seeing high and rising concentrations of CRE loans relative to capital. For certain groups of banks, such as those with assets of between $100 million and $1 billion, the average CRE concentration level is about 300 percent of total capital. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the concentration level for this same bank group was about 150 percent, or half the current level. Therefore, banks should not be surprised by the emphasis in the proposed CRE guidance on concentrations and the importance of portfolio risk management.Historically, CRE has been a highly volatile asset class. In the past, problems in CRE, even at well-managed banks, have generally come at times when the broader market was encountering difficulties. In an effort to generate cash flow, borrowers and bankers with properties in distress may disrupt their local real estate market by cutting rents or offering leasehold improvements and other incentives to attract or keep tenants. These actions can have a negative effect on the entire local real estate market, including good projects. In most years, CRE credit losses are relatively low compared with many other types of bank loans. But in times of stress, the loss rate can jump considerably higher. Because CRE losses tend to be greater during times of stress, bankers must focus more intently on their risk appetite as their CRE concentration grows. Bankers must consider how much capital will be placed at risk if the CRE portfolio hits a stress period and compare that loss exposure with the relative returns of CRE lending. In other words, bankers need to practice risk management.While banks\\' underwriting standards are generally stronger than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, the agencies are proposing the guidance now to reinforce sound portfolio-management principles that a bank should have in place when pursuing a commercial real estate lending strategy. A bank should be monitoring performance both on an individual-loan basis as well as on a collective basis for loans collateralized by similar property types or in the same markets.Some institutions\\' strategic- and capital-planning processes may not adequately acknowledge the risks from their CRE concentrations. CRE lending in recent years has occurred under fairly benign credit conditions, but those conditions are unlikely to continue indefinitely. The ability of banks with significant concentrations to weather difficult market conditions will depend heavily on their risk-management processes and their level of capitalization. From a risk-management and capital perspective, institutions should generally focus on the emerging conditions in their real estate markets and on the potential cumulative impact on their portfolios if conditions deteriorate; they should also take other measures to help identify CRE vulnerabilities. Of course, these measures should vary according to the size of the organization and the level of the concentration. All of these steps are key elements of a sound strategy to manage concentrations.While supervisors continue to underscore the importance of having robust risk-management practices for CRE and other lending concentrations, we do acknowledge that banks may pursue a variety of approaches. In some cases, such as when there is not enough market data available or the relevant geographic market is small, banks may have to turn to less- quantitative approaches. Nonetheless, those approaches should be robust, well documented, and transparent. This is consistent with the broader theme that risk management should be scaled to the institution. Along those same lines, we are not necessarily expecting smaller banks to be able to conduct regular, extensive, and sophisticated quantitative stress tests around their lending concentrations. However, we do want bankers at smaller organizations to have clear and coherent methods for evaluating the various potential outcomes associated with their CRE concentrations and with all their exposures more broadly.ConclusionIn the past several decades, real estate markets, both residential and commercial, have affected the U.S. economy in both negative and positive ways. Naturally, the Federal Reserve monitors these markets to gauge their impact on broader economic activity. In addition, because banks are substantially involved in both residential and commercial real estate markets, as a supervisor, we must ensure that bank lending in these markets is conducted in a safe and sound manner.One tool we use to help maintain the safety and soundness of banks is supervisory guidance, which can point out areas requiring additional monitoring, suggest ways in which banks can improve risk management, and remind bankers that they should continue to exercise discipline in their lending activities to ensure that they are accounting for all their risks. The recently issued draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products and on CRE lending, as I have noted, is not an attempt to stifle lending in these sectors, which, if conducted properly, can continue to be profitable businesses for bankers. Indeed, we recognize the important role that banks play in real estate lending. That is why we want to ensure that banks maintain good practices when operating in those markets.As a final point, if both sets of guidance are finalized, we aim to implement them as consistently as possible across institutions. We do understand bankers\\' concerns about this issue. Of course, it is always a challenge to ensure that there is consistent application of guidance throughout the industry, especially when bank-specific factors--such as portfolio concentrations and individual risk-management practices--might affect the manner in which the guidance needs to be applied to each bank. But if the guidance is indeed finalized, we plan to undertake considerable efforts across our agencies, including extensive communication and coordination, so that banks are not subject to needlessly differing treatment. Governor Randall S. Kroszner presented identical remarks at the Institute of International Bankers, New York, New York, on June 16, 2006Today I want to talk about some new and exciting developments in bond markets around the world. The motivation for my discussion is the current puzzling situation of a relatively flat yield curve combined with relatively low real and nominal long-term interest rates, which has occurred both in developed economies and in emerging markets. I will explore some possible explanations for the pattern and will focus on changes in the prospects for and risks to the long-term inflation outlook, particularly in emerging-market economies. In particular, I will highlight how financial innovations and international competitive pressures, combined with a better public understanding of the costs of inflation and changes in the institutions of central banking, have helped improve the credibility of central banks and inflation outcomes in many emerging markets.Until recently, many emerging-market countries simply did not have a yield curve because there was effectively no market for debt issued in domestic currency beyond a very short horizon. The credibility of central banks has been crucial to this deepening of the domestic capital market, which is typically associated with higher economic growth.I am optimistic that these developments will continue, as I believe that the move toward low inflation rates reflects important technological and institutional factors that are likely to persist. Nevertheless, there are still risks, which underscore the importance of continuing to reap the benefits of improved central bank behavior and credibility in emerging markets and around the world.The combination of a rising short rate and a relatively stable long rate has led to a very flat yield curve. During the last quarter-century, for example, the difference between the yield on the ten-year Treasury note and the yield on the three-month Treasury bill has been roughly 1-3/4 percent (or, to be exact, 179 basis points from 1980 to the present). During the last year, that difference has been less than 50 basis points and is currently less than half of that. Thus, this essentially flat slope is atypical in U.S. experience.The U.S. bond market conundrum has occurred in parallel with similar developments in foreign bond markets. In major industrial countries, bond yields have trended down, in some cases reaching historical lows recently. Yields are also low in real terms, as measured by inflation-indexed bonds. Far-forward short rates in recent years have also reached unusually low levels in many industrial countries.The most interesting and, I believe, perhaps least studied recent developments in the bond markets concern the changes in emerging markets. While it is well known that the yield spreads on dollar-denominated bonds of emerging-market governments included in the EMBI+ index are near all time lows (even taking into account the recent rise), two phenomena in emerging markets have received less attention.One is the development of markets for longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in local currencies. This phenomenon is, from my perspective, quite remarkable and belies the assertion that the \"original sins\" of bad policy from the past have doomed the development of domestic currency bond markets in many emerging markets. The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt markets has, in many cases, not only extended a yield curve but effectively created a local currency yield curve that simply did not exist earlier.Since 2000, ten-year nominal fixed-coupon bonds in local currency have been introduced in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia, while Korea issued a ten-year fixed coupon bond in 1995. To illustrate in more detail, the governments of Mexico and Korea have been able extend the average maturity of their local-currency debt significantly in just the past few years. The Mexican government issued ten-year maturities in 2001 and then 20-year maturities in 2003. The proportion of local-currency debt in Mexico maturing within one year was nearly 90 percent in 2002 and is now below 75 percent. (I have included floating rate debt in the one-year maturity category.) The Korean government continues to increase the proportion of its domestic currency debt in longer maturities, with the one-year-and-under segment falling from roughly one-half in 1999 to one-quarter by the end of last year.Two, bond yields in local currencies of emerging-market countries have also declined. It is perhaps not surprising that, given their high rates of saving and generally high level of economic development, the governments of Hong Kong and Korea can borrow at close to industrial-country levels. More notable, however, is that the Mexican government can borrow in pesos at a ten-year maturity at rates that have averaged roughly 9 percent. And Mexico is not unique in this regard. Other middle-income emerging markets with ten-year local-currency fixed rate bond yields in the single digits include Chile, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand, to name but a few. For countries with longer maturities, implied short-term interest rates five years ahead also have been declining and have reached very low levels, although there have been some increases in the past few months.What is driving these changes? There are a number of complementary, not alternative, explanations.However, there is also a nominal aspect of low global bond yields. In the rest of my talk, I would like to emphasize the worldwide decline of inflation and perceived inflation risk as a key contributor to low nominal bond yields.Explanations for the Low Nominal Bond Yields\\xa0\\n       Inflation rates in major industrial and developing regions have trended down over the past twenty-five years. Compared with the period 1980 to 1999, median inflation rates from 2000 to 2004 fell from 5 percent to 2 percent in industrialized countries and from 14 percent to 4-1/2 percent in emerging markets, according to the most recent statistics from the International Monetary Fund. Not long ago, annual inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico at times exceeded 100 percent. But during the past decade, Brazilian and Mexican inflation rates have remained low. In particular, inflation in Brazil did not spike up after its financial crises and sharp currency depreciations in the late 1990s. Given Brazil’s history of hyperinflation, this stability is especially remarkable. Brazil did experience a small spike of inflation around its presidential election in 2002, but even this was minor by historical standards. The pattern of low inflation is seen across many countries, large and small.Do markets expect low inflation to persist in the long run? To answer this question, we can look at measures of expected inflation. Consensus Economics surveys hundreds of professional forecasters in numerous countries each April. The surveys allow us to examine forecasts of inflation around the world six to ten years ahead beginning in 1996. The latest observation, in April 2006, for example, is the forecast of a given country’s average consumer price inflation rate from 2012 through 2016. For both a representative sample of industrial economies (Euro area, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) and emerging-market economies (Brazil, China, Korea, and Mexico), we observe substantial declines from the late 1990s to today. These forecasts have been low and stable in both industrial and many important developing countries in recent years. The surveys thus provide one indication that markets do expect low inflation to persist.The volatility of inflation has also declined notably, suggesting that perceived inflation risk may have declined as well. For the industrial countries, inflation volatility (measured as a twenty-quarter rolling standard deviation of consumer price inflation) has declined from the 1980s to the 1990s to the period since 2000. Although it has since drifted up just a bit due to volatility in oil prices, it remains at or near its lowest level in the last quarter-century. For the emerging markets, the decline in volatility is even more dramatic. Brazil, in particular, was off the chart much of the time before the late 1990s. Volatility of inflation in China, Korea, and Mexico is now at levels similar to those of the industrial countries, and volatility in Brazil is not much higher.Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation around the world has led to a reduction in inflation expectations and lower perceived inflation risk, hence a lower inflation uncertainty premium in long rates. I believe that these factors have been important contributors to the lower long-term yields and the flattening of yield curves, particularly in emerging markets. The existence of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.Factors Behind the Global Move to Price Stability\\n       Four broad factors lie behind the move to price stability, especially in emerging markets, and these factors tend to reinforce each other. Each factor affects the cost-benefit tradeoff of pursuing a high-inflation policy.Given these innovations, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit for each unit increase in inflation because people can more easily switch out of the local currency. In other words, the inflation tax becomes much more difficult and costly to levy because citizens can more easily avoid the tax by using an alternative money.The second and closely related factor behind disinflation is deregulation and competition in a globalized marketplace. The collapse of the centrally-planned economies has led many countries to turn increasingly to private markets to deliver growth and progress and reduce the role of government. Technology has helped to increase global competition by shrinking the barriers of time and distance. Again, there are several channels by which globalization and competition may have affected the cost-benefit tradeoff in pursing inflation:The fourth factor I wish to mention relates to changes in the institutions of central banking that may have increased the costs of pursuing high-inflation policies. The most notable change is the increased independence of many central banks and the corresponding reduced control of the fiscal authorities over monetary policy. Central bank independence reduces the ability of a government to \"raid the cookie jar\" through a surprise inflation tax. In most cases, central bank independence can be reversed by a majority vote of parliament. But having to resort to such a vote is a greater obstacle to inflationary finance than previous arrangements allowed, especially given the public’s increased sensitivity and aversion to inflation.Central bank independence has typically been granted in conjunction with an explicit mandate that makes achieving low and stable inflation one of the goals of monetary policy. Central bank independence with a mandate that includes price stability increases the credibility of monetary policy with regard to achieving low inflation. Policy is credible because the central bank’s objectives are clear to the public and the central bank can be held accountable for failing to achieve its objectives.Benefits of Price Stability\\n       While it is well known that low and stable inflation improves the environment for investment planning and avoids many costs and disruptions associated with frequent price adjustments, I want to focus on a few of the many benefits that are particularly relevant for emerging markets.The development of long-term local-currency bond markets may also help governments and firms plan long-term infrastructure and investment projects that boost economic development. Although such debt markets are only one of many factors that can lower the costs of long-term planning and enhance the ability to undertake long-term investments, the development of these markets, particularly when accompanied by lower real rates, help to support longer-horizon projects and reduce the effect of foreign exchange movements on such activities.A better fiscal outlook, which might arise from higher and more stable growth as well as better long-term planning, also increases financial market confidence and development and thus further boosts growth and reinforces prospects for continued price stability. This virtuous cycle appears to be happening in key emerging markets that were long plagued with poor fiscal situations, such as Brazil and Mexico. In the 1980s and early 1990s, for example, public sector deficits in these countries often exceeded 10 percent of GDP. Since the late 1990s, deficits have been diminished.Maintaining this Progress\\n       Although I am an optimist, I would be remiss if I did not point out some risks to this otherwise rosy scenario. The difficulty of reaching agreement in the Doha Round of trade negotiations highlights the risk of renewed protectionism. Trade barriers reduce both domestic and international competition, one of the key factors behind low inflation, and make all countries poorer. Barriers to free flow of goods, services, and capital would also diminish the force of other factors outlined above that help to reduce inflationary pressures.We must not forget the examples of high inflation and hyperinflation from the past: They hold important lessons about the costs of not maintaining price stability. That sound policies are the basis for solid economic growth should not be forgotten.Footnotes In my remarks today, I would like to discuss the relationship between energy markets and the economy. As I am certain all of you are aware, the steep increases in energy prices over the past several years have had significant consequences for households, businesses, and economic policy. At least since the time of the first oil shock in October 1973, economists have struggled to understand the ways that disturbances to the supply and demand balance in energy markets influence economic growth and inflation. At the most basic level, oil and natural gas are just primary commodities, like tin, rubber, or iron ore. Yet energy commodities are special, in part because they are critical inputs to a very wide variety of production processes of modern economies. They provide the fuel that drives our transportation system, heats our homes and offices, and powers our factories. Moreover, energy has an influence that is disproportionate to its share in real gross domestic product (GDP) largely because of our limited ability to adjust the amount of energy we use per unit of output over short periods of time. Over longer periods, energy consumption can be altered more easily by, for example, adjusting the types of vehicles that we drive, the kind of homes that we build, and the variety of machines that we buy. Those decisions, in turn, influence the growth and composition of the stock of capital and the productive capacity of the economy.Over the past thirty-five years, the U.S. economy has experienced some wide swings in energy prices. The oil price increases of the 1970s were followed by price declines in the mid-1980s and then a price spike in 1990, with numerous fluctuations since then. From the mid-1980s until fairly recently, market participants tended to look through these price cycles and did not allow their longer-term expectations for oil prices to be greatly affected by short-run swings in spot prices. But beginning around 2003, futures prices began moving up roughly in line with the rise in spot prices. Thus, unlike in earlier episodes, the significantly higher relative price of energy that we are now experiencing is expected to be relatively long lasting and thus will likely prompt more-significant adjustments by households and businesses over time.This higher relative price of energy poses many important questions for economists and policymakers. Why have the prices of oil and natural gas risen so much? What is the outlook for energy supplies and prices in the medium term and in the long term? And what implications does the behavior of energy prices have for the ongoing economic expansion and inflation? I will touch briefly on each of these questions.Developments in Oil MarketsLet me begin with the market for crude oil. What accounts for the behavior of the current and expected future prices of petroleum? Supply and demand are among the most valuable concepts in the economist\\'s toolkit, and I believe they are the key to understanding recent and prospective developments in oil markets. For the most part, high oil prices reflect high and growing demand for oil and limited and uncertain supplies.On the demand side, world oil consumption surged 4 percent in 2004 after rising a solid 2 percent in 2003. The rise in 2004 was much larger than had been expected and was, in fact, the largest yearly increase in a quarter-century. A significant part of the unexpected increase in oil consumption that year reflected rapidly growing oil use in the United States and East Asia, notably China. In 2005, growth of world oil consumption slowed to 1.3 percent, partly reflecting the restraining effects of higher prices. Nonetheless, the level of oil consumption was still high relative to earlier expectations. Thus far this year, underlying demand pressures have remained strong in the context of a global economy that has continued to expand robustly.On the supply side, the production of oil has been constrained by available capacity, hurricanes, and geopolitical developments. In 2003 and 2004, as oil consumption and prices rose briskly, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pumped more oil. OPEC was able to boost production relatively quickly in response to changing market conditions by utilizing productive capacity that had been idle. By the end of 2004, however, OPEC\\'s spare production capacity was greatly diminished. As a consequence, OPEC\\'s oil production flattened out over the past year even as oil prices continued to soar.Oil production outside OPEC also leveled off last year, contrary to earlier expectations for continued growth. This development in part reflected the devastating effects of last year\\'s hurricanes. Katrina and Rita were enormously disruptive for our nation\\'s production of energy. At the worst point, 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil were shut in, virtually all of the U.S. production in the Gulf of Mexico and nearly 2 percent of global oil production. Recovery of oil production in the Gulf has been slow, and the disruptions from last year\\'s storms linger even as we enter this year\\'s hurricane season. The cumulative loss in oil production attributable to Katrina and Rita amounts to more than 160 million barrels of oil, a figure equivalent to nearly half the present level of commercial crude oil inventories in the United States.With the background of strong demand and limited spare capacity, both actual production disruptions and concerns about the reliability and security of future oil supplies have contributed to the volatility in oil prices. The oil-rich Middle East remains an especially unsettled region of the world, but political risks to the oil supply have also emerged in nations outside the Middle East, including Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.Compounding these difficulties in markets for crude oil have been constraints and disruptions in the refining sector of the energy industry. In the wake of Hurricane Rita, one-quarter of domestic refining capacity was offline, and here, too, the period of recovery has been protracted. Even before last year\\'s hurricanes, however, a mismatch appeared to be emerging between the incremental supply of crude oil, which tended to be heavy and sulfurous, and the demand by refiners for light, sweet crude, which can be converted more easily into clean-burning transportation fuels. These developments have highlighted the need for additional investments in refining capacity to bridge the gap between upstream supply and final demand.What about the longer term? We can safely assume that world economic growth, together with the rapid pace of industrialization in China, India, and other emerging-market economies, will generate increasing demand for oil and other forms of energy. In all likelihood, growth in the demand for energy will be tempered to some extent by continued improvements in energy efficiency which, in turn, will be stimulated by higher prices and ongoing concerns about the security of oil supplies. Such improvements are possible even without technological breakthroughs. For example, Japan is an advanced industrial nation that uses only about one-half as much energy to produce a dollar\\'s worth of real output as the United States does. Of course, the Japanese and U.S. economies differ in important ways, but the comparison nevertheless suggests that there is scope to boost energy efficiency in the United States and other parts of the industrialized world. Newly industrializing economies such as China appear to be quite inefficient in their use of energy; but as they modernize, they can adopt energy-saving techniques already in use elsewhere, and their energy efficiency will presumably improve as well.Still, as the global economic expansion continues, substantial growth in the use of oil and other energy sources appears to be inevitable. How readily the supply side of the oil market will respond is difficult to predict. In a physical sense, the world is not in imminent danger of running out of oil. At the end of 2005, the world\\'s proved reserves of conventional oil--that is, oil in the ground that is viewed as recoverable using existing technologies and under current economic conditions--stood at more than 1.2 trillion barrels, about 15 percent higher than the world\\'s proved reserves a decade earlier and equal to about four decades of global consumption at current rates. These figures do not include Canada\\'s vast deposits of oil sands, which are estimated to contain an additional 174 billion barrels of proved reserves. In addition, today\\'s proved reserve figures ignore not only the potential for new discoveries but also the likelihood that improved technologies and higher oil prices will increase the amount of oil that can be economically recovered.The oil is there, but whether substantial new sources of production can be made available over the next five years or so is in some doubt. Some important fields are in locations that are technically difficult and time-consuming to develop, such as deep-water fields off the coast of West Africa, in the Gulf of Mexico, or off the east coast of South America. In many cases, the development of new fields also faces the challenge of recovering the oil without damaging delicate ecosystems. Perhaps most troubling are the significant uncertainties generated by geopolitical instability, as I have already noted. Much of the world\\'s oil reserves are located in areas where political turmoil and violence have restrained both production and investment.In both the developed and the developing world, another factor holding back investment in oil infrastructure has been concern on the part of producers that oil prices might fall back as they did in the 1980s and 1990s. In light of that recognition, some oil producers have been reluctant to launch exploration projects even with today\\'s high prices. Such concerns have been reinforced by the huge reserves of oil in several OPEC countries that could be extracted at very low cost if sufficient resources and expertise were directed toward doing so.Developments in the Natural Gas MarketThe story for natural gas shares some similarities with the story for oil, but there are important differences as well. In the 1990s, the U.S. spot price of natural gas at the Henry Hub averaged about $2 per million Btu. However, in recent years, the United States has seen a marked increase in the price of natural gas. The average spot price climbed to nearly $9 per million Btu in 2005, with the price spiking to $15 per million Btu following hurricanes Katrina and Rita. So far this year, natural gas prices have fallen back to around $7 per million Btu as an unusually warm winter curtailed consumption and boosted natural gas in storage to record levels. Futures markets currently anticipate that the price of natural gas will be about $9 per million Btu next year.Why have natural gas prices risen so sharply over the past few years, and why are they expected to remain elevated? As with oil, high prices of natural gas reflect strong demand and diminished supplies. Unlike the globally integrated market for oil, however, natural gas markets are regional, primarily because of the difficulty in transporting gas by means other than pipelines. Although the world\\'s capacity to trade liquefied natural gas, which is transported by ships, is growing, it is still a small fraction of world supply and is not yet sufficient to fully integrate natural gas markets across continents. Demand for natural gas in North America has remained strong in recent years, particularly as environmental concerns have led clean-burning natural gas to become the fuel of choice for new electricity generation. Moreover, increases in oil prices have boosted the demand for energy substitutes such as natural gas. However, domestic production of natural gas has not kept up. Last year, U.S. production was 7 percent below its 2001 level, with less than half of that decline reflecting the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Increased trade can often mitigate price increases, but net imports of natural gas from Canada, which currently account for around 16 percent of U.S. consumption, have failed to increase in response to higher prices. Between 1988 and 2001, net imports from Canada tripled, but they have since flattened out. Both U.S. and Canadian gas fields have matured and are yielding smaller increases in output, despite the incentive of high prices and a substantial increase in the number of drilling rigs in operation.Trade in liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is also likely to increase over time, but perhaps at a slower pace than once envisioned. LNG imports into the United States nearly tripled from 2002 to 2004, but they actually fell a bit last year as production disruptions in a number of countries limited supply and as consumers in other countries competed for available cargoes.Thus, natural gas prices are likely to remain elevated for at least the coming few years. It is possible, however, that within a decade new supplies from previously untapped areas of North America could boost available output here, while imports of LNG will increase to more substantial levels as countries seek to bring their isolated natural gas reserves to market. Given time, these developments could serve to lower natural gas prices in the United States significantly. Nonetheless, because of the higher costs of producing these supplies relative to the traditional sources of natural gas, as well as the elevated cost of other energy sources such as oil, natural gas prices seem unlikely to return to the level of the 1990s.Thus, the supply-demand fundamentals seem consistent with the view now taken by market participants that the days of persistently cheap oil and natural gas are likely behind us. The good news is that, in the longer run, we have options. I have already noted the scope for improvements in energy efficiency and increased conservation. Considerable potential exists as well for substituting other energy sources for oil and natural gas, including coal, nuclear energy, and renewable sources such as bio-fuels and wind power. Given enough time, market mechanisms are likely to increase energy supplies, including alternative energy sources, while simultaneously encouraging conservation and substitution away from oil and natural gas to other types of energy.Economic and Policy Implications of Increased Energy PricesWhat are the economic implications of the higher energy prices that we are experiencing? In the long run, higher energy prices are likely to reduce somewhat the productive capacity of the U.S. economy. That outcome would occur, for example, if high energy costs make businesses less willing to invest in new capital or cause some existing capital to become economically obsolete. All else being equal, these effects tend to restrain the growth of labor productivity, which in turn implies that real wages and profits will be lower than they otherwise would have been. Also, the higher cost of imported oil is likely to adversely affect our terms of trade; that is, Americans will have to sell more goods and services abroad to pay for a given quantity of oil and other imports. For the medium term at least, the higher bill for oil imports will increase the U.S. current account deficit, implying a greater need for foreign financing.Under the assumption that energy prices do not move sharply higher from their already high levels, these long-run effects, though clearly negative, appear to be manageable. The U.S. economy is remarkably flexible, and it seems to have absorbed the cost shocks of the past few years with only a few dislocations. And conservation and the development of alternative energy sources will, over the long term, ameliorate some of the effects of higher energy prices. Moreover, ongoing productivity gains arising from sources such as technological improvements are likely to exceed by a significant margin the productivity losses created by high energy prices.In the short run, sharply higher energy prices create a rather different and, in some ways, a more difficult set of economic challenges. Indeed, a significant increase in energy prices can simultaneously slow economic growth while raising inflation.An increase in oil prices slows economic growth in the short run primarily through its effects on consumer spending. Because the United States imports much of the oil that it consumes, an increase in oil prices is, as many economists have noted, broadly analogous to the imposition of a tax on U.S. residents, with the revenue from the tax going to oil producers abroad. In 2004 as a whole, the total cost of imported oil increased almost $50 billion relative to 2003. The imported oil bill jumped again last year by an additional $70 billion, and given the price increases we have experienced in 2006, it appears on track to increase $50 billion further at an annual rate in the first half of this year. Coupled with the rising cost of imported natural gas, the cumulative increase in imported energy costs since the end of 2003 is shaping up to be $185 billion--equal to almost 1-1/2 percent of GDP. All else being equal, this constitutes a noticeable drag on real household incomes and spending. It is a tribute to the underlying strength and resiliency of the U.S. economy that it has been able to perform well despite the drag from increased energy prices.At the same time that higher oil prices slow economic growth, they also create inflationary pressures. Higher prices for crude oil are passed through to increased prices for the refined products used by consumers, such as gasoline and heating oil. When oil prices rise, people may try to substitute other forms of energy, such as natural gas, leading to price increases in those alternatives as well. The rise in prices paid by households for energy--for example for gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas--represent, of course, an increase in the cost of living and in price inflation. This direct effect of higher energy prices on the cost of living is sometimes called the first-round effect on inflation. In addition, higher energy costs may have indirect effects on the inflation rate--if, for example, firms pass on their increased costs of production in the form of higher consumer prices for non-energy goods or services or if workers respond to the increase in the cost of living by demanding higher nominal wages. A jump in energy costs could also increase the public\\'s longer-term inflation expectations, a factor that would put additional upward pressure on inflation. These indirect effects of higher energy prices on the overall rate of inflation are called second-round effects.The overall inflation rate reflects both first-round and second-round effects. Economists and policymakers also pay attention to the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the direct effects of increases in the prices of energy (as well as of food). By stripping out the first-round inflation effects, core inflation provides a useful indicator of the second-round effects of increases in the price of energy.In the past, notably during the 1970s and early 1980s, both the first-round and second-round effects of oil-price increases on inflation tended to be large, as firms freely passed on rising energy costs to consumers, workers reacted to the surging cost of living by ratcheting up their wage demands, and longer-run expectations of inflation moved up quickly. In this situation, monetary policymaking was extremely difficult because oil-price increases threatened to result in a large and persistent increase in the overall inflation rate. The Federal Reserve attempted to contain the inflationary effects of the oil-price shocks by engineering sharp increases in interest rates, actions which had the consequence of sharply slowing growth and raising unemployment, as in the recessions that began in 1973 and 1981.Since about 1980, however, the Federal Reserve and most other central banks have worked hard to bring inflation and expectations of inflation down. An important benefit of these efforts is that the second-round inflation effect of a given increase in energy prices has been much reduced. To the extent that households and business owners expect that the Fed will keep inflation low, firms have both less incentive and less ability to pass on increased energy costs in the form of higher prices, and likewise workers have less incentive to demand compensating increases in their nominal wages.As I noted in remarks last week, although the rate of pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices to core consumer price inflation appears to have remained relatively low in the current episode--reflecting the inflation-fighting credibility built by the Fed in recent decades the cumulative increases in energy and commodity prices have been large enough that they could account for some of the recent pickup in core inflation. In addition, some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged up, on net, in recent months, as has the compensation for inflation and inflation risk implied by yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt. As yet, these expectations measures have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in recent years and inflation compensation implied by yields on government debt has fallen back somewhat in the past month. Nevertheless, these developments bear watching.In conclusion, energy prices have moved up considerably since the end of 2002, reflecting supply and demand factors. In the short run, prices are likely to remain high in an environment of strong world economic growth and a limited ability to increase energy supplies. Moreover, prices are likely to be volatile in the near term, given the small margins of excess capacity to produce crude oil or natural gas that traditionally have buffered short-run shifts in supply and demand.However, in the long run, market forces will respond. The higher relative prices of energy will create incentives for businesses to create new, energy-saving technologies and for energy consumers to adopt them. The market for alternative fuels is growing rapidly and will help to shift consumption away from petroleum-based fuels. Government can contribute to these conservation efforts by working to create a regulatory environment that encourages the growth in energy supplies in a manner that is consistent with our nation\\'s environmental and other objectives. Given the extraordinary resilience of the U.S. economy, I am confident our nation will be up to this challenge. Of course, the trend toward greater international integration of product and financial markets has been established for quite a while; the share of U.S. economic activity involved in international trade (measured by nominal exports plus imports as a share of nominal gross domestic product) has been rising since the early 1970s. However, this trend has accelerated markedly over the past fifteen years or so. In particular, the economies of eastern Europe became more integrated into the global economy, and China, India, and some other East Asian market economies have emerged as important players in the global trading system.However, the extent of the disinflationary effect of this shift in the pace of globalization is less obvious. Many U.S. goods and most services are still produced domestically with little competition from abroad. In addition, the significant expansion of production in China and elsewhere has put substantial upward pressure on the prices of oil and other commodities, many of which are imported for use as inputs to production in the United States. Indeed, the effects of globalization on domestic inflation need not even be negative, especially in today’s environment of strong global growth.In trying to clarify my own thinking about the likely magnitude of these effects, I find that a useful starting point is a simple reduced-form equation that attempts to explain movements in inflation and then to ask whether and how the statistical relationships embedded in this equation have been affected by globalization. The equation is a standard one in use at the Board and elsewhere. It relates core consumer price inflation--using, say, the index for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) or the core consumer price index (CPI)--to resource utilization, lagged inflation, changes in relative prices of food and energy, and changes in relative import prices. Using this framework, we can look for the effect of globalization in several ways. First, we can look for influences that are directly controlled for in the model--notably the influence on domestic inflation of changes in import prices. Second, we can look for evidence of globalization-related structural change in the model by examining the stability of the parameter estimates. Third, we can see whether we have omitted from the standard model any variables that might be interpreted as representing changes in globalization. And, finally, we can look for evidence of model errors that would be consistent with the hypothesis that globalization has been restraining inflation. I will focus in particular on the past five years or so, which, judging from the data on U.S. trade shares, is when the pace of globalization appears to have picked up.In addition, import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the United States. This step-up in the rate of change of import prices obviously reflects, to some extent, recent movements in the dollar, especially its depreciation in 2004. However, it also reflects large increases in the prices of a number of imported commodities, which have been attributed in part to the rapid expansion of activity in China and other Asian countries.A second hypothesis is that increases in global capacity have held down U.S. inflation in recent years by limiting the ability of U.S. producers to raise prices in response to increases in the domestic costs of production. At a basic level, the elevated profit margins of U.S. producers over the past few years seem inconsistent with this hypothesis. But it does raise a broader issue about the determinants of inflation--that is, whether U.S. inflation is now less sensitive to domestic demand pressures and more sensitive to foreign demand conditions than it was earlier. In the context of the inflation model, we can examine this issue in two ways. First, we can look for evidence that the coefficients on the domestic output or unemployment gaps have fallen over time. Second, we can add a measure of foreign excess demand to the model to see whether it helps to explain domestic inflation in recent years.With regard to the first test, we do find evidence that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has fallen in the United States. In particular, the coefficient from a model estimated over the past twenty years appears to be about one-third lower than when the model is run over a forty-year period. Of course, globalization is not the only potential explanation for this result, and numerous other researchers have cited persistently low inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy as having played a more important role. In fact, in rolling regressions, the timing of the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment gap appears to be too early to be associated with the more recent acceleration in the pace of globalization.In this regard, I would note that a potential shortcoming of my approach to assessing the effects of globalization on inflation is that these effects may be too recent to be captured adequately by the data. That is, it may be too soon for globalization to have generated statistically observable changes in the parameter estimates or structure of the standard inflation model. Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends. For example, if recent increases in world labor supply are restraining domestic unit labor costs to a significant degree or if there are other important influences on inflation that are related to globalization but difficult to quantify in the context of the standard model, we would expect to have seen sizable model errors over the past several years.Again, the evidence points to some limited influence of globalization on U.S. inflation. If we use out-of-sample dynamic simulations of a model for core PCE price inflation estimated from 1985 through the end of 2001, we find that, although the model overpredicts inflation over the past several years, the errors average only 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point per year, considerably less than one might have expected given the anecdotes in the popular press. In contrast, the forecast errors from a model of core CPI inflation are larger (averaging roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point per year since mid-2001), perhaps suggestive of some influence from globalization.What do I conclude from all of this evidence? My own assessment is that, quite naturally, the greater integration of the U.S. economy into a rapidly evolving world economy has affected the dynamics of inflation determination. Unfortunately, huge gaps and puzzles remain in our analysis and empirical testing of various hypotheses related to these effects. But, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive. In particular, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system probably has exerted a modest disinflationary force on prices in the United States in recent years.Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years. They reflect, at least in part, the global imbalances that are the subject of this conference, rather than just the integration of emerging-market economies into the global trading system. For example, the fact that China and some other emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressure on their exchange rates and are running trade surpluses has undoubtedly contributed to their disinflationary effects on the rest of the world. The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding. These imbalances are not likely to be sustained indefinitely. The elevated rates of national saving in these economies--and, in some, relatively restrained rates of investment--are not likely to persist in the face of ongoing improvements in the functioning of their financial markets, increases in the depth of their product markets, and fuller development of economic safety nets. As individuals in these countries are increasingly drawn to investing at home and consuming more of their wealth and as their real wages catch up to past productivity gains, the upward pressures on their currencies will intensify, their demand will come into better alignment with their capacity to produce, cost advantages will decline, and these economies will exert less, if any, downward pressure on inflation in the United States.This observation brings me to my final point, which is about monetary policy. Clearly, the greater integration of the world’s economies does leave the United States more open to influences from abroad. In one sense, a more open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports. And, to the extent that the United States can draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped for a time. But we are also subject to inflationary forces from abroad, including those that might accompany a shift to a more sustainable pattern of global spending and production, or those that might emanate from rising cost and price pressures. Moreover, a smaller response of inflation to domestic demand also implies that reducing inflation once it rose could be difficult and costly. And, from another perspective, integrated financial markets can exert powerful feedback, which may be less forgiving of any perceived policy error. For example, if financial market participants thought that the FOMC was not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability--a notion that I can assure you is not correct--they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets, and the resulting decline in the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures. Clearly, policymakers need to factor into their decisions the implications of globalization for the dynamics of the determination of inflation and output.In the end, however, policymakers here and abroad cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: In a world of separate currencies that can fluctuate against each other over time, each country’s central bank determines its inflation rate. If the FOMC were to allow the U.S. economy to run beyond its sustainable potential for some time, inflation would eventually rise. And, this pickup would become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations. Thus, while a better understanding of the implications of globalization will aid in our understanding of inflation dynamics, it is also clear that such developments do not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability.Footnotes Governor Randall S. Kroszner presented identical remarks at the Bankers\\' Association for Finance and Trade, New York, New York, on June 15, 2006Today I want to talk about some new and exciting developments in bond markets around the world. The motivation for my discussion is the current puzzling situation of a relatively flat yield curve combined with relatively low real and nominal long-term interest rates, which has occurred both in developed economies and in emerging markets. I will explore some possible explanations for the pattern and will focus on changes in the prospects for and risks to the long-term inflation outlook, particularly in emerging-market economies. In particular, I will highlight how financial innovations and international competitive pressures, combined with a better public understanding of the costs of inflation and changes in the institutions of central banking, have helped improve the credibility of central banks and inflation outcomes in many emerging markets.Until recently, many emerging-market countries simply did not have a yield curve because there was effectively no market for debt issued in domestic currency beyond a very short horizon. The credibility of central banks has been crucial to this deepening of the domestic capital market, which is typically associated with higher economic growth.I am optimistic that these developments will continue, as I believe that the move toward low inflation rates reflects important technological and institutional factors that are likely to persist. Nevertheless, there are still risks, which underscore the importance of continuing to reap the benefits of improved central bank behavior and credibility in emerging markets and around the world.The combination of a rising short rate and a relatively stable long rate has led to a very flat yield curve. During the last quarter-century, for example, the difference between the yield on the ten-year Treasury note and the yield on the three-month Treasury bill has been roughly 1-3/4 percent (or, to be exact, 179 basis points from 1980 to the present). During the last year, that difference has been less than 50 basis points and is currently less than half of that. Thus, this essentially flat slope is atypical in U.S. experience.The U.S. bond market conundrum has occurred in parallel with similar developments in foreign bond markets. In major industrial countries, bond yields have trended down, in some cases reaching historical lows recently. Yields are also low in real terms, as measured by inflation-indexed bonds. Far-forward short rates in recent years have also reached unusually low levels in many industrial countries.The most interesting and, I believe, perhaps least studied recent developments in the bond markets concern the changes in emerging markets. While it is well known that the yield spreads on dollar-denominated bonds of emerging-market governments included in the EMBI+ index are near all time lows (even taking into account the recent rise), two phenomena in emerging markets have received less attention.One is the development of markets for longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in local currencies. This phenomenon is, from my perspective, quite remarkable and belies the assertion that the \"original sins\" of bad policy from the past have doomed the development of domestic currency bond markets in many emerging markets. The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt markets has, in many cases, not only extended a yield curve but effectively created a local currency yield curve that simply did not exist earlier.Since 2000, ten-year nominal fixed-coupon bonds in local currency have been introduced in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia, while Korea issued a ten-year fixed coupon bond in 1995. To illustrate in more detail, the governments of Mexico and Korea have been able extend the average maturity of their local-currency debt significantly in just the past few years. The Mexican government issued ten-year maturities in 2001 and then 20-year maturities in 2003. The proportion of local-currency debt in Mexico maturing within one year was nearly 90 percent in 2002 and is now below 75 percent. (I have included floating rate debt in the one-year maturity category.) The Korean government continues to increase the proportion of its domestic currency debt in longer maturities, with the one-year-and-under segment falling from roughly one-half in 1999 to one-quarter by the end of last year.Two, bond yields in local currencies of emerging-market countries have also declined. It is perhaps not surprising that, given their high rates of saving and generally high level of economic development, the governments of Hong Kong and Korea can borrow at close to industrial-country levels. More notable, however, is that the Mexican government can borrow in pesos at a ten-year maturity at rates that have averaged roughly 9 percent. And Mexico is not unique in this regard. Other middle-income emerging markets with ten-year local-currency fixed rate bond yields in the single digits include Chile, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand, to name but a few. For countries with longer maturities, implied short-term interest rates five years ahead also have been declining and have reached very low levels, although there have been some increases in the past few months.What is driving these changes? There are a number of complementary, not alternative, explanations.However, there is also a nominal aspect of low global bond yields. In the rest of my talk, I would like to emphasize the worldwide decline of inflation and perceived inflation risk as a key contributor to low nominal bond yields.Explanations for the Low Nominal Bond Yields\\xa0\\n       Inflation rates in major industrial and developing regions have trended down over the past twenty-five years. Compared with the period 1980 to 1999, median inflation rates from 2000 to 2004 fell from 5 percent to 2 percent in industrialized countries and from 14 percent to 4-1/2 percent in emerging markets, according to the most recent statistics from the International Monetary Fund. Not long ago, annual inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico at times exceeded 100 percent. But during the past decade, Brazilian and Mexican inflation rates have remained low. In particular, inflation in Brazil did not spike up after its financial crises and sharp currency depreciations in the late 1990s. Given Brazil’s history of hyperinflation, this stability is especially remarkable. Brazil did experience a small spike of inflation around its presidential election in 2002, but even this was minor by historical standards. The pattern of low inflation is seen across many countries, large and small.Do markets expect low inflation to persist in the long run? To answer this question, we can look at measures of expected inflation. Consensus Economics surveys hundreds of professional forecasters in numerous countries each April. The surveys allow us to examine forecasts of inflation around the world six to ten years ahead beginning in 1996. The latest observation, in April 2006, for example, is the forecast of a given country’s average consumer price inflation rate from 2012 through 2016. For both a representative sample of industrial economies (Euro area, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) and emerging-market economies (Brazil, China, Korea, and Mexico), we observe substantial declines from the late 1990s to today. These forecasts have been low and stable in both industrial and many important developing countries in recent years. The surveys thus provide one indication that markets do expect low inflation to persist.The volatility of inflation has also declined notably, suggesting that perceived inflation risk may have declined as well. For the industrial countries, inflation volatility (measured as a twenty-quarter rolling standard deviation of consumer price inflation) has declined from the 1980s to the 1990s to the period since 2000. Although it has since drifted up just a bit due to volatility in oil prices, it remains at or near its lowest level in the last quarter-century. For the emerging markets, the decline in volatility is even more dramatic. Brazil, in particular, was off the chart much of the time before the late 1990s. Volatility of inflation in China, Korea, and Mexico is now at levels similar to those of the industrial countries, and volatility in Brazil is not much higher.Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation around the world has led to a reduction in inflation expectations and lower perceived inflation risk, hence a lower inflation uncertainty premium in long rates. I believe that these factors have been important contributors to the lower long-term yields and the flattening of yield curves, particularly in emerging markets. The existence of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.Factors Behind the Global Move to Price Stability\\n       Four broad factors lie behind the move to price stability, especially in emerging markets, and these factors tend to reinforce each other. Each factor affects the cost-benefit tradeoff of pursuing a high-inflation policy.Given these innovations, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit for each unit increase in inflation because people can more easily switch out of the local currency. In other words, the inflation tax becomes much more difficult and costly to levy because citizens can more easily avoid the tax by using an alternative money.The second and closely related factor behind disinflation is deregulation and competition in a globalized marketplace. The collapse of the centrally-planned economies has led many countries to turn increasingly to private markets to deliver growth and progress and reduce the role of government. Technology has helped to increase global competition by shrinking the barriers of time and distance. Again, there are several channels by which globalization and competition may have affected the cost-benefit tradeoff in pursing inflation:The fourth factor I wish to mention relates to changes in the institutions of central banking that may have increased the costs of pursuing high-inflation policies. The most notable change is the increased independence of many central banks and the corresponding reduced control of the fiscal authorities over monetary policy. Central bank independence reduces the ability of a government to \"raid the cookie jar\" through a surprise inflation tax. In most cases, central bank independence can be reversed by a majority vote of parliament. But having to resort to such a vote is a greater obstacle to inflationary finance than previous arrangements allowed, especially given the public’s increased sensitivity and aversion to inflation.Central bank independence has typically been granted in conjunction with an explicit mandate that makes achieving low and stable inflation one of the goals of monetary policy. Central bank independence with a mandate that includes price stability increases the credibility of monetary policy with regard to achieving low inflation. Policy is credible because the central bank’s objectives are clear to the public and the central bank can be held accountable for failing to achieve its objectives.Benefits of Price Stability\\n       While it is well known that low and stable inflation improves the environment for investment planning and avoids many costs and disruptions associated with frequent price adjustments, I want to focus on a few of the many benefits that are particularly relevant for emerging markets.The development of long-term local-currency bond markets may also help governments and firms plan long-term infrastructure and investment projects that boost economic development. Although such debt markets are only one of many factors that can lower the costs of long-term planning and enhance the ability to undertake long-term investments, the development of these markets, particularly when accompanied by lower real rates, help to support longer-horizon projects and reduce the effect of foreign exchange movements on such activities.A better fiscal outlook, which might arise from higher and more stable growth as well as better long-term planning, also increases financial market confidence and development and thus further boosts growth and reinforces prospects for continued price stability. This virtuous cycle appears to be happening in key emerging markets that were long plagued with poor fiscal situations, such as Brazil and Mexico. In the 1980s and early 1990s, for example, public sector deficits in these countries often exceeded 10 percent of GDP. Since the late 1990s, deficits have been diminished.Maintaining this Progress\\n       Although I am an optimist, I would be remiss if I did not point out some risks to this otherwise rosy scenario. The difficulty of reaching agreement in the Doha Round of trade negotiations highlights the risk of renewed protectionism. Trade barriers reduce both domestic and international competition, one of the key factors behind low inflation, and make all countries poorer. Barriers to free flow of goods, services, and capital would also diminish the force of other factors outlined above that help to reduce inflationary pressures.We must not forget the examples of high inflation and hyperinflation from the past: They hold important lessons about the costs of not maintaining price stability. That sound policies are the basis for solid economic growth should not be forgotten.Footnotes The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months. Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remain contained. However, the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, I am honored to have been nominated by President Bush to be the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and grateful to this Committee for scheduling this hearing so expeditiously. I have enjoyed a long and productive relationship with the Banking Committee and its staff over the years, working together to determine how the Federal Reserve can best contribute to the economic well-being of our citizens. As a governor and, if you confirm me, as Vice Chairman, I look forward to continuing to be a part of the shared pursuit of that goal. \\nThe Board\\'s Vice Chairman has a very limited role under the Federal Reserve Act--to preside over the Board in the absence of the Chairman. By tradition and practice, however, the Vice Chairman has played a leadership role within the System. He or she has acted as the Chairman\\'s deputy or alternate in important international groups, has headed ad hoc committees within the Board, System, or Federal Open Market Committee to help develop policy alternatives for consideration by the larger group, has helped the Chairman to lead the Board, and has worked closely with the Chairman in a variety of circumstances, including when responding to disturbances in the financial sector that had the potential of affecting the broader economy.\\nThe Federal Reserve faces considerable challenges today in meeting the responsibilities that you have given us: for fostering price stability and maximum employment at a time of rapid change in the U.S. and global economies; for helping maintain a safe and sound banking system and stable and efficient payments and financial systems in the face of innovations in financial instruments and institutions; and for protecting and educating consumers as they take advantage of the greater variety and sophistication of financial instruments available to them. I believe that my long and wide experience within the Federal Reserve--at a Reserve Bank and at the Board, on staff and as governor--along with my close working relationship with Chairman Bernanke will enable me to make even greater contributions to the work of the Federal Reserve as the Board\\'s Vice Chairman should you choose to confirm me to this position. Chairman Bachus, Representative Sanders, and members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to be here to discuss the uses and significance of the home loan data that are collected, reported, and publicly disclosed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.\\nThe act, which I will refer to as HMDA, was enacted over thirty years ago. Since then, it has undergone major changes. Today, HMDA requires most home lenders, a substantial majority of the home loan market, to disclose selected information about the applications they receive and the loans they extend each year. This information can be used for at least three purposes: first, to help the public judge how well lenders are meeting the housing-credit needs of their communities; second, to facilitate efficient investment in housing and neighborhoods; and third, to enhance the enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in lending.\\nHMDA promotes these goals through disclosure rather than substantive mandates or restrictions. The act does not direct lenders to make loans to any particular areas or persons. Nor does it direct lenders to make particular kinds of loans or to refrain from any particular loan terms or practices.\\nInstead, HMDA prescribes lender disclosures that, taken together, form a public data set about lending patterns. Every reportable application for a loan occupies a unique line in the data set. In 2005, there were approximately 31 million reported loan applications. The information disclosed about each application includes the race, ethnicity, and income of the applicant, the type and amount of the loan applied for, whether the loan was originated or the application was denied, and the census tract of the property to be financed. For the public’s convenience, summary reports of the data are published by metropolitan area and by institution--for almost 9,000 depository and nondepository institutions. These summary reports are compiled by the Federal Reserve Board on behalf of the agency members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The Board also processes and edits the transaction-level data, which the FFIEC makes available to members of the public, who may analyze and compile the data as they see fit.\\nThe information disclosed under HMDA constitutes a rich data set, but, of course, all data sets have their limitations. The HMDA data tell a great deal about lending patterns, but they do not tell the entire story. Nonetheless, by drawing attention to lending patterns, the data prompt discussion, investigation, analysis, and research that may deepen our understanding of why these patterns occur and allow us to increase fairness and efficiency in the home loan market. For example, in 1991, congressional amendments to HMDA resulted in the disclosure of data that, for the first time, revealed black and Hispanic applicants for mortgage loans were far more likely than non-Hispanic white applicants to have their applications denied. The publication of those data precipitated an important public discussion about the underlying causes--and about whether unlawful discrimination was one of the causes. That discussion helped bring about new initiatives for compliance and community development. Many lenders improved their lending policies and developed strong compliance and oversight programs. Lenders also expanded their outreach to underserved communities, often by strengthening ties with community-based organizations. The data also prompted supervisory and enforcement agencies to improve their fair lending oversight programs. In short, though denial disparities have persisted, HMDA’s disclosure of those disparities has helped to increase the fairness and efficiency of the home loan market.\\nLast year we passed another HMDA milestone when the first loan-level information about mortgage loan prices was released. The public discussion that the release of these data has prompted is reminiscent of the discussion that took place after the initial release of loan-denial data fifteen years ago. Today, the focus of the discussion has shifted from which consumers get home loans to the terms on which consumers get home loans--but the essential concern about the possible role of illegal discrimination is the same. I believe that the current public discussion about the new data will ultimately further the goals of fairness and efficiency in the mortgage market by prompting additional research, enhanced compliance and enforcement efforts, and more-effective investment in community development and financial literacy.\\nThe Federal Reserve has responsibilities that relate to each of these areas. In my testimony today, I will discuss four roles of the Federal Reserve that relate to the HMDA data. First, the Federal Reserve Board was entrusted by Congress to write implementing rules for HMDA. Acting in that capacity, the Board required lenders to report loan-price data. Second, as a supervisor of financial institutions, the Federal Reserve uses HMDA data, including the price data, to facilitate its supervision of institutions for compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination in home lending. Third, as a research institution, the Federal Reserve conducts and publishes analyses of the price data, and it encourages research by other parties as well. Fourth, the Federal Reserve supports efforts by other organizations to use the HMDA data to identify financial education and community development needs. The Federal Reserve also supports their efforts to respond to those needs.\\nThe Board’s Decision to Collect Price InformationAs I have said, it is a Board regulation, adopted under authority of HMDA, that requires lenders to disclose loan-price data. I will now provide some background on the Board’s decision to amend that regulation to include price data. Advances in information processing technology have expanded access to credit and homeownership opportunities for consumers. In the past, individuals seeking credit to purchase a home, or seeking to borrow for some other reason, either did or did not meet the specific underwriting criteria for a particular loan product; if they did, everyone paid about the same price for that product. Today, in part because of advances in credit scoring and underwriting technology, lenders can price loans according to risk, charging different borrowers different prices on the basis of a borrower’s estimated creditworthiness.\\nThe enhanced ability of lenders to assess credit risk gave rise to a segment of the mortgage market often referred to as subprime lending. In the subprime market, higher-risk borrowers pay higher prices. Subprime lending has grown rapidly, from less than 5 percent of all mortgage lending in 1994 to an estimated 20 percent in 2005, or over $600 billion. The wider range of loan pricing available in the subprime market helped to expand consumers’ homeownership opportunities and to increase their access to home equity. But this same price variability has raised concerns about unequal treatment of borrowers. It also has raised concerns about whether certain loan terms and lending practices are appropriate, whether consumers have the ability and knowledge to shop for the most beneficial loan terms, and whether the subprime market is sufficiently competitive.\\nThe Board responded to these concerns by amending Regulation C, the regulation that implements HMDA, to expand the available data on higher-priced lending. The data released by the FFIEC in September 2005, which covered lending activity in 2004, contained the first loan-level information on loan pricing ever available to the general public. The data contain price information for loans whose prices exceeded thresholds set by the Board. The thresholds were selected to target segments of the home loan market that have raised the most concern, taking into consideration the cost and burden of reporting. The thresholds generally correspond to an unofficial line separating the prime and subprime markets. But that line of separation is not always clear, and its correspondence with the reporting thresholds is in any event imprecise. Therefore, we call loans whose prices exceed the reporting threshold \"higher-priced loans\" rather than \"subprime loans.\"\\nThis is only the second year in which price data will be publicly available under the Board’s regulation. The Board continues to monitor the effects of the regulation in an effort to understand both its benefits and costs.\\nThe Federal Reserve’s Use of HMDA Data in Fair Lending SupervisionI have spoken of the Federal Reserve’s role as the agency charged with implementing HMDA through regulations. The Federal Reserve also has a role as a supervisor of bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. In that role, the Federal Reserve has long used HMDA data to help it supervise financial institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws. The new data on higher-priced loans are yet another \"screen\" to make our fair lending supervision more effective. The Federal Reserve also shared analyses of the 2004 price data with other supervisory and enforcement agencies to assist them with their oversight of the institutions they supervise.\\nBefore I discuss how the HMDA screen fits into the process of fair lending supervision, I want to describe that process more generally. Fair lending reviews are an integral part of the Federal Reserve’s supervision for consumer compliance and are performed regularly within each examination cycle. In addition, examiners may conduct targeted fair lending reviews whenever circumstances warrant. Moreover, the Federal Reserve examines institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws regardless of whether they report price data under HMDA. Indeed, the Federal Reserve was examining for potential price discrimination well before it adopted the HMDA price-reporting requirement. Although price reporting under HMDA is limited to higher-priced loans, examiners look for unlawful price discrimination at any pricing level. Furthermore, examiners seek to detect other forms of discrimination, such as underwriting discrimination (for example, denying credit on the basis of the applicant’s race) or redlining (for example, denying credit on the basis of the racial characteristics of the applicant’s neighborhood).\\nFederal Reserve examiners use an institution’s HMDA data, including its accept-deny data for loan applications and any price data it may have reported on originations, in conjunction with other information about the institution to determine the focus of the institution’s fair lending examination. The HMDA data are incorporated into statistical management systems that produce analyses of lending patterns that aid the examination process. Starting in 2005, these analyses incorporated loan-price data. Other information that examiners use includes consumer complaints, the likely risks of an institution’s different business lines, and the adequacy of the institution’s compliance-risk management system. To gauge the risk of price discrimination, examiners consider, among other types of information, the presence of broad employee or broker discretion in pricing and the relationship, if any, between pricing and the compensation of loan officers or brokers. When examiners determine that a fair lending examination should focus on pricing, they collect additional information from the institution to evaluate whether pricing disparities can be fully attributed to legitimate factors or whether they are due, even in part, to unlawful discrimination.\\nIf unlawful discrimination is found, the institution is referred to the Department of Justice or the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as required by law. Depending on the outcome of the referral and the nature of the violation, the Federal Reserve may also take other action to fully resolve the matter. For example, the Federal Reserve may direct the institution to provide remedies to harmed parties and improve its fair lending compliance controls and policies.\\nAs the Federal Reserve has stated repeatedly, using the price and other HMDA data effectively in the supervisory process depends on a full understanding of the inherent limitations of those data. The HMDA data include valuable information, such as applicant or borrower income, loan amount, and the location of the property to be financed, but the data do not include many factors that lenders routinely consider in loan underwriting and pricing. Some of the typical credit-risk factors not included in the HMDA data are credit scores and loan-to-value ratios. Because the HMDA data lack such information, we cannot conclude from the HMDA data alone that an observed racial or ethnic difference in the prices of loans is the result of unlawful discrimination. That is why Federal Reserve examiners consider additional information about a lender, including information about its loan products and lending practices and its borrowers’ creditworthiness, before drawing conclusions about the lender’s compliance record.\\nIn addition to improving fair lending supervision and enforcement by government agencies, the new pricing data have spurred institutions to improve their own compliance. Although examiners have long considered institutions’ mortgage pricing as part of the fair lending review process, public disclosure of this pricing data appears to have given additional impetus to institutions’ compliance efforts. Many institutions have reexamined their pricing policies and procedures to ensure that they do not permit, even inadvertently, pricing differences that violate the fair lending laws. Many institutions have also reevaluated their controls to ensure that proper policies are followed. This increased attention by institutions to their own fair lending compliance is one of the principal benefits of HMDA.\\nResearch by Federal Reserve Staff and OthersSupervision for fair lending compliance deals with lending patterns at the institution level. But the HMDA data also reveal lending patterns at aggregate levels, across institutions. Disclosure of aggregate patterns can raise and focus attention on important policy questions concerning access to credit. To that end, researchers at the Federal Reserve have published numerous papers and articles. Most recently, staff published an article about patterns in the new loan-pricing data.1 I will review a few of their findings.\\nFirst, most home lenders make few, if any, higher-priced loans. In 2004, only about 500 out of the 8,850 reporting institutions made 100 or more higher-priced loans; the ten lenders with the largest volume of higher-priced loans accounted for about 40 percent of all such loans. (The FFIEC has not finished reviewing, processing, and editing the 2005 data, which were submitted in March of this year.)\\nThe 2004 data also show that 16 percent of borrowers took out higher-priced loans that year in the nation as a whole. This proportion may have increased from 2004 to 2005. For most loans, the Board’s regulation uses long-term interest rates to set the thresholds for reporting loan-price data, but mortgage loan rates more closely track short-term rates. Thus, a narrowing of the difference between short-term and long-term rates, such as occurred from 2004 to 2005, may increase the proportion of loans reported as higher-priced loans. \\nThe proportion of borrowers obtaining higher-priced loans is not geographically uniform but varies widely by region and by city. For example, in many of the metropolitan areas of the South and the Southwest, 30 percent to 40 percent of homebuyers taking out conventional loans in 2004 took out higher-priced loans. In other areas of the country, the proportion was much smaller. These differences may not be that surprising--other data show that credit scores tend to be lower on average in the South and the Southwest than elsewhere--but they may nonetheless warrant further analysis.\\nOf course, public attention has focused on a notable variation in the incidence of higher-priced lending across racial and ethnic lines: blacks and Hispanics are much more likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive higher-priced loans. In 2004, 32 percent of black borrowers and 20 percent of Hispanic borrowers received higher-priced home purchase loans, but only 9 percent of non-Hispanic white borrowers did. In other words, black homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than three times as often as non-Hispanic white homebuyers, and Hispanic homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than twice as often as non-Hispanic whites.\\nCertainly, differences of this magnitude are disturbing and raise important public policy questions. They also have led some to conclude that racial discrimination must play a role in the pricing of home loans. However, for the reasons I have explained above, we cannot use HMDA data alone to judge whether an institution has discriminated unlawfully or, therefore, whether unlawful discrimination is present in the market.\\nDespite their limitations, the HMDA data supply a key insight into the aggregate disparities: they reflect in part a segmentation of the market by race and ethnicity. Black and Hispanic borrowers are more likely to obtain mortgage loans from institutions that tend to specialize in subprime lending. Now, at least part of this segmentation of the market by race and ethnicity may reflect objective differences in borrowers’ preferences or differences in credit-risk indicators, such as credit scores, that are not included in the HMDA data. Yet the segmentation may have more troubling causes, at least in part. Segmentation may stem from borrowers being steered to lenders that charge higher prices than what is warranted by the credit characteristics of these borrowers. Borrowers may also have different levels of financial literacy, or their knowledge of the mortgage lending process may be uneven--for example, they may not understand the importance of shopping and negotiating for the best loan terms. Additional research is needed to explore all of these, and perhaps other, hypotheses.\\nThe Board will continue to conduct and promote research that explores the racial and ethnic differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending. In June and July, the Board is conducting hearings on the home equity lending market. These hearings, which I am chairing, are intended to gather information about, among other things, how consumers select their lenders and loans. The Board’s 2007 biennial community development research conference will also provide a forum for research that may help explain differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending.\\nThe Federal Reserve’s Promotion of Community Development and Financial LiteracyI have discussed the Federal Reserve’s roles in regulation, supervision, and research. Now I will turn to its role in promoting community development and financial literacy. The Federal Reserve System uses HMDA data to help banks, community organizations, and other interested groups identify community development needs and opportunities. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston tabulates HMDA data for the New England region to help regional financial institutions, community organizations, and state and local governments access and use information about their area’s regional lending patterns. In addition, the Community Affairs Offices of the Federal Reserve System encourage and facilitate collaboration among financial institutions, governments, and community organizations to improve access to mortgage credit in traditionally underserved communities. \\nThe Federal Reserve also promotes financial literacy. Board staff provide strategic advice on developing financial literacy policies, programs, partnerships, and marketing to national initiatives, such as the Jump$tart Coalition, Operation HOPE, and the DollarWi$e Campaign of the Conference of Mayors. In a parallel effort, the Federal Reserve Banks support similar regional initiatives. The Federal Reserve also collaborates with other groups on research to develop successful financial education programs and identify the most effective way to deliver these programs to intended audiences. By these and other means, the Federal Reserve seeks to address gaps in consumers’ understanding of not only home loan transactions but also financial management more broadly. These gaps in consumer understanding may be contributing to disparities in the availability and price of home loans.\\nIn closing, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve’s regulation requiring lenders to disclose price and other data on home loans; how the Federal Reserve uses the data to improve fair lending supervision; and the Federal Reserve’s promotion of research, community development, and financial literacy.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1.\\xa0Robert B.

Good afternoon, everybody.  I’d like to start off by   recognizing Tom Simpson.  This is Tom’s last FOMC meeting.  After twenty years, he is retiring in August.  [Applause]  Thank you.   The first item on the agenda is action to approve the FOIA plan and delegation.  Debbie Danker is here on this.  Are there any questions on the memo that was circulated?  If not, I need a motion.   SEVERAL.  I move. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  The next item is foreign currency and domestic open market operations.  Mr. Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For the last several meetings I have begun my comments by saying that this long period of low volatility and tight spreads continued.  Today I have to modify that.  During this intermeeting period, some levels of volatility.  Spreads remain tight and default rates low.  In the first exhibit, the top panel graphs the MSCI equity indexes since May 2004—just before the U.S. tightening cycle began.  Equity markets in all regions appreciated sharply, with emerging markets doing best.  The U.S. index (the black line at bottom) underperformed.  Not surprisingly, the high beta markets that appreciated the most also fell the most.  I’ll have more to say about some of the specific markets later.   The middle panel graphs the realized volatility since January 1 for the United States, Europe, Japan, and emerging market sub-indexes.  Volatility rose sharply, especially outside the United States right after the May FOMC meeting.  The reason for the sudden shift in sentiment is not clear.  Both institutional and retail investors had reportedly allocated significant funds to emerging market equities in the past six months and so may not have had much of a cushion to absorb May’s losses.  These investors were more likely to sell when the tide turned.  Similarly, hedge funds that sit on sinking positions.  Whether leveraged or not, investors have been more worried 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). relatively illiquid markets where the exit door is pretty small.  Emerging market equities and commodities were probably the best examples of this phenomenon.  A variant explanation centers not so much on technical factors and positioning but rather on the lagged effect of the withdrawal of so-called excess liquidity as central banks worldwide tighten monetary policy.  I’ll come back to that as well.    As the top two graphs show, the U.S. equity market has been less interesting than some of its global counterparts, many of which have fallen by double digits over the past six weeks.  The S&P 500 in contrast has fallen about 6 percent since May 9.  The busy table at the bottom of the page lists those periods in which the S&P 500 has fallen 10 percent or more since 1942.  There have been twenty-nine such periods, or roughly once every two or three years.  Viewed historically, the recent price moves are not unusual.  To drill down a bit into emerging market equities, please turn to page 2.  The top panel graphs the performance of equity markets in Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Korea, and Turkey.  The blue bars graph performance for the period from January 2, 2006, to May 10.  The red bars graph performance from May 11 through yesterday.  The middle panel graphs, for the same countries, performance of their currencies for the same periods.  The charts seem to support this notion of strong appetite for riskier assets earlier this year and then a sudden shift to reduce positions in riskier markets.  Of course, when volatility begins to rise, intermediaries such as investment banks show an increase in value at risk that they wish to reduce.  The process of reducing that risk only reinforces the trend in the short run, and assets that were thought to be uncorrelated suddenly start to move in unison.  The bottom panel graphs metal prices from January.  Like emerging market equities, metal prices rose on perceived strong fundamentals.  The momentum players jumped on board and gave prices a boost.  Prices peaked around mid-May, and as the risk-reduction phase kicked in, prices came down, though they are still up for the year.  However, the risk-reduction story goes only so far.  It is evident in specific and fairly narrow segments.  It is not evident, or is only modestly evident, in other segments.  The top right panel on page 3 graphs the MOVE index of implied volatility on Treasury yields since January 2005.  Implied volatility has remained at very low levels despite the excitement elsewhere.  In fact, as shown in the top left panel, although the VIX spiked to about 23 percent in mid-May, it quickly came off and is below its long-term average.  Similarly, although credit spreads are mildly wider, as shown in the bottom three panels, absolute levels remain generous and far below the levels observed last spring, when General Motors’ announcement caused a sudden widening of spreads.  The bullish interpretation of the recent bout of volatility is that it has been limited to narrow sets of asset classes and could be compared with last spring’s events, which did not have spillover effects outside the areas of credit derivatives and convertible arbitrage.  This view suggests that those assets that appreciated “too far too fast” effects.  The bearish case argues that too many investors have more risk on their books than they would like and will seek opportunities to sell into any rallies.  According to this view, the movements in Iceland and New Zealand in March were the precursor to May’s volatility in a broader set of markets, which may be a precursor to subsequent price declines in more developed markets.  The top panel of page 4 graphs the three-month deposit rates for the dollar (in red) and for the euro (in blue), along with three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates since probing to locate the point at which the Committee will pause from the meeting-by-meeting pattern of tightening.  In contrast, the ECB is viewed as having further to go, as seen by the wider spread between cash and forward rates.  Indeed, in the past few days ECB officials noted that the pace of tightening could be accelerated.  The middle panel graphs the evolution of current account balances at the Bank of Japan in blue and the overnight call rate in green.  CABs came down from about ¥30 trillion to the low teens over a two-month span.  However, in recent weeks the call rate has had sudden spikes toward the BOJ’s Lombard-style lending facility, which is set at 10 basis points.  In response, the BOJ added reserves.  From a low of about ¥10 trillion in early June, CABs have risen to about ¥15 trillion, compared with required reserves of about ¥5 trillion to ¥6 trillion, and yet the call rate remains stubbornly firm.  The bottom panel graphs the Japanese government bond yield curve from three months out to ten years as of yesterday and a year earlier.  As shown by the green line, a year ago the money market curve was essentially at zero, and all rates out to two years were extremely low.  Arguably the weight of all those reserves in the system worked to push down more of the yield curve toward zero.  Now, as those reserves are being withdrawn, money market rates are no longer being held down.  So while the target call rate for the BOJ remains near zero, in reality conditions have tightened up.  Outside the G3, the story is similar:  Worries about inflation are leading to modest increases in rates.  Among the countries whose central banks tightened policy during the intermeeting period were Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, South Africa, Korea, Thailand, and India.  Some, like Turkey, had fundamental and policy challenges they were addressing.  The linkage between monetary policy and asset bearish perspective cite the tightening of policy globally and the withdrawal of liquidity as risk factors going forward.  On page 5, the top panel graphs the two- and ten-year Treasury yields along with the target fed funds rate (in green).  Yields had been hovering near the current funds target but moved toward 5.25 percent as the expectation of a ¼ point move at this meeting increased.     The middle left panel graphs the ten-year breakeven inflation rate from TIPS and the five-year rate five years forward.  After rising in April, the breakeven rate came off somewhat after the Chairman’s comments to the International Monetary Conference and subsequent comments by Committee members.  The middle right panel graphs those same two rates over a longer time frame.  Despite the attention that markets have given the rise in breakevens earlier this year, broadly speaking breakevens are very close to levels observed at the beginning of the tightening cycle two years ago.  The bottom panels graph the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro and yen.   The dollar has appreciated against both.  Although the broad fundamentals have not changed, the dollar may have benefited from safe haven effects and an unwinding of short dollar positions as hedge funds and others reduced risks in recent weeks.  Finally, I want to say a few words about our recent experiences with check float, especially given processing changes related to Check 21 (Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act).  For the Desk, float tends to be a focus on Tuesdays largely because these are peak processing days.  Pronounced but episodic spikes in float began to appear last October.  The top panel on page 6 graphs the actual float (the gray bars) and our forecast for float (the red dot).  As we have been told, the major contributing factor to these behavior changes in float is a combination of hardware and software problems that have appeared in the processing of Check 21 files.  The challenge for the Desk is to forecast float and adjust reserve provisions appropriately.  At times in recent months we have been surprised by high levels of float that we did not forecast.  At other times we had the opposite surprise:  We were told to expect float that did not materialize.  For reference, the middle panel graphs the same set of months in the year-earlier period showing lower levels of float, lower volatility of float, and important for us, less variation between the forecast and the actual.  But the important question is whether we can trace float to higher levels of funds volatility given the numerous other factors that can affect the supply of reserves.  The bottom panel tries to inform, if not fully answer, that question.  The dots represent the difference between the forecast and the actual float levels.  The y axis graphs the standard deviation of the funds rate on that date.  We have arbitrarily drawn a line at 20 basis points to demarcate a high-volatility day.  The blue dots represent observation in the year-earlier period.  They tend to show small forecast errors, and those dates were not associated with high levels of volatility.  The red dots cover the more recent period, and they show six observations with very large forecast errors, of which four were associated with high levels of fed funds volatility.  Thus, one shouldn’t exaggerate the effect of Check 21 on Desk operations, but at the same time the effect should not minimized either.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.  volatility points to uncertainty about monetary policy.  But the bond market suggests very little uncertainty about monetary policy.  Can you talk about that paradox?  MR. KOS.  Yes, I think one of the interesting points about this period is that very question.  Some of the high-risk assets that had been bid up are where we have the most-pronounced price moves, and that does perhaps suggest that positioning is a bigger part of the story because bond markets were relatively tame not just in the United States but also in other, overseas bond markets.  So something of a risk adjustment seems to have happened.  I think the interesting question is why, but it’s very, very hard to discern that.  I, at least, tended to minimize the effect that uncertainty about monetary policy itself has had in causing the volatility in emerging market equities.  Certainly if one takes the opposite view, then one has some explaining to do in terms of the previous couple of years when a tightening cycle was occurring.  At different times there was uncertainty about the pace and extent of the tightening, and yet those  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  As for the turn in metals, can you talk about the relative importance of risk factors, higher interest rates, and inflation expectations?  MR. KOS.  It’s reasonable that all of those factors would have had some influence.  I suppose another factor would be the extent to which some market participants may have seen not only positioning but also future weakness from the global tightening that is occurring, especially in the industrial countries but also in China—that such tightening will at some point affect the demand for commodities and for resources.  Some of those positions and adjustments may have been fundamentally based.  If one had to explain the scale of the price moves, that would probably be a secondary factor.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Dino?  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just want to continue with the first question that you posed to Dino.  What you said in your presentation, Dino, is very close to what people have been telling me about how they are seeing the market.  Some people at the top of hedge funds and mutual funds have said that market participants saw signs of overreaching everywhere in the winter and early spring.  Then there was a period—and perhaps your charts are pointing to early May—when a good deal of retrenchment was going on.  The hedge fund and mutual fund people were not pointing to uncertainty about U.S. monetary policy so much as uncertainty about monetary policy worldwide.  But the real reason was a changed appreciation of what the worldwide economy was doing, the need for tightening because of the effect of rising growth and potential inflationary effects.  Some of them continue to be concerned that enough wringing-out hasn’t yet happened, that more risk-taking is still out there.  You were talking about the bears and the bulls, and I’m just wondering where you are.  Where do you think the balance of risk is here?  MR. KOS.  From a market perspective, that is the most interesting question.  I recall an exchange that President Fisher and I had a couple of meetings ago, when we were talking about the zloty and the Icelandic krona and whether that was sort of a precursor, perhaps the beginning of a longer phase of a downscaling of risk.  There might be something to be said for that.  We were in a lengthy period when investors were reaching for yield, and I’m not sure that two months is going to cleanse the system.  MS. MINEHAN.  It’s impossible to see these things beforehand, but everyone is nervous about the idea of crowded trades—what havoc they could cause.  Clearly, Iceland saw a bit of it.  than that we need to be conscious that problems could be out there.  MR. KOS.  I don’t want to speculate.  I don’t think my guess would be any better than anybody else’s.  Another view is that the markets that had been priced furthest from fair value are the ones that are adjusting, and a case can be made that, once they equilibrate, we shouldn’t have spillover effects.  Now it’s hard to know which way the scales will tip, but good cases can be made on both sides.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions for Dino?  If not, we need a vote to ratify open market transactions.  Motion?   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  We’ll turn now to the economic situation.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Many of the spending indicators   MR. SLIFMAN.2that we’ve received over the past few weeks have been coming in to the weak side of our expectations.  As you can see by comparing the red and blue striped bars in the top left panel of exhibit 1, in the Greenbook we responded to the weaker numbers by revising down our projection for second-quarter growth of real GDP to a 2 percent annual rate, about 1¾ percentage points less than in the May Greenbook.  We interpreted some of the unexpected softness as reflecting weaker underlying demand, and we let that part feed through beyond the current quarter as well.  But as I’ll discuss shortly, the softness of the spending data wasn’t the only factor leading us to temper our forecast for the out quarters.    A key component of the downward revision to the current quarter has been a slower-than-anticipated pace of consumer spending—the panel to the right.  Based largely on the available data for retail sales, motor vehicles, and the CPI, we estimate that real PCE in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of only 2.2 percent.  The slowing reflects a step-down in purchases of light motor vehicles as well as essentially flat real outlays for goods other than motor vehicles in the first two months of the quarter.    The other big surprise in the recent data is the sharper-than-expected drop-off in housing activity, as illustrated in the middle left panel.  Despite the May uptick in 2 The materials used by Messrs. Slifman, Wilcox, and Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). Thus, while many of the indicators of activity have lately been to the downside of housing starts, the levels of both starts and permits are well below where we thought they would be at the time of the last Greenbook.   been favorable.  For example, orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods, plotted to the right, continue to point to strengthening demand.  In addition, business spending for new structures, not shown, appears to have posted another sizable gain this quarter.  The scant data available for June do not suggest that the slowdown in spending earlier in the quarter has been cumulating.  As shown in the bottom left, initial claims for unemployment insurance, after retracing the rise that was associated with the effects of the temporary government shutdown in Puerto Rico, have remained in a range consistent with further moderate employment increases.  Meanwhile, as shown to the right, the Empire State and Philadelphia business surveys, which were less favorable in April and May, were considerably more positive this month.   our expectations, the news has not been entirely negative.  All told, we still see economic growth as being in a transition—to a pace somewhat below that of potential.  This can be seen in exhibit 2, which presents the longer-run outlook.  We now think that real GDP, as shown by the striped blue bars in the top left panel, will increase at a 2¾ percent rate in the second half of this year and through 2007.    As I mentioned earlier, several developments besides the incoming spending indicators influenced our thinking about the economic outlook.  First, revised data from the BEA now put the 2005:Q4 change in wage and salary disbursements, plotted by the black line in the top right panel, considerably below the figure published at the time of the last Greenbook, the red dashed line.  The reduction in labor income suggests less consumption going forward.  Regarding our assumption for monetary policy, the funds rate is assumed to be increased to 5¼ percent at this meeting and to remain there through the end of 2007.  As shown in the middle right panel, the Wilshire 5000 stock market index is about 7 percent below the level we had assumed in the May Greenbook.  We assume that equity prices will rise at a 6½ percent annual rate going forward—a pace that roughly maintains risk-adjusted parity with the returns on Treasury securities.  The latest reading on house prices from the OFHEO index, illustrated in the bottom left panel, was in line with our expectations.  We continue to expect an appreciable deceleration in house prices over the projection period.  Finally, after several Greenbooks in which we revised up our forecast of crude oil prices, this round we revised down our forecast.  When we prepared the Greenbook, the spot price of WTI was just under $70 per barrel, about $5 less than at the time of the May Greenbook.  And with futures prices also lower, we reduced the path of crude oil prices throughout the projection period.   illustrated in the top left panel, total real outlays for equipment and software, excluding the volatile transportation equipment component, are projected to increase Exhibit 3 presents some details of the outlook for business fixed investment.  As can see from the red portion that the bulk of the support comes from spending for high-tech equipment.    Much of the recent strength in the high-tech sector has reflected a spurt in capital spending for communications equipment by telecom service providers, whereas demand for servers and PCs, the top right panel, has faltered.  However, our forecast calls for real outlays for computing equipment to pick up later this year and to be sustained in 2007.  Industry analysts cite several upcoming technological developments that should boost demand for new servers and PCs.  These are summarized in the middle left panel.  With regard to servers, several manufacturers plan to offer new generations of servers this autumn that offer significantly faster computing power and, just as important, lower electricity consumption.  In addition to ongoing demand for large-scale servers from financial services companies, demand for clusters of small-scale servers—so-called server farms—by Internet content providers, for example, also appears to be robust.  With regard to PCs, Intel will be introducing a fundamentally new chip design in the second half of this year that reportedly will increase performance and significantly reduce power consumption.  With the new generation of chips on the horizon, prices on old chips have been plummeting.  We project that demand for PCs should step up later this year, spurred by the combination of the new generation of chips for high-end users and falling prices on old chips for middle- and low-end users.   The table to the right presents our forecast for real spending on nonresidential structures.  As shown in line 2, outlays for drilling and mining have been growing briskly.  Reflecting the sharp increases in prices of oil and natural gas over the past few years, the number of drilling rigs in operation, the bottom left panel, has been climbing steadily, with much of the increase for the natural gas component.  We see the growth of activity slowing somewhat next year as the prices of natural gas and crude oil begin to flatten.  Outside drilling and mining, investment in new buildings has strengthened recently, as vacancy rates (illustrated for office buildings by the black line in the bottom right panel) have been trending down and rents received by building owners (the red line) have been climbing.  That said, we think the current rate of investment growth is unsustainable, given our projection of decelerating employment and business sales, and consequently the growth rate of construction spending slows in our forecast.   Turning now to the household sector, the subject of exhibit 4, we expect real PCE, the red bars in the top left panel, to increase at a rate of about 3 percent in the second half of this year and to stay close to that pace in 2007.  The forecast reflects two important crosscurrents.  On the one hand, real income growth, the blue bars, is projected to be robust reflecting, in part, a waning drag from higher energy prices.  On the other hand, the wealth-to-income ratio, plotted by the black line in the top right panel, falls in our forecast as house prices decelerate.  With slower gains in wealth and rising interest rates, we expect that spending will be restrained relative to income and, accordingly, the saving rate will rise.  The remainder of the exhibit that sales of new homes and existing homes, the middle left panel, are well off their peaks, whereas backlogs of unsold homes, the panel to the right, have increased significantly.  In putting together the forecast, we factored in the recent data on starts, sales, and inventories, which led us to mark down the profile of activity throughout the forecast period.  All told, as shown in the bottom left panel, we expect that real residential investment spending will drop 5¼ percent this year and fall another 1¾ percent next year.    Widespread anecdotal reports suggest that the drop in demand is being driven partly by a withdrawal from the market by investors and purchasers of second homes.  Data on mortgage originations by investors and those purchasing second homes, which begin on a monthly basis in mid-2003 and are available only through March, are plotted to the right.  The first thing to note is that these groups are a relatively small part of the overall market.  Moreover, although the data are quite noisy, neither group, at least through March, was leaving the housing market in droves. Nevertheless, the recent spate of reports and a jump in the rate of contract cancellations for new homes, which homebuilders attribute largely to a retreat by investors, pose a downside risk to the housing outlook.    Another risk to the forecast is the possibility of a pronounced deterioration in the financial conditions of some vulnerable households, which could cause them to retrench significantly on spending.  As shown in exhibit 5 in the top left panel, the financial obligations ratio for homeowners has risen sharply over the past year or so.  It reached a record high in the second half of last year, and we estimate that it rose further in the first quarter of this year.  (As an aside, the rate for renters has actually been falling since mid-2001, though that could be changing.)  Some analysts have expressed concern about the high level of the financial obligations ratio—especially in light of the potential for further increases in obligations related to variable-payment mortgages, which represent more than one-fifth of all outstanding first-lien mortgages.  Nowadays, variable-payment mortgages typically carry a fixed interest rate for a few years before converting to floating-rate, and most aren’t scheduled for a payment change for some time.  The top right table presents some evidence. As you can see in the last column, the bulk of variable-rate mortgages—both ARMs and interest-only—that have yet to reprice won’t begin to reprice until after 2007.  Moreover, the end of the interest-only term for nearly all I-O mortgages that are awaiting the end of the I-O term is well in the future—line 3 of the table.    Given these patterns, scheduled mortgage payment changes should have only a limited effect on the aggregate mortgage burden—adding just a few tenths to the homeowners’ financial obligations ratio this year and next.  As a result, we have not seen—and don’t expect—a broad deterioration in mortgage credit quality.  For example, as shown in the middle left panel, delinquency rates for prime borrowers, who account for 85 percent of the mortgage market, have been relatively flat for some time—as illustrated by the black line.  That said, there are some indications of stress among subprime borrowers.  This group presumably is at greater potential risk for financial stress generally:  Note the higher levels of their delinquency rates, the red line, compared with the prime market.  In particular, we are seeing a deterioration among subprime borrowers with variable-rate mortgages—the red line in the panel to the right.  This type of loan is far more prevalent in the subprime market, representing about two-thirds of all subprime mortgages.  The fixed-rate period for subprime variable-rate loans is considerably shorter than that for prime loans—typically one or two years versus five to seven years—so more subprime borrowers with variable-rate mortgages are likely to see their monthly payments rise over the projection period.  And the increases for those subprime borrowers experiencing resets could be striking:  We estimate increases of something like 25 to 30 percent of their original payment.    More generally, households that are likely to be more financially vulnerable appear to have become decidedly more pessimistic.  The bottom left panel plots the Michigan consumer sentiment index stratified by income.  Consumer sentiment for both upper- and lower-income groups plunged last autumn.  Currently, both groups appear more concerned than they had been before mid-2005, but the lower third appears especially nervous.  Our baseline projection for the household sector incorporates these developments.  Nevertheless, the greater stress evident among the most financially vulnerable segment of the household sector presents a downside risk to the forecast.  David will now continue our presentation.  MR. WILCOX.  Exhibit 6 turns to the outlook for compensation.  The first column of the top left panel shows that recent readings on the productivity and cost measure of compensation have been quite choppy.  Increases in the employment cost index, shown in the right-hand column, have been smoother but have been puzzling in their own right, in that they have been running so low.  The two gauges differ methodologically in many respects, some of which are itemized in the panel to the right.  Despite their differences, both measures suggest that compensation pressures have remained subdued even as the labor market has tightened.  We expect that, over the projection period, resource utilization—represented in the middle left panel by the difference between the unemployment rate and our estimate of the NAIRU—will be only a small influence on compensation growth, boosting it a bit this year and restraining it slightly next year as the economy cools.  A larger influence on the outlook is represented in the right-hand panel:  As shown by the third pair of bars, real compensation has not kept pace with productivity during the past several years.  Between now and the end of next year, as shown by the rightmost pair of bars, we expect this situation to reverse and real compensation to increase a little more rapidly than productivity, as competition for scarcer workers causes past productivity gains and higher overall price inflation to feed into compensation.  As shown in the bottom left panel, the resulting increase in real compensation causes the markup of price over unit labor cost to decline slightly from its current historically high level and, as shown in the bottom right panel, causes both the ECI and compensation per hour to accelerate somewhat in nominal terms from well above its historical average, we think such increases in labor costs would not prompt new upward pressure on prices.  Exhibit 7 turns to the outlook for price inflation.  As shown in the middle column of the table in the top left, core PCE prices increased more quickly in March, April, and May than in the preceding two months, boosting our forecast for the increase in core prices in the second quarter as a whole to 3.1 percent at an annual rate.  As shown to the right, core inflation and its market-based component have tracked each other quite closely of late on a four-quarter basis and are projected to do so over the forecast period, suggesting no unusual mischief on the part of nonmarket prices.  We continue to expect core PCE inflation to ease back next year.  The major reason for this moderation is shown in the middle left panel; after bulging again this quarter, energy prices are expected to be roughly flat over the remainder of the projection period.  On our assumptions, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes, that flattening takes about ¼ percentage point off core PCE price inflation next year.  Several measures of inflation expectations are shown in the middle right panel.  As you know, consumers’ expectations backed off in early June, according to the University of Michigan survey, and TIPS-based inflation compensation has come down a bit as well in the past few weeks.  Nonetheless, as shown in line 5 of the table at the bottom of the page, the two CPI reports we have received since the May meeting boosted our estimate of core PCE inflation over the first half of this year 0.2 percentage point.  And as shown in the third and fourth columns, we have essentially carried that bad news forward despite the slightly greater amount of slack in the economy and the slightly lower profile of energy prices from here forward.  Exhibit 8 investigates whether the staff inflation models have been moving off track recently.  As you know, we consult a broad range of models, but to keep the discussion manageable, I will report on just two of those specifications.  As noted in the top panel, the first is a backward-looking model that uses lagged inflation to proxy for underlying or expected inflation.  The second specification is a partly forward-looking model that uses a weighted average of both lagged inflation and expected inflation as measured in the Survey of Professional Forecasters.  The bottom line from this exercise is that, although both models have certainly made sizable quarterly forecasting errors of late, neither has been substantially and consistently surprised by the performance of inflation over the past several years in a way that would signal an important structural shift.  The middle panels report on the performance of the backward-looking model.  The left-hand panel shows model simulations jumping off from several different points in the recent past.  As you can see, the simulation trajectories are at least broadly reminiscent of the actual data.  Nonetheless, it is difficult to determine with the naked eye whether the model errors have been predominantly to one side or the other.  As an aid in that diagnosis, the right-hand panel uses a technique known as the Kalman filter—a statistical method for allowing a parameter estimate to evolve over NAIRU.  Here’s the guide to interpreting the right-hand panel:  If this particular model agreed with the staff estimate of the NAIRU and if every other aspect of the model were correctly specified, the Kalman filter estimate would follow the same trajectory as the staff NAIRU.  And, in fact, that is pretty much what you see:  Like the staff estimate of the NAIRU, the Kalman-filter estimate declines noticeably from the early 1990s through the late 1990s and then flattens out.  Turning up the power on the microscope, you can see that even since the late 1990s the Kalman-filter estimate has been declining ever so slightly, signifying that inflation has been running just a little lower during the last eight years or so than the model would have expected.  The source of this surprise is not identified by the technique:  It could, in fact, be a the economic structure.  The bottom panels repeat the experiment for the partly forward-looking model.  Again, as you can see on the left, the model misses many of the finer points in the actual data but seems to capture at least the general drift, with errors roughly balanced to the high side and the low side.  Indeed, as shown to the right, the Kalman filter estimates in this case have moved essentially sideways since the late 1990s, indicating that the model has not been disproportionately surprised to one side or the other.  Exhibit 9 turns to the question of whether the recent increases in energy prices have been seeping into the structure of inflation more broadly and, if so, to what extent.  The top panel focuses on inflation at the producer level.  The panel compares the PPI for finished energy, the red line, with a staff-constructed aggregate of output price indexes for industries in which energy costs represent a relatively high share of total costs.  If energy-price pass-through were going to show up anywhere, it would be here.  And, as you can see, it does in fact show up.  Indeed, this may be the statistical counterpart of at least some of the anecdotes that you have been hearing about energy-price increases being passed on to customers.  On the other hand, you have also heard us report that pass-through at the consumer level has become much more muted.  The middle panel documents that claim.  For purposes of this exercise, we estimated the models for core PCE price inflation over rolling fifteen-year sample periods and then asked the models to tell us, based on those estimates, the predicted effect of a 10 percent increase in the relative price of energy on core PCE inflation after eight quarters.  As you can see, the point estimates have been lower in recent years.  The bullets in the bottom panel summarize our assessment of this evidence.  Currently in the judgmental forecast we assume that a permanent 10 percent increase in the relative price of energy would boost core inflation about 0.2 percentage point after eight quarters.  This assumption balances estimates derived from shorter sample periods—like the ones shown in the middle panel—against estimates derived from longer sample periods that include data from the 1970s and 1980s.  Our approach is pass-through have been a little surprised by how high inflation has been in the last few quarters.  On the other hand, models that assume a larger pass-through than the one we use judgmentally, consistent with the average experience over the past four assumption tucks us neatly in between.  Exhibit 10 focuses on the price of owner-occupied housing and its role in the formulation of monetary policy.  As noted in the top box, two main approaches to measuring the price of owner-occupied housing services have been outlined in the economics literature.  The first approach aims to measure the user cost of owner-occupied housing.  As shown in equation 1, the user cost depends on imputed interest expense, depreciation, and the expected capital gain.  For many years, this was essentially the approach that the BLS took to measuring the price of owner-occupied housing in the CPI, except that they ignored the expected capital gain component.  Increasingly, however, they and others became dissatisfied with the user-cost approach, partly because it ignored the capital gains component and partly because it guaranteed that an increase in interest rates would cause an increase in measured inflation.  Finally, in 1983, they shifted to the rental-equivalence approach which, as summarized in equation 2, aims to measure the rents that owner-occupants would charge themselves in an assumed arms-length transaction.  In a world in which all the relevant variables could be measured perfectly and house prices were always perfectly aligned with fundamentals, the two approaches would give the same answer, and equation 3 would hold.  That equation shows that rents can increase even if house prices—denoted as Pt—are decreasing.  Indeed, this would be expected to happen if interest rates—denoted as it—were increasing, all else being equal.  In the real world, rents could also diverge from house prices if the latter were coming down after a period of overvaluation.  Thus, the constellation of facts that we see today—a decelerating OFHEO price index together with an accelerating rent index in the CPI—may not be as anomalous as intuition might at first have suggested.  The last two bullets in the box address the role of housing prices in the conduct of monetary policy.  First, a broad range of analysts agree that something like owners’ equivalent rent (OER) is a theoretically appropriate element of a cost-of-living index.  But second, and of more direct to concern to you, whether the FOMC should define its objectives relative to a cost-of-living index that includes OER depends on what costs you are seeking to minimize in your conduct of monetary policy.  For example, to name just two possibilities, you may believe that the costs of deviations from price stability derive mainly from the inability of individuals to accurately take account of inflation in their long-term financial planning, in which case you might want to aim to stabilize an index of the overall cost of living, including OER.  On the other hand, you may believe that the costs of deviations from price stability have more to do with the misallocation of productive resources stemming from confusions between real and different from a cost-of-living index.  The bottom two panels turn to the operational question of more-immediate consequence—namely, what we expect to happen to rents in the near term.  As shown in the bottom left panel, housing affordability has deteriorated sharply during the past two years, suggesting that rents may come under considerable further upward pressure.  On the other hand, the rental vacancy rate, shown as the red line, remains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that any acceleration should be of moderate proportions.  On balance, as shown in the bottom right, we have carried forward some of the recent higher readings in these categories but have taken the moderate view, at least for now.  MR. KAMIN.  In contrast to the mixed news on economic activity coming out of the United States and despite the international financial volatility that Dino described, readings on foreign economic activity have been generally positive.  Importantly, some of the areas of the global economy that had been weak in previous years are showing signs of strength.  As indicated by the blue line in the top left panel of exhibit 11, euro-area industrial production has been moving up on balance in recent months, buoyed by solid manufacturing orders.  The consumer had been the laggard in the euro zone’s recovery; but retail sales have edged up, and the first-quarter data on German consumption (not shown) were quite encouraging.  In Japan, the middle panel, the rapid expansion that kicked in last year appears to be continuing:  As in the euro area, manufacturing orders and output have been quite strong.  And after generally disappointing growth for the past several years, Mexico’s economy, shown on the right, has accelerated on the back of strong manufacturing production, destined in large part for the United States.  These indications support our estimate that total foreign growth (line 1 in the middle panel) registered a healthy and broad-based 3½ percent in the current quarter.  To be sure, this represents a step-down from the exceptionally strong performance in the first quarter.  The deceleration was mainly in emerging market economies (line 7), particularly China and Mexico.  The Chinese government has taken several additional measures in recent months to slow investment, including restricting investment in certain sectors, raising down payments for real estate purchases, and tightening lending guidelines; we anticipate that these measures will finally bring overall growth down to a more sustainable pace.  Mexican GDP, having surged more than 6 percent in the first quarter, likely has cooled to a still-robust 3½ percent rate in the second.  Second-quarter growth in the industrial economies (line 2) is estimated to have shown a more muted decline from its first-quarter pace.  Canadian growth likely slowed along with the U.S. economy, but Japanese growth is estimated to have stayed strong while activity in the euro area and the United Kingdom accelerated.   Beyond the current quarter, we see growth in the emerging market economies holding steady while that of industrial economies moderates a bit further.  Lower U.S. economic growth will restrain demand.  Additionally, foreign economic activity will bottom left panel, which presents our projections for key foreign policy rates, although we believe the tightening cycle is winding down in Canada, it still has a way to go in the euro area, and it has yet to begin in Japan.  Finally, the recent sharp declines in global stock markets (the black and purple lines on the right) as well as the increase in emerging market credit spreads (the red line) will likely weigh on spending in both industrial and emerging market economies.  Were downdrafts in international financial markets to continue and to intensify, they could lead to sharp falloffs in activity.  For now, however, financial of previous steep run-ups and EMBI spreads remaining at historically low levels.  A few economies—especially Turkey, South Africa, and Hungary—remain under pressure, but this likely reflects their particular vulnerabilities rather than more generalized turmoil in emerging markets.  Accordingly, returning to the top line of the middle panel, total foreign growth is projected to make a smooth landing to its estimated trend rate of roughly 3¼ percent.  This “goldilocks” projection for the foreign economies hinges on our assessment that inflation will remain contained despite continued high commodity prices and diminishing slack.  As shown on the top left panel of exhibit 12, average inflation in the industrial economies is projected to move up a bit further in the current quarter but to then ease as the pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices into consumer prices is completed.  In the emerging economies, government policies tend to slow the response of domestic energy prices to those set in world markets; accordingly, inflation for these economies is not projected to peak until later this year, after which it also moves down.   As shown on the right, our projection, based on quotes from futures markets, is that prices of both West Texas intermediate crude oil and non-energy commodities will flatten out but stay elevated.  Oil prices have increased considerably faster than our import-weighted aggregate of non-energy commodity prices; but some non-energy prices, especially those of metals such as copper, have indeed moved up sharply over a short period of time.  The quarterly data plotted in the chart obscure the fact that, most recently, prices of metals and other commodities have moved back down, in part because of the same concerns about future monetary policies and growth that have weighed on financial markets.  The middle left panel shows spot prices for copper and zinc; although these have declined sharply, they remain extremely elevated.  Increases in demand have been an important driver of the overall rise in commodity prices in the past few years.  Some observers have taken this rise to be a signal that the global economy is overheating.  Indeed, as shown on the right, world GDP growth (the red dashed line) has been brisk in the past two years, and this growth does appear to be correlated with the rate of change of oil and other commodity prices.  Yet rising commodity prices are probably not so much a symptom Asia, particularly China.  As indicated in line 2 of the bottom left panel, China, by itself, has contributed 1½ percentage points to global economic growth in the past three years; moreover, of the total increase in world oil consumption (shown in line 3), increases in Chinese consumption (shown in line 4) accounted for more than one-quarter.  China’s contributions to global output growth appear to have been supported by corresponding increases in capacity.  CPI inflation excluding food, the solid line in the panel on the right, has remained quite low at around 1 percent recently.  Data on overall industrial capacity are not available, but we do have data for specific sectors.  The red cross-hatched bars in the panel indicate Chinese steel-making capacity, and the solid bars represent actual production.  China’s steel production has soared to 31 percent of total global output, but by dint of extraordinary levels of investment, capacity has risen even more.  Thus, rising commodity prices likely reflect sectoral bottlenecks in the midst of rapid Asian development rather than a more-generalized global overheating.  The top left panel of exhibit 13 focuses on resource utilization in the foreign industrial economies.  The solid black line represents the staff estimate of the output gap—that is, the excess of actual over potential GDP; it suggests that actual output in the industrial economies is now near but not significantly above potential.  The message that the industrial economies are not overheating is also supported by measures of capacity utilization rates in manufacturing, expressed as deviations from their ten-year averages; aside from Japan, capacity utilization rates in the major foreign industrial economies are close to historical levels.  It is not possible to construct reliable measures of potential output and of the output gap for the developing economies because the requisite data on stocks of labor and especially capital are not available.  Moreover, as these economies are undergoing rapid structural change, conventional output gap calculations would be doubly tenuous.  Measures of manufacturing capacity utilization are available for some developing economies, as shown on the right, and they point to declining levels of resource slack.  Whether overall GDP in these economies has moved up beyond potential, however, is difficult to say.  The middle panels present a mixed picture of recent inflation trends in three of our important trading partners.  In the euro area, twelve-month headline inflation (the solid black line) has edged up in recent months; however, both core inflation (the dotted red line) and wage growth (the blue dashed line) have stayed subdued.  In Canada, headline, core, and wage inflation have all been creeping up, although core inflation remains at only 2 percent.  In Mexico, notwithstanding rising global energy prices and accelerating wages, both headline inflation and core inflation have been trending down.  The bottom left panel shows unit labor costs.  Recent cost growth has been coming down from high levels in Canada and the United Kingdom, has been reasonably contained in France, and remains negative in Germany.  Finally, the right panel indicates that long-term inflation expectations in the foreign industrial economies excluding Japan—whether measured by bond market breakeven rates (the black line) or semiannual surveys (the red line) have remained around 2½ percent or below. upward pressures on foreign inflation, the data in hand appear to support the more benign scenario we have built into our outlook.  A second key risk to the outlook centers on the dollar.  As indicated in the top left panel of exhibit 14, the U.S. current account deficit reached nearly 2 percent of world GDP last year, balanced primarily by surpluses in Japan, emerging Asia, and especially the oil-exporting countries.  As shown on the right, the U.S. trade balance, while having recovered a bit from its plunge in the wake of Hurricane Katrina last fall, nevertheless remains on a deteriorating trend.  Market focus on external imbalances likely explains much of the  However, the market’s attention to global external imbalances appeared to fade by mid-May, and the dollar has moved up since then.  Neither the dollar’s decline nor its subsequent rebound could be explained by the differential between U.S. bond yields and foreign bond yields, shown on the right, which has moved little this year. The balance-of-payments data, shown in the bottom panel.  As shown in line 1, the current account deficit narrowed in the first quarter, reflecting a smaller nominal trade deficit, reduced transfers abroad, and an improved balance on investment income.  As for the financing of the deficit, private foreign purchases of U.S. securities, line 4, slowed sharply in April.  However, neither the good news about the deficit nor the potentially bad news about its financing had much of an effect on the dollar.  In projecting the future path of the dollar, we have wrestled with the usual tension between the need for the dollar to fall over the longer term to restore current account sustainability and the fact that in the shorter term the dollar can do pretty much whatever it wants.  Accordingly, as indicated by the black line in the top left panel of exhibit 15, in our Greenbook projection the broad real dollar depreciates only about 2 percent annually.  However, we are keenly aware that a refocusing of investor attention on sustainability could lead to a much steeper decline in the dollar.  This exhibit compares our baseline projection of the external sector with a simulation of the staff’s FRB/Global model in which the dollar declines an additional 15 percent over the next year and a half; this is the same simulation summarized in the International Developments section of the Greenbook.  As shown on the right, our baseline projection is for the trade balance to continue to deteriorate for the remainder of this year but to flatten out a bit next year as oil prices top out and the slowing of U.S. growth takes effect.  Because of J-curve effects, the path of the nominal trade balance is roughly similar under the alternative simulation, at least during the forecast period.  However, the additional depreciation leads to declines in real imports and increases in real exports.  Accordingly, as shown in the next row, the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth, which is negative for most of next year in the baseline, becomes positive under the alternative simulation.  A more-rapid depreciation of the dollar would affect prices as well as output.  As shown on the right, in our baseline projection, core import price inflation—which we additional dollar depreciation in the alternative simulation adds 2 to 3 percentage points to core import inflation over the forecast period.  As shown in the next row, core PCE inflation rises about ¼ percentage point, reflecting both the higher import prices and brisker economic activity.  Accordingly, the Taylor rule in the model leads the federal funds rate to rise above 6 percent by the end of next year.  This squeezes domestic consumption and investment somewhat and, as a result, real GDP growth in the alternative simulation rises a bit less than does the contribution of net exports to GDP.  Notably, foreign growth declines a bit less than U.S. growth rises.  In sum, we view a sharp decline in the dollar as unpredictable but entirely possible.  Such an event likely would lead to more U.S. growth but also more inflation and a need for tighter monetary policy than currently incorporated into the Greenbook forecast.   MR. SLIFMAN.  The final exhibit presents your forecasts for 2006 and 2007.  Compared with February, you have edged down your projections for the growth of real GDP in both years and raised your forecast of core inflation.  The forecast for the unemployment rate is essentially unchanged.  That concludes our presentation, and we will be happy to answer any of your questions.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any questions for our colleagues?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I have some more questions about latent variables.  During my exchange   with David at the last meeting, I was asking about inflation expectations.  I learned that you didn’t have a single number for expected inflation but that there were multiple measures.  You offered to write a number down on an envelope for me but cautioned me against placing too much reliance on it.  You went on to say that there was something called “underlying inflation,” and you spent a good deal of time talking about this.  You even cited some numbers—said that it was maybe 1 percent or 1½ percent in ’03 and that it had risen perhaps to 2 percent at the last meeting.  So I went and checked my New Palgrave: Dictionary of Economics.  I couldn’t find “underlying inflation.”  [Laughter]  I went to the BLS website and the BEA website; it wasn’t there either.  I asked some of my theoretical economists if they had seen any papers in the literature that have models with underlying inflation, and I couldn’t find anything.  So I’m wondering what it is.  I’m wondering what the number is now, how it has changed since May, about inflation policy.  MR. STOCKTON.  I’ll jump in, given that it looks as though you’re still looking at me.  [Laughter]  This may either dismay you or encourage you.  I wasted a great deal of staff time in the past four or five weeks actually asking our folks whether or not they could create a measure that would be useful to you, verifiable, and auditable.  We haven’t yet concluded that the answer is “no,” but the task is very complicated, in part because our forecast, to a great extent, is a pooling exercise that encompasses a large number of models.  David showed in his presentation today two of those models—one that uses just lagged price inflation and another that uses a combination of a weighted average, in some sense, of lagged price inflation and expected inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.  We are also looking at models that use the Michigan survey and that use TIPS spreads.  The question is, Is there some sort of latent concept in there that would be useful to you?  Underlying inflation is a sense of both momentum and expectations because there are costs of adjustment associated with inflation and there are forward-looking expectations.  When I was talking about underlying inflation, I was talking about the convolution of both of those two concepts.  The figures I cited are very rough—they are based on a sort of decomposition of how much we can explain by what’s been going on with slack in resource utilization, productivity changes, energy prices, import prices, and a variety of other things.    As I said, I could certainly write those down for you.  But I have come to the view that perhaps the better thing to do is to be clear about what the raw inputs are that go into the forecast.  I think we could expand the material that we’re presenting in the Greenbook to include such things as the lagged price component that might be in essence inflation momentum or recent observations uses the Survey of Professional Forecasters but in history is concatenated with the Hoey survey that we had in the early 1980s and before that a time-series technique that Sharon Kozicki and Peter Tinsley developed for us to incorporate when we estimate the longer-term model.  I could picture us doing a better job of actually showing you what the pieces are that we struggle with and pool together in coming up with a forecast.  To my mind, that would be more useful than giving you a number.  You might look at a number and think, well, it changed two-tenths, so the staff must think this or that.  In this pooling exercise, any number, given the standard errors associated with these various models, would give “underlying inflation” a level of precision and importance in your thinking that it shouldn’t have.  I’d rather provide you with the inputs that I think will be helpful in giving a sense of what we’re looking at and what’s conditioning our thinking about the inflation outlook.  So, again, we are still looking at this question.  With the natural rate of unemployment, for example, we can tell you what three coefficients in our estimated models go into producing the estimate there and can calculate standard errors and provide you with confidence intervals.  That’s a lot harder to do in this exercise with models with such diverse estimates of inflation expectations and the momentum of cost of adjustment.  I think we can do a better job.  I think we owe it to you to give you more than we currently are giving you.  I’m still of the view, after having looked at this for another four or five weeks, that giving you a number on an envelope might be a greater disservice to the Committee than a service to the Committee.  So I hope we can improve the quality of the analysis without necessarily providing you with some false level of precision or accuracy in this estimate. MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much, David.  I’m glad to hear that you’ve devoted so much staff time to this, and I appreciate the effort.  That number—expected inflation—isn’t the objective.  As you know, inflation dynamics are central to what we do.  There is significant scientific uncertainty about how policy interacts with those dynamics—in particular at times like the past several months, when inflation expectations appeared to fluctuate substantially—and there must be some interplay between our policy choices, communications, expected inflation, and realized inflation.  I was just looking for more insight into the staff’s accumulated wisdom on these topics and was taking that expected inflation number as a thread to pull on to try to elicit more visibility.  MR. STOCKTON.  Well, we can give you a bunch of threads, and I hope you’ll be able to weave them together.  [Laughter]  MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  I have one separate question for David Wilcox.  In exhibit 9, “Pass-Through of Energy Prices,” the middle panel reports on some empirical work.  When I try to find the counterpart in the model economy for the empirical exercise you do, it’s hard to picture it not having embedded within it a policy reaction function.  So I wonder, are you happy with our interpreting these numbers as measures of our credibility in some sense, or do you have changes relating to this consideration over time?  I mean, isn’t that what you’re measuring here?  MR. WILCOX.  You’re entirely right.  Both of these models are very partial equilibrium in their extent.  That’s especially true of the backward-looking model, which is strictly a reduced-form specification that takes no explicit account of inflation expectations.  But even the partly forward-looking model doesn’t have a sort of satellite equation that describes either the way expectations are formed or the conduct of monetary policy.  So, yes, I’m absolutely certain monetary policy, among other factors.    It’s partly for that reason, as I mentioned in the text, that in our judgmental assumption we haven’t taken on board these point estimates literally.  Our judgmental assumption is that, with this metric, a 10 percentage point increase in the relative price of energy would boost core PCE inflation 0.2 percentage point.  So, as you can see, that’s just a little to the high side of the range.   Now, I could produce other models at yet more expense in terms of staff time that probably would encompass even that.  Certainly, the standard errors would well encompass that 0.2 of the assumption.  But that’s just a way of illustrating that we discounted a bit the point estimates from these models because we don’t think the right message for you to take away is that, somehow, something has changed in the structure of the economy so that, in your conduct of monetary policy, you don’t need to respond to changes in energy prices.  Part of the reason that these numbers may be as low as they are is precisely because the Committee, over the past couple of decades, has responded forcefully to energy-price shocks and kept inflation in check.  MR. LACKER.  Well, more broadly, if we’re not to take these as exogenous because they reflect some public sense of our reaction function, we could strive to make them zero—that is to say, to view these kinds of coefficients as something we’re going to influence over time.  MR. WILCOX.  I suppose that would be a policy choice available to you.  In thinking about how to do that, you’d want to think about the horizon at which you would want to do this.  I sliced into probability space at a horizon of eight quarters.  I have no idea whether you’d want to aim to cause these shocks to have zero effect after four quarters or sixteen quarters or when.  But I haven’t thought seriously about whether precisely zero is the right effect or not.  The effect not statistically significantly different from zero.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is that a two-handed intervention? MS. MINEHAN.  Whatever.  [Laughter]  I forget the code here, but just a little intervention there?  It may be that the effect of oil-price increases on inflation is lower than it was two or three decades ago.  But, say, over the past two years, 2004 to 2006, given that we’ve had a number of oil shocks, if you want to call the oil-price increases that—I don’t know if they all achieve the meaning of “shock”—would you say that one of the key reasons, if not the key reason, for the increase in core inflation over that period is energy prices?  It seems to me that makes a difference because, if we think energy prices are going to subside, we can have a little more confidence about the falloff of inflation going forward.  If the increase isn’t mostly related to energy, then I think we can have less confidence of a falloff of inflation going forward.  MR. WILCOX.  There are many ways to do this accounting.  But on one accounting, the falloff that we have in core inflation in 2007 relative to 2006 is due entirely to the cessation of the indirect effect of energy prices passing through into the core.  If you look at the top right panel of exhibit 7, you can see that core prices in 2003 got down to a very low rate of increase.    MS. MINEHAN.  I remember that. MR. WILCOX.  A substantial part of the pickup since then by our calculation is due to the energy-price pass-through.  My recollection is that it’s on the order of 0.6 or 0.7 percentage point.  MS. MINEHAN.  That’s part of what we’re thinking it was.  A lot of this recent uptick in core is due pretty much to energy.  MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the staff for the global presentation, particularly for the beginning of this analysis on resource utilization, which as you know I find useful.  It is noteworthy that we’re beginning a process or, maybe, continuing a process and have not enough information yet to understand or to analyze it in terms of Chinese capacity.  Your striking figure in exhibit 12 about steel production and steel capacity—China now has 31 percent of the world’s capacity.  I would imagine that you’re going to see that in shipbuilding and several other sectors as we go through time.  So I want to thank you for the analysis.  Thank you, Karen, as well.  The question I have is this:  If you go to exhibit 11 and look at your forecast for the second half of 2006 and for 2007 for the emerging economies, what’s striking about these numbers at the bottom right-hand side of the table is that they are occurring as we forecast a slowing in the U.S. economy.  I wonder if you might comment on the linkages between the two or on what other work we have to do on that front.  One would think that either emerging-market GDP would slow by virtue of our slowing or that they would build up their own domestic consumption.  And I’m wondering about the interrelationship we build into our models between the two.  Again, thank you for the analysis.     MR. KAMIN.  My pleasure.  We’re keenly aware of the fact that the United States economy plays a leading role in the global economy.  During the last downturn, at the beginning of this decade, when the U.S. economy started to slow, our European colleagues often said, “Well, we’re probably not going to experience a slowdown ourselves because our exports to the United States, as a fraction of our GDP, are relatively small.”  But, in the event, they did slow down because the United States economy affects the world not only through direct trade links certainly trades with other economies that do trade with the United States.  Their economies are also affected through financial channels.  Clearly, many financial markets turned down at the beginning of this decade as they are turning down now, albeit now to a lesser degree.  So we’re keenly aware that a slowdown in the U.S. economy would affect the world economy.   Now, we are not building in a very sharp slowdown for the world economy because we think that the conditions don’t merit that at this time.  In the emerging-market economies, the fundamentals are really quite strong except in certain economies that are under a lot of pressure.  In the industrial economies, two of the main areas—the euro area and Japan—had been weak in the past and are strengthening now.  So, as I say, we don’t see a sharp slowdown as the most likely outcome, although there is a risk of that.  At the same time, it’s important to note that we are building in a moderate slowdown for the total world economy, from about 4 percent in the second half of 2005 and the first quarter of this year to about 3¼ percent by the end of the forecast period.  It may not sound like a great deal, but when you aggregate the entire world economy, a percentage point change is more meaningful than it might be for an individual economy.  So we’re very aware of the linkages between the United States and the rest of the world and feel we have taken those into account.   MR. FISHER.  If I could just rephrase the question—is it reasonable to assume that the emerging economies that you list would maintain these rates were we to slow down significantly?   MR. KAMIN.  Do you mean would they slow down more than is embedded in our baseline forecast?   MR. FISHER.  Right. significantly greater degree than embodied in the baseline forecast, probably many economies, particularly the Asian economies that depend on us very heavily for their export markets, would indeed slow down much more than we are anticipating at this time.   MS. JOHNSON.  It’s not a straightforward thing to calculate in some sense.  The world does seem to have two engines instead of one.  That is to say, we would argue strongly that the global experience in the late 1990s would not provide a clear, accurate benchmark for what we would think today.  China, in particular, has reached a status and an independence from the United States that wasn’t present in the 1990s, and to the extent that it has achieved a certain dynamic in domestic demand, in a reorientation of production in Asia that has very closely linked those economies with China, the Chinese economy has, if you will, a momentum or a dynamic to it that is not totally dependent on the United States and so could, indeed, continue to grow rapidly if the U.S. economy were to slow.   Nonetheless, forecasting what will happen is a bit more of an art than a science because to some degree, for example, investment in these economies, while it is measured as a component of domestic demand, is undertaken with an eye toward export sales.  So the interactions of consumer confidence, of prospects for exports, and of relative price changes that shift the terms of trade for some of these economies all have to be factored into the projection, and I’m sure we don’t get it precisely right by any means.  But I would just say that, at the present time, the extent to which other sources of strength are arising in different parts of the global economy is, we think, an accurate representation, say, in comparison with ten years ago.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Moskow. on steel since President Fisher mentioned exhibit 12 and you showed this big increase in China’s steel capacity in ’05—much greater than the annual steel production increase—and I have heard about this a lot.  But steel prices in the United States are staying surprisingly high according to industry observers, and they are expected to go higher this year.  I was just wondering if you could shed some light on what’s happening to the price of steel. The other question I have is broader.  It’s really about the overall forecast.  This is one of the largest midyear revisions to the forecast that I remember seeing since I’ve been here, in the GDP numbers particularly.  Clearly, some of the data that have come in have been softer, but it seems to be more than just that.  There seems to be a change in the tone of the Greenbook that suggests some reassessment of the underlying strength of the economy.  That is the way I read it.  But you know, there is some good news here, too.  Productivity growth remains solid.  Real interest rates are just in the middle of the neutral zone.  Anecdotes I hear are really quite positive.  So I felt a disconnect when I read the Greenbook, and I was just wondering if you could elaborate on this a bit to help me understand this change in tone of the Greenbook.   MR. KAMIN.  I will answer the small question.  Then Larry can answer the big one.  [Laughter]  I agree with you that there is actually a certain disjuncture, if you will, between the fact that steel prices have stayed up and the growing capacity in China.  I don’t have a full answer to your question, but I would offer just a couple of thoughts.  The first is that, unlike a homogeneous primary commodity, steel comes in many forms, and there are different markets.  So the very substantial increases in Chinese capacity in some products don’t necessarily lead to price declines in other products that may be particularly important to the United States.  The second point to mention, which is much more obvious, is that iron ore prices actually have gone up very significantly.  year earlier.  What seems to be going on is some tension between increases in ore prices, on the one hand, and improvements in capacity, on the other hand, which might reduce the margin between the ore and the final steel products.  Perhaps those circumstances will go some way toward explaining the anomaly.   MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you.   MR. SLIFMAN.  Let me start, and then Dave may want to add a few comments as well.  Clearly, we did revise down the forecast.  The downward revision was based in part, as I said in my briefing, not only on the incoming data but also on some of the other factors that I highlighted in exhibit 2.  But I also want to emphasize that the news wasn’t uniformly bad as it came in.  Some good news came in as well, which I tried to point out.  What we have done is to take down the rate of growth roughly ½ percentage point beginning in the third quarter and moving to the end of the projection period, in large part, I’d say, because of the disappointing developments in the housing sector but because of other things, such as weaker consumption news, as well.  I would also say that we don’t see this cumulating.  We’ve weakened the forecast, but we don’t see the economy falling apart.  We continue to see an economy that, as I said, was in a transition to a rate of growth that will be below potential.  We just marked it down further below potential than we had in the last Greenbook.  But I don’t think that there’s a disconnect between what we’ve done and the news that we have received.  I do not know, Dave, if you have additional comments.   MR. STOCKTON.  It’s a big revision, and as you can imagine, we agonized a lot about “isn’t this is a big revision for just six weeks of information.”  The problem we confronted was that, if just the incoming data had been worse than we thought, we would not have made a revision as large as this.  But in each case, the weakness in the data was being reinforced by weaker readings in of weak numbers.  We lost $60 billion worth of income in downward revisions in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and we’re starting out with a much lower saving rate than we thought.  The stock market when we closed the Greenbook was off 7 percent.  Those were big fundamentals.  And housing, for the most part, continued to come in worse than we thought:  Although new home sales came in a bit above our expectations, starts were below what we had in May, and the permits were continuing to come down.  Even in this forecast, we basically have housing activity not declining a whole lot further in terms of housing starts going forward from where they are today.  So we could see some downside risks still to that.  If you ask where I think some of the vulnerabilities might be and how we could get to week we could get 200,000 on payroll employment with some upward revisions.  We could get a strong retail sales report for June with a little upward revision.  This is all going to look a bit as though we overreacted.  Things weren’t so strong.     But in each case it was not as though we had actual data or fundamentals that we could hold onto to tell us not to revise as much as we did.  So we thought we had things reasonably well balanced in this case.  I could see more downside risks than upside risks to our housing forecast.  The risks around our consumption forecast look pretty balanced to me.  On the one hand, given how low the saving rate is and some recent weakening in employment growth, I could see how things could come in lower.  On the other hand, it is easy to see that the consumer has been more resilient in recent years and could continue to be so.  So I see the risks there as more balanced.  On the business-sector side, however, I probably see a little more upside risk than downside risk to the forecast.   In the end, we felt as though we were compelled by our normal analytical apparatus to produce a forecast that was noticeably weaker than the last time, even though the revision looks big and showing a forecast that changed as much in such a short time certainly made us very nervous.  So I think you are right to be a bit taken aback by how much we revised in a short period; however, I still think the forecast probably has both upside and downside risks to it.   MR. MOSKOW.  It is very different from what I am hearing from people.   MR. STOCKTON.  I want to reinforce a little of what Larry said.  In this forecast, growth is just a bit below potential, there is a modest rise in the unemployment rate over the next six or seven quarters in the context of interest rates that have increased considerably and a fiscal policy that was swinging from considerable stimulus to some restraint.  Industrial production is continuing to increase at a reasonably solid pace.  So I don’t view this forecast as telling a cyclical weakening story to any great extent.  It’s just a softening to below trend.  That may still be inconsistent with the anecdotes you’re hearing.  Certainly in the industrial sector, in nonresidential construction, and even in business fixed investment, the anecdotes out there do sound quite positive at this point.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  This is a question for Steve or for Karen.  In Monday’s international briefing you referred, and I’ll quote, to the possibility that we may be “nearing limits on global capacity” when you were discussing foreign inflation prospects.  I’m really following up on President Fisher’s question here.  I want just to clarify what your thinking is about how global capacity figures into those foreign inflation forecasts that you make and then potentially into U.S. inflation.  One model might be that inflation in each country depends mainly on the country’s own domestic capacity or unemployment along with some role for import prices.  If so, you might refer to global capacity as just an average of the states of foreign labor markets, possibly driven by some might feel that there is some role for global capacity in the inflation process above and beyond how it may affect import prices.  That’s, I guess, the view that President Fisher has put forward, and it is interestingly endorsed in the BIS annual report that came out yesterday. MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, it certainly is. MS. YELLEN.  I mean, this is a large topic, but I don’t mean to ask too large a question.  I just want to clarify what your thinking is, especially when you use that term. MS. JOHNSON.  Why don’t I give an overview?  Then Steve can speak a bit about where we think we are.  The topic has obviously become of great interest.  It’s cropping up in any number of places, including the BIS.  When we think about it, the first problem we confront is that we were never able in the simpler world of ten years ago or so to get Phillips curves that were the least bit acceptable for almost any foreign industrial country you could name.  There was always great tension in international meetings, in research efforts, in conversations that we would have with central bank staff in some of these countries, and so forth to reconcile the way we thought about inflation and the forces driving inflation because they didn’t think in terms of slack and price pressures.  If you go back far enough, obviously they had a lot of faith, somehow, in money growth or medium-term things.  The OECD has tried often—indeed, people on my staff have tried often—to identify roles for gaps, in many of the European countries anyway.  These things we call speed effects—which indicate that what matters is how fast you’re changing (not whether you have a lot of slack in resources but how quickly are you closing that gap)—always seemed to loom large in certain countries, and effects of gaps were very hard to find.  For example, the whole period of Japanese deflation defies explanation in terms of a Phillips curve that has any kind of reasonable properties, or the deflation would have gotten worse and worse and worse over a long period of normally think about it and inflation were never strong and never commonly shared across a range of countries. Now we add a level of complexity in that we have a more-globalized economy.  We have had what amounts to a big, positive supply shock of labor, at the very least via the China-India-former Soviet Union line of reasoning, and suddenly people are now making arguments and estimating equations in which a global capacity measure is behaving better than I could ever find individual capacity measures to apply in these countries.  It leaves me in a bit of a quandary. I was in Basel over the weekend.  The BIS released its annual report in time for its annual general meeting, and I was lucky enough to find myself seated at lunch next to the authors of some of the work.  I said, “You know, I can’t imagine a variable that really captures what I think of as the range of effects that something like China might have and China’s labor force might have on the process of pricing in the global economy.  You have this paper that you’ve written, and it’s reflected in the annual report, and you have five different measures . . .”  He basically replied that they haven’t solved that problem and that the measures they used, in and of themselves, could readily be criticized, but they got some results.  He swore to me that they had beaten on this equation with every possible negative rationale that would explain it other than being valid, and it still kept coming back at them as though something was there. So I guess I am prepared now to look a little harder and try some of this ourselves, which we have been pretty skeptical about doing.  But there’s a big gap between the notion that there are 800 million Chinese who might potentially be engaged in global economic activity and the reality of what’s determining prices in real time today.  The fact that these people are potentially there but are difficult to think that one has captured something.  So I am certainly sympathetic with the notion that there are key bottlenecks—there are some features through the commodity markets or there are some other aspects within manufacturing in particular sectors where you see global capacity effects.  But disentangling the relative price pieces of this story from something that might relate to the interaction of overall capacity and inflation is very, very difficult.  I think we’re just beginning to do that.  In terms of this outlook, Steve may want to make a few comments about where we think we see global growth and how that might matter. MR. KAMIN.  Just to extend Karen’s remarks a bit—as Karen suggested, we have for quite a while had a certain amount of difficulty identifying a standard Phillips curve relationship between domestic output gaps and inflation in all foreign economies.  We have done research in our division over the past few years, and we actually have identified various types of relationships between gaps and inflation in many industrial economies.  They tend to differ from economy to economy.  In some, an output gap will matter; in others, a change in an output gap will matter.  So there really isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach toward predicting inflation in the foreign economies, and we don’t use one.  We use different approaches in different economies tailored as to what seems to work. So based on that, in terms of asking what particular concept of capacity underlies the statements in our briefing on Monday, the answer is that it’s one that does not take a stand on your particular issue.  It depends on the economy.  I should say we are, as Karen suggested, very aware of the work that the BIS has done, which shows extraordinarily important effects of the global output gap measure on domestic inflation rates.  As Karen pointed out, that work has quite a few conceptual flaws in terms of how one really measures the output gap in economies where that seems to indicate that the equations themselves, depending on the time period and the definition of the left-hand-side dependent variable, are not quite as robust as their authors suggested.  So we very much leave open the possibility that some measure of global capacity may, indeed, be important, but we are very far from being able to pin that effect down. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Quickly, just as an extension to President Moskow’s question—if you look at the economic projections, particularly for 2007, the staff’s forecast is sort of low on GDP, middling to high on core PCE, but right up there over the central tendency on the unemployment rate.  I think this comes under the heading of the surprise in this staff forecast versus what we’ve been seeing earlier this year.  And I’m telling the truth here:  I think our projections in Boston were closer to yours than what I see here in the central tendencies.  So it’s not that I’m objecting tremendously to your forecast, but one element I did find a little off-putting and I wanted to ask a question about is the relationship of how much your unemployment rate rises, going up from 4.6 to 5.2, to the path of the GDP forecast, even recognizing that it’s ½ percentage point slower than an earlier forecast.  That may be not your starting point.  I recognize that.  But it does seem like a big change even given the slower pace of GDP growth. MR. WILCOX.  We’ve had an error in Okun’s law in the levels relationship between the output gap and the unemployment rate gap.  The predominant explanation for what you’re talking about is that we have the relationship between the output gap and the difference between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU coming back into normal alignment.  Let me try to put that into English.  At the moment we have an output gap that we think is just closed, but we have an just stayed where it is right now, we would expect the unemployment rate–NAIRU combination on average to come back into normal alignment.  So we would get some lift in the unemployment rate just out of that, as that abnormal alignment works out of the system. MS. MINEHAN.  And is that what is pulling down inflation?  Is that having an effect on your core PCE? MR. WILCOX.  As I mentioned earlier, the predominant thing that’s causing core PCE to utilization is a tiny influence at this point. MS. MINEHAN.  So you’re basically agnostic about the output gap—or the lack thereof— and what you see in the current unemployment rate.  You don’t believe it because it’s out of whack with where you think it ought to be vis-à-vis the NAIRU? MR. WILCOX.  I’m not sure I’d use the word “agnostic.”  We think that both the output gap and the unemployment rate gap are pretty small.  Given how flat the Phillips curve is, we think they’re very slight influences on the performance of inflation over the remainder of this year and next, and we think other factors are going to loom larger in pushing inflation either up or down from where it is now. MR. STOCKTON.  Two other interpretations of the recent readings:  One interpretation is that Okun’s law is off and we’ll get some increase in the unemployment rate.  Another possibility is that the NAIRU is lower than we’re estimating.  In that case there would be no gap in the unemployment rate:  4.7 percent might equal the 4.7 on the natural rate, and the output gap would be zero.  That obviously has, as we have illustrated in the Greenbook, beneficial implications for inflation going forward and probably will produce a lower inflation forecast.  A second alternative is unemployment rate with less GDP growth.  If that were the case going forward, obviously it would imply higher future inflation.  Again, within the normal errors of Okun’s law—despite its name “law,” it’s a pretty loose empirical relationship [laughter]—we don’t really see it necessarily calling into question our estimates yet.  But I do think there are reasonable alternative interpretations of what’s happened recently to the ones that we are providing in the Greenbook. MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.  The second one would make inflation a little stickier. MR. STOCKTON.  Right. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if we could, I would like to start the economic go-round.  If at all possible, I would like to complete that today so everyone could get a chance to speak today.  Remember we have a two-handed intervention:  If you’d like to make a comment or ask a question, please raise two hands.  Otherwise, one hand puts you in the queue for your comment.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic growth in the Fifth District eased off the throttle a bit since our last meeting.  Our June manufacturing survey released yesterday morning continued to show nearly flat activity.  Indexes for shipments and new orders were barely positive, essentially unchanged from May, and down from strong readings for March and April.  The service sector, on the other hand, continues to display solid growth, with overall services revenues right on their three-month average and retail sales rebounding after a dip in May.  However, our big-ticket index, which is dominated by car sales, remained weak.  Employment indexes for both services and manufacturing were positive in June, with a slight decline in the services sector but a substantial gain in manufacturing.  District housing markets remained reasonably strong.  Sales and construction activity have continued to slip from last year’s levels in many areas, but our contacts construction activity.  Price pressures remain elevated in the Fifth District, and expectations for manufacturing price trends during the next six months remain about where they have been since last fall, roughly 3 percent for prices paid and 2 percent for prices received.  In the services sector, expected price increases for the next six months exceeded 3½ percent for the second month in a row, setting a new record high for this twelve-year-old index. Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook presents, as President Moskow noted, a distinctly different picture from six weeks ago, perhaps most notably with regard to consumer spending.  Lower growth of household income since the middle of last year has led the staff to reduce its estimate of the level of real disposable income this quarter 1 percent, and they have reduced their estimate of consumption this quarter 0.4 percent.  The Greenbook also marks down consumption growth ½ percent in the second half of ’06 and ¼ percent in ’07.  Now, it is certainly reasonable to expect lower current income to affect current consumption expenditures, but I am inclined to revise my outlook for consumption growth by less than the Greenbook.  Growth in real disposable income is forecast to bounce back in the second half.  So the first-half decline looks more like a permanent reduction in the level of income than a permanent reduction in the growth rate of income.  I would have expected a corresponding effect on the path of consumption, a one-time reduction in the level, with less of a reduction in forecast growth rates.  The same reasoning for me applies to the downward revision that has been made to current household wealth. This quibble aside, the outlook for the real side of the economy is softer than at the time of our last meeting, but it still strikes me as broadly consistent with sustained growth fluctuating around a trend near 3 percent.  True, housing market activity has fallen more rapidly since the last fallen outside a range that at the beginning of the year would have seemed plausible.  While the recent weaker-than-expected employment reports suggest slower job growth going forward, the Greenbook employment forecast seems reasonably well aligned with demographic and labor force participation trends.  So on the whole, I would say that, despite the recent evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information, the real side of the forecast does not seem out of the ordinary or terribly unsatisfactory to me. The inflation picture, on the other hand, does stand out and demand some attention.  We have just seen our worst three-month performance on the core CPI in more than eleven years, 3.8 percent, and the core PCE numbers are likely to be equally unfavorable.  I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that special factors, such as owners’ equivalent rent, do not excuse recent CPI behavior.  Fortunately for us, inflation expectations have declined recently.  The survey measures and TIPS spreads have moderated somewhat since our last meeting.  Still, inflation expectations appear to be fluctuating around a level suggesting PCE inflation above 2 percent.  Moreover, the Greenbook forecast now has year-over-year core PCE inflation remaining at 2.2 percent throughout the forecast period.  To me this forecast is unacceptable. To forecast a bulge to 2½ percent followed by a return to below 2 percent, as the Greenbook used to earlier this year, is one thing, but a plan for core inflation of more than 2 percent a year and a half from now is another thing entirely.  Surely in an eighteen-month period we can improve that outcome, but I will leave until tomorrow a discussion of our policy options.  For now I just want to note that recent events provide some striking evidence that I think is likely to have an important bearing on our strategy in the near term. to incoming news by marking up expected inflation and marking down the expected policy path, which I took as evidence of instability in market participants’ views about our intentions regarding inflation.  Similar instability was evident in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as well.  Since the last meeting, increases in the expected policy path have coincided with communications by the Committee via statements, minutes, speeches, and interviews.  This was documented in this week’s Board briefings. The same appears to be true of reductions in expected inflation, I think.  I take this recent history as evidence that expectations regarding inflation and the conduct of monetary policy are to a significant extent forward-looking and can be influenced by our communications.  As I pointed out earlier this year, the extent to which expectations are viewed as forward-looking or backward-looking could well influence the desirability of various policy options, especially how ambitious one wants to be about bringing inflation back in line.  I also take the recent history as suggesting the importance of clarifying the public’s understanding of how we intend to conduct policy, even if we cannot provide definitive advance guidance about the numerical value of future policy rate settings.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation has increased.  Clearly the inflation data are disappointing, but let me first focus on economic growth.  Here the key question is how much of the second-quarter weakness is transitory and how much represents a more fundamental softening in activity.  So with regard to the consumer, we share the Greenbook’s assessment that increases in consumer expenditures will recover somewhere close to a rate of 3 percent in the second half of this year.  Qualitatively, this seems to be the assessment of our contacts as well.  One, a major builder and operator of shopping malls throughout the United States, said that retailers at malls have been quite pleased with the first five months of the year.  Although they are expecting slower growth in the second half, they did not think that the falloff would be very large.  The automakers report that the year as a whole around 16.6 million or 16.7 million units, which means they expect the second half of the year to be similar to the first half.  This was also the consensus of the twenty-four industry analysts at our annual Automotive Outlook Symposium that we held last month. Looking at the fundamentals, like the Greenbook we think that growth in real income will be adequate to support the projected pace of spending.  Under the baseline path for oil prices, energy prices should turn from a negative to a neutral factor for real income growth, though this is certainly an area of great uncertainty.  Also, tight labor markets should eventually generate somewhat larger increases in wages, which should help offset the effects on overall income growth of somewhat slower gains in employment.  Here I should note that we do not think that the recent slowdown in job growth is the start of a deterioration in the labor market.  Our contact at Manpower studied this issue recently in response to skeptical Wall Street analysts who thought that the labor major markets and found no signs of cutbacks in hiring plans by his customers, and his business continues to grow at a modest pace.  Given our view of the trends in participation rates and other factors, we think that the 100,000 per month gains in payroll employment that we have seen over the past couple of months are consistent with an economy growing near potential, hence with little change in labor market slack. than the Greenbook.  This time, with its large revision, the Greenbook is slightly more pessimistic than we are.  However, the overall negative tone of the Greenbook seems a bit puzzling to me given the current conditions that we were discussing earlier.  After all, mortgage rates are not that high.  The rate of house-price appreciation has not come down more than we expected.  Still, current conditions are softening.  A contact from a major national builder, Pulte Homes, told us that their new orders had dropped sharply and that the current high level of construction is being supported by working off backlogs.  Accordingly, he expected a more marked slowdown in building in 2007. In the business sector, the reports from the manufacturers outside autos were, in general, very upbeat.  Most indicated that orders and backlogs for investment goods were quite high.  One of my directors, who is from a large, diversified manufacturing firm and who has always been cautious about future capital spending, said that demand for long-lead-time capital goods now is as strong as he has seen in his thirty years in business.  And the pickup in nonresidential construction is partially offsetting the weaker activity on the residential side. Finally, financial conditions continue to be favorable.  Indeed, given the recent increases in inflation, real short-term interest rates are in the middle of the neutral range, as shown in the Bluebook.  Long-term borrowing costs are relatively low, and we still hear that there’s a lot of liquidity flowing through the financial system.  So we think the outlook for business investment looks solid and somewhat stronger over the course of ’06 than the Greenbook forecast. To summarize our outlook for real activity, we think that the economy has somewhat stronger underlying momentum than the Greenbook does, and we are looking for growth at a pace of around 3 percent in the second half of this year. costs.  We heard numerous reports this round of manufacturers that were passing on material cost increases to their customers.  In the Chicago Purchasing Managers Survey, which will be released this Friday, the prices-paid component shot up from 76.9 in May to 89.0 in June, and the overall index moved down from 61.5 to 56.5. Capacity constraints also appear to be more common.  For example, given industry consolidation, airline load factors are very high, and one major carrier indicated that it had been able to increase prices more than enough to cover higher fuel costs.  We also received some reports that shortages of skilled labor were holding back production.  Still, there were few signs of accelerating wage pressures. Of course, the incoming data on consumer prices have been disappointing, as Jeff Lacker just said, and as a result our indicator model’s forecasts of core PCE inflation in ’06 were revised up about 0.3 percentage point, to between 2.4 and 2.6 percent.  The higher projection is from the model estimated using data since 1967; the lower number is from the estimates using data only since 1984.  We think inflation this year will come in closer to the 2.4 percent figure as some of the cost pass-through that has already boosted prices runs its course. Looking to ’07, the model’s projections rose a tenth or two from the previous forecasts.  The prediction using the post-1984 sample is 2.1 percent, whereas the long sample projection is 2.6 percent.  So in the absence of some good news on the energy or materials costs front, I do not think that inflation will be headed into the bottom half of that range unless growth next year comes in a good deal below potential.  At 3 percent, my forecast for GDP growth in ’07 is a bit below potential.  My forecast for PCE inflation is 2.3 percent.  This outlook is conditioned on my view of appropriate policy, which is a slightly higher path for the funds rate than currently built into the should attempt to arrest this acceleration. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any comments on GM’s brutal outlook?  [Laughter] MR. MOSKOW.  Well, it’s brutal compared with last year at this time because they had an employee-incentive pricing program last year, which they’re not going to have this year.  It’s an interesting situation because they say that Chrysler has announced that they’re going to have some higher incentives.  I spoke to the CEO of General Motors.  He claims that they’re trying to hold the line on these incentives and keep them below the very high level they’ve had these past few years; they are not going to cut prices as they have in previous years.  We’ll see whether they’re able to do this, but that’s their stated position now CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I continue to think the outlook for the national economy is reasonably positive.  As best I can judge, housing activity is slowing largely as expected.  The pace of increases of home prices is decelerating.  Prices may be declining in some activity and of price behavior, what we are currently observing would have fallen within those intervals.  Other components of aggregate demand look reasonably well maintained to me.  In this regard, comments from our directors and from others with whom I have talked indicate that, except for the agricultural sector, persistently high energy prices are having at most a modest negative effect on business activity.  Moreover, and equally important in my mind, the respective paths of productivity and of aggregate hours suggest to me that the economy should continue to expand at a respectable pace going forward.  To sum up, my forecast of real activity is for slightly more growth Greenbook forecast for 2007. In this regard, I have tended at these meetings to emphasize the underlying resilience and flexibility of the economy.  I still have a lot of confidence in those characteristics, and I think they I am too sanguine about this.  Is there more to the second-quarter slowing in growth or to persistently high energy prices or to the housing situation—is there more to be concerned about than my previous statements might suggest? My tentative answer to that question is that I think we should not be overly concerned at the moment about the economic outlook in terms of growth for several reasons.  As I already suggested, the effects of persistently high energy prices, although not trivial, do not appear to be devastating either.  Furthermore, the financial system remains sound and flexible.  Interest rates for the most part are still relatively favorable, and those factors should help to sustain demand both from households and from business.  I think it is worth recalling that situation at this point; certainly bankers report, at least typically, fierce competition for customers in the current environment.  Finally, the low levels of initial claims for unemployment insurance as well as anecdotes, from our District at least, suggest continued expansion in employment. On the price front, however, current circumstances and the outlook do not now appear to me to be favorable.  Earlier I had thought that the acceleration in core inflation that we were observing was likely to be similar to the experience in early 2004, when we had an acceleration but it was relatively quickly reversed.  But a quick reversal doesn’t look all that likely to me at the moment for several reasons.  First of all, as people have already commented, the recent surprises have been on the upside, and in light of that, I have to conclude that there is a bit more underlying momentum to and responding to the same thing.  If this assessment is correct and there is more inflationary momentum, then the bulk of the analytical work that has been done seems to suggest rather strongly that arresting that momentum or reversing it is not going to be easy in the short run. Inflationary expectations apparently have not deteriorated recently, and here I am referring to the past couple of years, but I am not sure I would make the same statement with regard to the path of inflationary expectations relative to the earlier years of this decade.  Overall, I have the impression that, on the margin, a little more inflation is both characterizing the economy and being accepted by households and by businesses. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.  MR. FISHER.  Well, Mr. Chairman, last time I described the economy from our perspective as a BMW Z4 roadster that just couldn’t keep itself from exceeding the speed limit.  Based on the series of calls we made in preparation for this meeting and the Beige Book and what we are seeing in our own District, I would say that the real economy has downshifted—but as President Moskow said and as I understood President Lacker and certainly President Stern to have said—not to the degree that is projected in the Greenbook.  I would also say that, just to kill the analogy, the inflation pressure gauge needle is moving upward.  I do talk to the CEOs of two of the largest homebuilding companies, and the way I would describe their perspective is that they have migrated from amnesia to déjà vu.  Clearly, the kinds of numbers that you are projecting seem to be confirmed in terms of the default rates still running above 40 percent.  Yet some markets within the country have great strength—Texas, the Carolinas, the Pacific Northwest—which is offsetting the weakness in the Northeast, the desert area, California, and so on. nonhousing sectors.  I would summarize their views by quoting the CEO of Cadbury Schweppes.  He said that he has heard a great deal about stagflation: “The ‘stag’ is definitely not there; the ‘flation’ is increasing.”  The CEO of EDS, who has as his clients GM and Delphi, said, “You hear a lot about quarter-to-quarter slowdown.  I’m not seeing it in the general economy.” My shipping contacts report that the rate for Panamax ships, which I talked about earlier because Panamax is the most liquid of the bulk carriers and perhaps the best indicator, rose from $16,500 at the last meeting to $22,000 last week.  All the shippers to whom I spoke are revising upward the volume that they expect to ship as well as the revenue they expect to generate. The rails report that they expect the rise in second-quarter GDP to be around 4 percent in terms of their activity level, up from the first quarter.  One indicator is that Burlington Northern Santa Fe reports having shipped 200,000 units a week only one time in 2004, nine times in 2005, and sixteen times this year to date, with an acceleration in April, May, and June. I think all of us saw FedEx’s numbers that were reported.  I spoke at length with the CFO of UPS, who reports that sales were up 6 percent in the first quarter.  As of last week they are forecasting closer to 5 percent for the second quarter.  The CFO said that “there is no dramatic slowdown that we can observe.”  The chairman of an airline that moves 80 million passengers, who last time worried aloud about a slowdown that they were seeing in California, says that in terms of realistic bookings, across the nation it is strong without exception and confirms President Moskow’s point about being able to have some pricing power.  Yet because of capacity constraints in the industry as a whole, this firm is still seeing strong demand and strong growth potential. The retailers, I would say, are divided into two groups.  The higher price points continue to do well.  To quote the CEO of JCPenney: “What I am seeing through my business is not what I am price points—and I have two extremes here, 7-Eleven and Wal-Mart, in terms of their average sale and size—are clearly coming under pressure due to gasoline prices.  But one thing that I heard in talking with the CEO of the world largest retailer was that “there is a lot of pricing pressure”; and for the first time I heard the following: “We have pricing power, and we are passing it through.”   You see this statement confirmed in terms of the anecdotal evidence we’re receiving from those that supply retailers, companies like Cadbury Schweppes, Frito-Lay, and Kimberly-Clark.  The CEO of Kimberly-Clark reports that, again, demand is good on the demand side, but the cost front continues to worry them.  Regarding electronics, Texas Instruments is expecting a better second quarter than a first quarter.  In cell phones, the most significant price increases they have been able to pass through in several years are now being put into the marketplace. One ray of sunshine on the price front is in the health care sector.  According to Hewitt’s new reports—as you know, Mr. Chairman, this is the time of year in which they are negotiating the settlements for the price of health care to companies for next year—there has been a constant wrenching or ratcheting down of the increase in those prices, from 11.3 percent in ’05 to 8.2 percent in ’06, and they expect to go another percentage point downward this year. In summary, we, like the previous reporters, have a little dissonance with the Greenbook in terms of growth.  We don’t see as sharp a correction in the second quarter and looking forward.   We are, however, concerned about inflation.  As you know, we look at the trimmed mean PCE deflator in Dallas—it has been running at a rate of about 2.4 percent.  But no matter how you measure it, inflation is running above 2 percent.  We’ve asked ourselves, and done some analysis, about where the inflation pressure is coming from.  The fraction of prices weighted by expenditure increasing at annual rates of zero to 3 percent has been squeezed, whereas the fraction of prices our analysis, Mr. Chairman, the fraction of price increases above 3 percent has risen from 33 percent to 57 percent.  The fraction with price increases above 2 percent has risen from 47 to 68 percent, and small price increases have become the exception. When you ask where the pressures are coming from—it’s a little like Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express.  They all did it.  All of these prices seem to be moving, and we do seem to be seeing, for the first time, a confirmation from our private-sector contacts that price expectations are rolling into pricing behavior. One last comment.  I spoke earlier and others have spoken about liquidity in the will entail 12 million manhours.  They raised $11 billion for the project.  The money is now in the bank, nonrecourse financing at 225 basis points over Libor.  Also, you may have seen that Anadarko is effecting a merger or, rather, an acquisition of two separate companies.  The CEO of Anadarko is on our Board.  He reported that they raised $22 billion “at breathtaking speed.”  Indeed, in both transactions, three houses chose to do the entire transaction in-house.  That is my report, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, who were the respondents in that survey you were quoting about price changes? MR. FISHER.  For health care? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  You were talking about what share of price changes were above 3 percent. give you the report.  These are the breakdowns of all the different expenditure components within the PCE. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I see.   MR. FISHER.  I’d be happy to provide that analysis. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Much like the Greenbook, the reports that I hear from my directors and business contacts are consistent with an economy that is expanding, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.  Activity related to residential real estate has softened, and I continue to hear from my business contacts that they are concerned that consumer spending will retrench in response to the softer housing market and higher energy prices.  But I do not get much indication that this concern is having a substantial effect on their business plans.  Capital spending plans in particular seem little changed from the beginning of this year. As for inflation, rising costs are widely reported by my business contacts, but most of these pressures are still related to energy and material prices.  I continue to hear that productivity-adjusted wage pressures remain in check.  Among producers of intermediate goods, the number of firms that report the ability to pass through costs seems to be increasing, but as of now, I am not hearing a lot in the way of substantial price increases at the retail level. Despite what I am hearing from my business contacts, the data tell a different story, and they have affected my thinking since our last meeting.  The core inflation numbers have been drifting up, whether calculated by excluding food and energy or by the trimmed mean and median CPI measures that we monitor in Cleveland.  Since December the majority of items in the CPI weighted by their expenditure shares have risen at annual rates in excess of 3 percent.  It is still possible, of but transitory pass-through of energy and commodity prices or the realignment of rents to the exceptional residential housing market that we have seen in the past few years.  But this explanation is becoming increasingly difficult for me to defend.   At our May meeting I expressed concerns that risks were weighted against both our objectives, and the Greenbook baseline now reflects those concerns:  weaker economic growth and higher inflation.  At this time, I do not see any signs that the real economy is going to be weaker than projected in the Greenbook baseline, but unfortunately I do not expect an inflation outlook that is much better than the Greenbook baseline either.  That is my report, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My view of the outlook has not changed significantly since the last meeting.  Generally speaking, I agree that, while we will have continued growth in GDP, we also will experience the beginning of a decline and below-trend growth probably through some of the remainder of this year and into 2007. Indeed, in my view, there are increasing signs that the combination of tighter monetary policy and higher energy costs is beginning to slow the economy’s momentum.  There are clear signals that housing has begun to weaken.  Moreover, the behavior of asset prices and risk premiums in financial markets suggests that credit costs have risen and market liquidity is at least beginning to see some pressure.  Also, it is worth noting that many other central banks are moving to a more-restrictive policy stance, suggesting that slower growth is the likely outcome for other countries as well as ours over the period ahead. As we discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, I believe we must understand how our policy actions might affect the economy.  Oftentimes we do focus on the long end of the side.  Longer-term rates continue to be unusually low.  Short-term rates have risen in lockstep with the fed funds rate.  Consequently, many consumers and many small businesses that have loans tied to prime have seen sharply higher rates over the past couple of years.  In response, consumers have scaled back their use of home equity loans fairly significantly over the past few months.  In addition, the repricing of low-rate adjustable loans continues to affect household discretionary spending, and it will begin to show up in pressure on small businesses. Evidence from the Tenth District is generally consistent with the national economic trends.  Through May, District business activity continued to be strong, as others have said, especially in manufacturing and in energy, of course, for us.  Labor markets in much of our District remain tight.  However, while businesses are experiencing strong cost pressures for materials and wages, they have, as far as we can see in some of our responses, been unable to really push higher prices as much as they would like.  As a result, some profit margins are under pressure, and our most recent manufacturing survey indicates that many firms have scaled back some of their capital spending plans from earlier projections.  As in the national economy, the District’s housing activity has begun to slow.  Housing permits have dropped sharply over the past several months, and the inventory of unsold homes has risen notably in many of the metro areas of our region. Turning to the inflation outlook, I find the recent pickup in core measures of inflation to be troubling.  However, I continue to think that much of the recent increase reflects long-past actions in monetary policy and some of the other resulting combinations of pass-through energy costs and the weaker dollar.  Consequently, although we are likely to see more months of elevated inflation readings, I believe that inflation will likely decline over the forecast period, assuming that we are would expect core PCE inflation to decline from about 2.4 this year to 2.1 next year. The topic of inflation expectations has received considerable attention, but I see little evidence that expectations have changed significantly, at least so far.  Long-run survey measures of expected inflation remain anchored around 2½ percent for CPI.  Moreover, although the TIPS data suggest that inflation risk premiums are somewhat higher than they were earlier this year, these premiums do remain low by historical standards.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While recent data show that Sixth District economic activity was solid in the early spring, anecdotal reports for May and June point to some definite deceleration.  The deceleration is particularly evident in housing, where an orderly slowing is now noted for the first time in areas outside Florida.  Reports from Florida, especially from the hotter markets, of significantly weak single family and multifamily sales have also continued during the intermeeting period.  It is especially noteworthy that both residential and nonresidential construction in hurricane-prone areas is now being severely affected by insurance problems.  Underwriters are increasingly unwilling to write insurance, and those who will write it are asking for gigantic increases in premiums. Housing prices are not falling quite as much as the decline in sales and the rise in unsold inventories might suggest.  We are getting reports that builders are now making concessions and providing upgrades, such as marble countertops and other extras, and in one case even throwing in a free Mini Cooper to sweeten the deal [laughter] rather than reducing prices.  So real house prices double, and in some areas we have heard reports of increases substantially larger than that.   Some slowing is also evidenced in other areas besides housing.  Consumption appears to be less strong than it was in the early spring, with most of the recent deceleration in consumer spending appearing to be focused on lower-end retailers.  The most frequently heard explanation is the higher price of gasoline.  Manufacturing remains mixed, and for the first time in years, some building-supply producers outside hurricane areas are expecting business to slow in coming months. Price increases continue to be noted at the producer level, especially for construction materials, petroleum products, metals, and fuels—even with the decline in natural gas prices.  Firms are raising their final prices as much as they can, given the competitive environment, and fuel surcharges remain in place; but in short, this is more of the same on the price front. Redevelopment from last fall’s major hurricanes along our Gulf Coast region and in New Orleans continues to have important consequences for our region’s economy.  In the Lake Charles area of Louisiana, which is the westernmost part of the state, recovery is showing the usual patterns that we’ve seen after other hurricanes over the years.  Growth is now slightly above that of last year.  Employment led by construction is up about 2 percent over levels a year ago.  Parts of the Mississippi coast are on a similar track.  The big shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, which suffered more than $1 billion in damages, is back in production and is now employing about 12,000 people, compared with 13,000 before the storm.  Other parts of the Mississippi coast are recovering more slowly because of a shortage of housing and the slowness in getting casinos back on line.  Employment gains are dependent on the gaming industry, but it looks as though it will be late this year before most of the casinos will be able to reopen. significant rebuilding has not yet begun, and most people who left have not yet returned.  The area did add 24,000 jobs from the low point, but this number pales in comparison with the 191,000 jobs that were lost between April 2005 and April 2006.  The area will continue to languish until the political and regulatory issues surrounding rebuilding are resolved and federal money begins to flow in significant amounts next year. Finally, with respect to energy, repair to the damaged Gulf Coast region drilling platforms, pipeline, and refineries has progressed, and the shut-in rates in May are now down to 20 percent for oil and about 10 percent for natural gas.  With the big Mars platform back fully on line, these shut-in figures should soon show additional improvement. Turning to the national economy, GDP growth has clearly slowed, but it is also beginning to exhibit increased volatility from quarter to quarter that is more characteristic of what we saw in the 1990s rather than the uncharacteristically steady quarter-to-quarter pattern of the past several years.  The volatility makes extracting signals about the likely growth path from recent data more difficult, as reflected in the wide error bands around the near-term growth projections provided in the Greenbook.  My own forecast for growth in employment submitted for this meeting is slightly more optimistic than that in the Greenbook but is well within the forecast error bands. Of greater concern to me, however, is the inflation outlook.  Three issues related to inflation are particularly troublesome.  First, core inflation has been outside the range that many of us have publicly stated we would prefer, and some of us have been expressing increased concern about the more recent data.  Some of the work my staff has done in attempting to decompose signal from noise in these numbers implies that much of the recent rise in the three-month and six-month CPI that has gotten so much attention is noise.  But this implication in no way blunts the fact that even little sign of abating. Second, many have noted that the most recent jump in core CPI was driven by an increase in owners’ equivalent rent.  Again, work my staff has done decomposing the core CPI, looking back at the period of very low inflation as well as at the more recent period, clearly implies that the recent increase in owners’ equivalent rent should not have been a surprise because the number is driven by the fundamentals of demand for homeownership relative to rental demand.  With interest rates so low during the immediate post-recession period, we estimated that the preference shift for new homes relative to rental units accounted for almost half of the 1.6 percent decline that occurred in core CPI during the November 2001 to December 2003 period.  Since then, with a rise in our policy interest rate, housing demand has slowed, and demand for rental units has increased with commensurate increases in rents.  The point is that this movement in core CPI prices has a lot to do with our own policy shift.  Putting the proper measurement debate aside, this raises the difficult question of under what circumstances we should respond to cyclical price movements that are themselves temporary responses to previous policy rate increases. My third and last concern relates to our ability, or perhaps our willingness, in the near term or the medium term to engineer core inflation, however measured, down to the 1 percent to 2 percent range, and the risk that our continued adherence to that much-talked-about, very specific, and very tight objective without more explanation of how we plan to take such a range into account in our policy setting may soon paint us into a difficult policy corner.  But I’ll leave further thoughts on that to the policy discussion tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Stone. moderating in the second quarter.  Our pattern is similar to that of the nation, but the District had less acceleration in the first quarter and less deceleration in the second quarter.   Payroll employment growth in our three states is slowing.  The unemployment rate has edged up slightly over the past several months, but the unemployment rate in most of the District’s labor markets is still lower than a year ago.  Our business contacts still report some difficulty in filling open positions, and a quarter of the respondents to a special question in our Business Outlook Survey of Manufacturers say that the increases in wage rates needed to attract new hires this year are higher than they were last year.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but the indexes for new orders and shipments were up noticeably after a one-month slump in May.  Despite this improvement, our manufacturers’ expectations about future activity have deteriorated.  While they still plan to add to payrolls and expand capacity over the next six months, they have moderated these plans since the beginning of the year. At the last meeting, I reported that, in contrast to other Districts, retailers in our region did not express much concern that higher gasoline prices would eat into their sales; that view has changed.  Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what I reported at our last meeting.  Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen, but the acceleration doesn’t appear to be as strong as elsewhere in the nation.  In contrast, residential construction in our three states has been flat this year, and home sales are down.  Thus far the slowing in our region looks to be an orderly process. Unfortunately, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region appear to be increasing at a faster pace than those in the nation as a whole, primarily because of a larger increase in housing costs in industrial price pressures have increased in recent months.  Fortunately, we do not see a similar acceleration in labor costs, although the increases we are seeing in the Northeast are somewhat higher than in other parts in the country. In summary, current conditions and the outlook in our region continue to be positive, but the rate of expansion is expected to be somewhat more modest than we’ve seen over the past year.  Price pressures continue to be a concern in our region. Turning to the national front, I would characterize the outlook in a similar way.  Our growth forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s for 2006.  We expect a significant slowing in activity in the second quarter followed by a pickup during the second half of the year to a pace that is slightly below potential.  The slowdown in housing and high gasoline prices contribute to a slowdown in consumer spending, and the lagged effects of rising short-term interest rates and higher oil prices keep real growth slightly below potential. Our forecast for 2007 differs somewhat from the Greenbook.  We see growth in 2007 slightly below that in 2006, whereas the Greenbook sees growth slowing appreciably.  In our view, there has been more underlying strength in the economy.  For example, we attribute more of the second-quarter slowdown to temporary factors.  We are more optimistic than the Greenbook about employment growth.  We see nonfarm payroll growth averaging a good deal more than the Greenbook forecast.  We see unemployment rising to 5.1 percent by the fourth quarter of next year. Our inflation outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook’s partly because we see less slowing of aggregate demand.  We do not see core PCE inflation decelerating next year.  We think the economy has been operating and will continue to operate slightly beyond full employment over the next several quarters and that foreign price competition will ease as the dollar depreciates.  So expect core inflation not to decelerate.  We do see some deceleration in 2008, but that is because we built in a slightly higher path for interest rates than that in the Greenbook forecast.  Of course, there are risks to the forecast.  Most of them have been mentioned; but in our view, the risks to growth, even at our higher level of growth, are roughly balanced.  In contrast, the inflation risks are slightly to the upside.  As people have noted, core inflation has accelerated in recent months, and it is above the range I consider consistent with price stability.  Should aggregate demand moderate less than expected, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge.  At this point, I believe that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored, and our forecast is predicated on monetary policy ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise longer-term expectations. This is likely my last meeting, but for sure I’ll be watching carefully as we go forward.  I have confidence that the Committee, along with the new Philadelphia president, will do a good job to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored.  I’d like to thank the Chairman, the participants, and the rest of this staff for how well you have treated me over the past three meetings.  I have to remember that I made the statement in June 2000 that it would be my last meeting, so I say “in the foreseeable future” [laughter] it will be my last meeting.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Let’s go to President Yellen, and then perhaps we can take a break. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff presentations make abundantly clear that most of the data we have received since we met in May have been disappointing in one way or another.  Recent economic activity appears to have been quite a bit weaker than expected, as exemplified by the Greenbook, which shows a significant downward revision to 2 percent growth in year.  However, in view of the possibility that labor and product markets may have moved a bit beyond full utilization, as well as the recent high readings on core inflation, a period of growth a bit below potential could be seen as necessary to prevent a buildup of underlying inflationary pressures. Under the assumption of one more funds rate increase at this meeting, it seems reasonable to me that growth will remain somewhat below its potential rate, that the unemployment rate will gradually trend upward to slightly above the NAIRU by the end of next year, and that core inflation will gradually move down toward my comfort zone.  If things work out that way, I suppose the outcome would be nearly optimal, given that we are starting from an undesirably high inflation figure in the second quarter. My concern is that it is very difficult at this stage to rule out a much less desirable scenario in which the lagged effects of our earlier reactions restrain activity more strongly and more persistently than we now expect.  We might also see further financial disruptions as a consequence of investors’ increased risk aversion, which is the bearish possibility that Dino described earlier.  In other words, the question is whether the large surprise in the second quarter will be followed by a series of similar surprises later this year.  I am concerned about downside risks to the real outlook, especially until we can better gauge the magnitude of the repercussions from the weakening in housing markets that now clearly is under way. The data on core inflation in recent months present the opposite concern, having been higher than expected and pushing core inflation slightly above my comfort zone over the past year.  This raises the possibility that we are making systematic errors in our understanding of the fundamental forces driving inflation.  The key question is whether the necessary decline in inflation requires more action from us or whether inflation is being pushed up by temporary factors that will dissipate next year and a half as the effects of several temporary factors abate.  One possibility in this regard is that there has been a modest pass-through from energy-price increases to core inflation and that these effects will dissipate if energy prices stabilize at today’s elevated levels.  Moreover, part of the recent uptick traces to large increases in housing costs that are finally showing up in the CPI just as the housing market is slowing.  As David noted in his briefing, the CPI measure of changes in housing prices for owner-occupied housing reflects movements in market rental rates rather than house prices and interest rates. After long being stagnant or even falling, rents are finally moving up.  Perhaps with higher mortgage interest rates and lower expectations of house-price appreciation, speculative properties are being dumped into the market, and families in the market for housing are now more inclined to rent rather than buy, driving rents up and housing prices down.  It certainly would not be surprising to see a return to a more normal relationship between rents and house prices.  Such a phenomenon, if it is now playing out, would most likely be transitory rather than permanent, although it could play out for quite some time. Unfortunately, at this point it is difficult to tell how much of the recent rise in core inflation is temporary and how much is due to underlying inflation pressures like tight labor and product were it not for the largely reassuring data on productivity, labor compensation, and profit margins.  That said, the good news is all in the forecast, whereas the bad news is in the data.  So I certainly can’t rule out the possibility that the increase in core inflation in the second quarter is the leading edge of a developing trend. had some rather large surprises in both output and inflation since we last met.  It seems to me that, in the policy round coming up, the more important matters are the risks that growth could slow much more than now seems likely or that inflation could prove to be a more serious problem than I currently expect it to be or, for that matter, that both factors could come into play.  It is unlikely that we will be able to sharpen our assessment of these risks very much until more time passes and more data become available. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Why don’t we take a coffee break and be back at five after?  Thank you very much. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  New England’s economy remains in relatively good shape, though not particularly vibrant or reflective of great strength going forward.  Employment growth has been positive but slow in comparison to the nation.  New England usually has a lower unemployment rate than the nation does, but for the first time in a decade or so the region’s unemployment rate has converged, mostly because the national rate dropped, but the region has flattened out over the past several months.  Local measures of year-over-year inflation are about on track with the nation as well, though growth of local fuel and utility costs is considerably higher.  Many business people talk about their efforts to limit their energy costs by upgrading capital equipment and facilities to be more energy efficient and by looking into alternative sources of energy.  They also report mild success in passing along increased costs to consumers.  Perhaps reflecting this, the rising price of confidence has sagged a good deal.     But not all the news is gloomy.  Business sentiment, as suggested by surveys and our meetings with our Small Business Advisory Group, remains positive overall as businesses report solid growth and positive hiring plans.  Many continue to note how hard it is to find the skilled labor they need.  Class A office vacancies have declined in both downtown and suburban taxes, are exceeding budgets in every state except Rhode Island, which appears to be experiencing an extended, though as yet unexplained, soft spot.  In general, I sense a good deal of optimism among my business contacts about their own firms but uncertainty as well when they look at the evolution of both the regional and the national economies.  Indeed, both the coincident regional index done by the Philadelphia Fed and the leading index for Massachusetts that’s done by the University of Massachusetts indicate that the regional economy is likely to grow only at a modest pace over the next year or so, buoyed by a resurgence in worldwide demand for high-tech and biotech products but weighed down by subdued consumer spending in the midst of high energy costs and declines in local housing  I just want to reflect a bit on regional residential real estate markets.  Here various data sources—and there are lots of them—suggest that regional markets have slowed, with sales falling in April and to a lesser degree in May, and unsold inventories continuing to rise, with the number of months’ supply growing from about 8.7 in May of last year to more than 11 in May of this year.  However, prices, depending on whether you look at median sales or repeat sales, either have fallen only slightly or have risen at about half the pace they had been rising.  Most analysts appreciation.  Thus, while the local media and many pundits, national as well as local, wring their hands over the potential for major real estate problems, at least up to now the market correction in New England appears to be proceeding in a fairly benign way.  Turning to the national scene, incoming data have served to reinforce a sense of risk on both sides of the Greenbook forecast.  As I noted earlier, that forecast is not markedly different from our own, so when I talk about risk it will be the risk to our own forecast as well.  To some degree, both slower growth and higher inflation were expected in the forecasts that we’ve made over the past six months or so, but recent data may be exceeding those expectations.  On the growth side, residential construction has slowed a bit more rapidly than we thought.  Consumer confidence has fallen off.  Weaker equity markets, higher gas prices, and somewhat lower housing prices have likely affected consumer spending, and recent data on job growth have been slower.   But there continue to be a good number of supports to growth.  Household wealth remains high.  Growth abroad remains solid.  Financial conditions outside equity markets are accommodative.  Businesses remain highly profitable and cash rich as reflected in the mini-boom in investment in nonresidential structures, and productivity growth remains strong.  Indeed, if one averages Q1 and Q2 expected growth, it’s a bit above our earlier forecast, though clearly one needs to be mindful of the fact that the first half started with a bang and its recent momentum has been considerably cooler.   Does this recent cooling portend a faster and steeper slowdown for the rest of ’06 than reflected in the current Greenbook forecast or our own?  Or could there be enough underlying strength to take us back to the growth scenario of our earlier projections?  In particular, I wonder don’t know what the possibility is of some surprise on the upside to the Greenbook’s current ’06 and, particularly, ’07 projections, but I think there may well be some.  The incoming data have been more disquieting on the price front.  I’m not a person who believes that a given level of inflation is bad in and of itself, within reason of course.  I think it’s important to assess the level of inflation against everything else going on in the economy.  So at times a level of 2 percent and change might be fine; at other times it might bear watching.  And as far as I know, it’s been hard to prove that specific low levels of inflation—let’s say, below 3 percent—are bad in and of themselves.  But I do believe that a rapid increase or decrease in the rate of inflation growth can portend debilitating change in the economy.  Such increases or have viewed the six- and three-month changes in core CPI and PCE with some alarm as the rate of change has been faster than I am comfortable with and certainly faster than our forecast expected.  Looking at the first half of this year, and using the Greenbook forecast for Q2, we see that core inflation is nearly 50 basis points higher than what we, in Boston at least, had expected.  Our analysis suggests that most of the reason for this surge in inflation over the past couple of years has been higher energy costs.  Barring untoward geopolitical events, that should mean that inflation growth will moderate.  But given the small to nonexistent output gap we see currently reflected in the low unemployment rate, there is more than a minor risk that resource pressures could begin to play a role in inflationary growth.  The Greenbook forecast suggests that slower growth will provide a moderating influence on inflation.  That’s our best bet as well, but prudent risk management might suggest some hedging of that bet.  Thank you.   MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me outline a few comments from my business contacts first.  Wal-Mart—and Richard talked about that a bit—has a substantial piece of its business, but by no means all of it, with lower-income consumers.  They are coming in several hundred basis points below plan since Easter, and that’s for the entire business.  That’s a pretty substantial hit for the world’s largest retailer—of course, that’s mostly U.S. business.  There is a pronounced paycheck cycle.  An example that my contact gave me was that right after receiving paychecks, which generally come at the end of the month and the middle of the month, consumers are buying large economy-size packages of stuff that comes that way.  As they go through the month, up to the next paycheck, they are buying increasingly smaller quantities.  They’re just running out of liquidity until the next paycheck comes.  Wal-Mart still has many applicants for every job.  On average, when they are expanding, they have ten applicants for every job.   My contact at J.B. Hunt said that he had the general perception that the economy is slowing.  Hunt and, I think, many other truck companies have not been expanding their fleets.  In fact, Hunt has cut back its truck fleet because of the shortage of drivers.  My contact said that there’s a dire—that was his word—shortage of drivers; the shortage is worse than he has ever seen it.  But—and I think this is interesting—Hunt is not responding with wage increases beyond the normal 3 to 4 percent a year.  I talked to my contact about that, and he said they are just not ready to raise wages.  What they do is to manage their business by telling people that “the truck capacity is not available; go someplace else.”  Some of that is trying to push customers into higher-cost deliveries at Hunt, and the customers may go that way or may just go someplace else. The Greenbook discussed the large truck issue with the new truck engine requirements.  That’s going to produce a very large cycle in large trucks.  I guess that the companies producing those large trucks and engines are fully occupied this year, and then there’s going to be a slack period.   My FedEx contact said that he does not see weakness in any part of the business except domestic express.  What’s happening there is that, because of the high fuel surcharges and the improved ground service, quite a number of customers are shifting from express air, which is much more expensive, to ground.  He said that they do have some pressure regarding IT and accounting professionals.  Salaries in those areas are rising perhaps 15 percent above last year.   My UPS contact talked mostly about a tentative agreement with its pilots union.  (This is not yet public information; I think it will be released later this week.)  The characteristics of the agreement are quite interesting.  I may not have all the details quite correct, but one of the things that astonished me is that the agreement, if ratified by the membership, runs to 12/31/2011—a labor contract that extends to 2011!   There’s an upfront 17.7 percent pay increase, but it reflects the fact that there have been no increases since the previous contact expired in 2003, so there’s a makeup there.  But the percentage increases thereafter to me are quite low, and it’s interesting that they were able to get the pilots to sign on.  After eighteen months, 3 percent, and then every twelve months thereafter, 3.25, 3.25, 3.25, 3.50—that may not all add up to 2011, but I was writing as fast as I could—but that’s the general pattern, 3.25 to 3.5 percent stretched out over coming years.  They bargained hard, and UPS was able to have a contract with no cost-of-living adjustment in it, which I think is significant in terms of inflation expectations.  There were some other allowances having to do with work rules, some per diem allowances, pensions, and so forth.  So the total costs are a bit higher than the 3.25, 3.5 percent would indicate, but that is the $60,000 for signing on the dotted line that ratifies the contract, a first officer will get $40,000, and a second officer will get $34,000.  Those bonuses, I believe, will not show up in the ECI, given the way the ECI is put together.  So I think we want to keep our eyes out for wage agreements that have things in them that escape the ECI.  I expect FedEx to follow pretty quickly.   Now I want to make a couple of general comments.  The Greenbook certainly has a pretty strong business capital spending projection.  My view is that, in recent years, companies have had rather contained or constrained capital expenditures, and firms worked hard to be disciplined in cost control to make sure they didn’t expand capacity until they really needed it.  Of course, corporate profits have done very well.  But now many companies have very little excess capacity, and they are putting in place more capacity.  My FedEx contact said that FedEx is increasing its capital expenditures this year, and 75 percent of the spending is for capacity expansion.  In recent years, a much larger fraction was for productivity improvement rather than capacity expansion.  So I think that this expansion of capacity reflects business optimism about the long run.  Most of these plans have a very long period connected with them.  Even though some of the expansion involves items, like computers, that are purchased off the shelf, these items are part of a much longer term plan.  I don’t think this part of the economy is vulnerable to a quick turnaround.  The slower growth in consumption likely reflects the pressures on lower-income consumers, and we have limited spending capacity, perhaps for many consumers, because the saving rate is already so low.  So maybe what we’re seeing is the long-awaited and long-desired shift in the composition of GDP toward more business investment and less consumption, and that higher net exports, but this would be a change in composition with less consumption, less housing, and more business investment.  There’s been a lot of discussion about energy pass-through.  I’m going to make an assertion that’s probably a little too bold, but I think it’s basically correct:  If energy prices stay where they are, in the long run full pass-through must occur.  Companies can’t absorb energy costs forever.  Full pass-through must occur, and the pass-through occurs in several ways.  One way, as with the UPS and FedEx surcharges, is that they just put those into the business.  They just are not going to absorb those.  Other types of pass-through occur through companies’ substituting energy-saving technology—for example, to reduce energy intensity—but such technologies don’t come free.  So they’re going to have to include the costs of those substitutions in what they do.  Then we can have changes in the mix of goods that are produced and consumed, such as the change in the mix away from express air toward ground service.  But the energy pass-through has to be complete in the long run.  If we’re going to avoid a long-run effect on the price level, higher energy prices must be offset by lower prices elsewhere, so that this becomes a change in relative prices without an effect on the aggregate price level.  I just wanted to make that comment because it looks to me as though we’re in a situation in which oil is expected to remain around $70 a barrel for an indefinite future and those adjustments are going to be taking place continuously.  So we ought to work under the assumption that there’s going to be complete pass-through.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.  Sorry, point of intervention.  here.  I’ve taken “pass-through” to mean an increase in the overall core rate, and I think that’s the way everyone else has used it.  So the scenario you describe wouldn’t result in any pass-through, the way for example President Yellen used the term.  Am I right?     MR. POOLE.  Part of what we’ve been doing is looking at individual cases.  Until recently, for example, the passenger airlines were unable to pass through fuel increases, whereas the UPSes and FedExes of the world were able to pass them through.  But eventually, the passenger airlines have to pass through because they’re unprofitable if they don’t.  The price increases have to pass through.   MR. LACKER.  I understand that, Bill.   MR. POOLE.  We’ve been using the term as a way of understanding some of the underlying pricing power that firms have.  Firms do absorb cost increases in the short run, but they can’t absorb them in the long run.  So what has to happen is that the secondary effects will show up in the level of core unless we put downward pressure on the non-energy-related parts, so that this ends up being a relative price change and not a change in the aggregate price level.  That’s the point I’m trying to make.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chair.   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I guess I’d say the center of gravity of this discussion is a little stronger than the Greenbook, and I think that’s pretty much where we are, too.  We expect real GDP growth to follow a path pretty close to potential in the balance of ’06 and in ’07, and we expect core PCE inflation to moderate gradually to around 2 percent in ’07.  This forecast assumes a monetary policy path close to that of the Greenbook, somewhat under the market’s forecast.  Since May, in our view, the balance of risks has shifted a more upside risk to inflation.  Relative to the Greenbook, however, this implies that we have a stronger trajectory for demand growth and a slightly lower path for inflation.   On the growth side, I guess I’d say we see a pretty healthy adjustment process under way with a change in the composition of growth.  We don’t see the incoming data, the anecdotes, and the recent developments in financial markets as supporting the view that real growth is likely to stay significantly below potential over the full forecast period.  We had already anticipated the slowdown in residential investment that has now materialized; therefore, we didn’t see that as a basis for revising down our forecast.  We believe the changes in household wealth in general have less effect on consumption than the Board staff believes, and as a result we expect a more modest deceleration in growth.  We expect stronger employment growth, too, and we have a stronger view of the rate of growth in private investment going forward.  The world economy still looks pretty robust to us.  So overall, in our view, this supports a forecast for the economy to be growing at a rate a bit above 3 percent over the next year and a half.  But the risks to this forecast of growth seem a little less balanced than they did in May.  We see less chance that the expansion is going to reaccelerate to a pace significantly above potential, and we see a bit more chance for a weaker outcome.  The principal source of downside risk to us remains the possibility that households are going to reduce consumption growth significantly because they feel less rich, less secure, less comfortable borrowing, and less certain about the future.   On the inflation outlook, we have moved up our expected trajectory for core PCE price inflation, but we still expect this measure to moderate, as I said, to around 2 percent by the end of ’07.  This forecast is pretty favorable.  It rests on the familiar fundamental forces of energy forward.  Strong productivity growth keeps unit labor costs from accelerating sharply.  Profit move back toward its historical average.  Growth of aggregate demand moderates to potential—it probably has already moderated to potential—which attenuates the risk of further upside pressure on resource utilization going forward.  Most important, long-term inflation expectations have come down a bit.  They remain in the range of the past few years, and they have proven responsive to changes in policy expectations in a more reassuring way than we saw very recently.   As in May, however, we believe the risks to this forecast are still somewhat to the upside because of the following:  Headline inflation and near-term inflation expectations have been running substantially above core for some time.  Virtually all the ways we try to capture underlying inflation have been running above core.  The recent rise in core may imply more momentum in inflation dynamics.  You might say that long-term inflation expectations are a little higher than we want over time, and they may have been too responsive to changes in the incoming data.  The medium-term trajectory for the dollar seems likely to be down.  Profit breakevens and TIPS.  The long-term forecasts of inflation that the staff presentations give us show a lot of persistence of inflation.  Inflation falls very, very slowly over time; and if that path is right, it could cause some further damage to inflation psychology.  If you just step back and look at how much our expectations and the markets’ expectations about the terminal rate, the funds rate at which we’d stop tightening, have changed about 200 basis points below where we are now.  That change may imply that we will learn in retrospect that we were too loose for too long, and therefore we’ll have to do more than we thought to counteract that effect on inflation.  That’s a possibility, not a prediction.  So as I said in the beginning, in some sense the balance of risks has shifted in a way that complicates the monetary policy choice for us, and the shift leaves us with less confidence about the appropriate path for policy going forward.  On balance, monetary policy appears to be getting some traction in the United States, and the expansion still looks to be in good shape.  Inflation risks seem a bit tilted to the upside, and monetary policy needs to continue to be directed at ensuring significant moderation in the trajectory of inflation over the next few years.  Thank you.    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.   MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data have tended to confirm to a degree both the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to core inflation that we’ve been talking about at recent meetings.  Higher inflation interacting with policymaker comments on the inflation situation triggered higher expected real interest rates and more uncertainty about the longer-term future.  That in turn further tightened financial conditions, leading to more confined to the United States, given strong growth abroad, high energy and commodity prices, and a sense that output is close to potential.  Widespread policy tightening and greater uncertainty have led to increased caution on the part of investors and tighter global financial conditions. The incoming data certainly have influenced my projections—I expect less growth and more inflation than I did a few months ago.  I’m also even less confident, if that’s possible, than I soon will be in place—that is, after tomorrow—to keep core inflation at considerably lower levels than it has been so far this year.  I think they are, and in this regard I’m a touch more optimistic than the staff.  I have slightly lower inflation for 2007 with the same policy assumption.   Most important, I don’t believe that the extra inflation we’ve had results from the economy producing beyond its long-run potential.  We obviously can’t be very confident about this.  The decline in the unemployment rate to noticeably below 5 percent occurred only at the beginning of this year, but the behavior of compensation last year and this year suggests to me that the NAIRU is more likely to be under than to be over 5 percent.  Perhaps better job-matching through Internet search, declining real minimum wages, and lingering worker insecurity, after the only-moderate increase in employment early in this expansion, have lowered the NAIRU a touch.  We should expect compensation growth to pick up as in the staff forecast, but the implications of this pickup for inflation are unclear, given elevated profit margins and what is likely to be a competitive business environment.  I do think relative price adjustments are playing an important role in what we’ve been seeing.  I suspect I have been implicitly underestimating the effect of higher energy prices on both output and inflation.  Before this year, the effect of rising energy prices on inflation was offset by slack in the economy, and the effect on activity was offset by easing monetary policy that was put in place to counter that slack.  With both slack and easing policy disappearing, the effects of higher energy prices are showing through in both output and inflation.    Another adverse price shock seems to be coming from the housing market, where the previous run-up in prices and the higher interest rates are weakening prospects for home price owners’ equivalent rents.  The longer-term inflation effects of both these relative price changes will depend on their persistence and their propagation into other prices.  In this regard, President Poole, I see us as perhaps accommodating the first-round effects of the increase in prices but making sure they don’t propagate beyond that, rather than having a price-level target that would bring us back down to the old price level.  With regard to persistence, petroleum prices have leveled out since April, and futures markets don’t suggest further increases.  It’s difficult to get much of a fix on future rent increases, as prices and rents realign to higher interest rates and lower expected capital gains.  In the past, most of that realignment has come through prices; but we don’t have many observations, and the required adjustment appears much larger this time.  There are two keys to preventing the relative price changes from becoming embedded in broader and more persistent inflation:  low inflation expectations and a competitive business environment.  If energy prices do flatten out, headline inflation will come down, and I think that will help to contain the inflation expectations of households and businesses and bring down core inflation.  The propagation of higher rates of increase in rents, should they persist, to other prices I found much harder to analyze.  After all, homeowners are, in effect, paying themselves higher imputed prices, and it’s not clear that they would change their behavior in labor markets to expect higher wages as a result.  Moreover, with respect to owners’ equivalent rent, I think our usual financial market measures of inflation expectations may not be reliable indicators of behavioral shifts.  Expected persistent increases in owners’ equivalent rent will boost expected CPI showing up in TIPS spreads but not necessarily affecting other pricing decisions.  A inflation rather than on simply reacting to the incoming data.    The competitive environment will depend largely on the degree of resource utilization.  In this regard, the negative effects of the oil and housing market developments on activity, along with the tightening in financial conditions, suggest that activity could well run at least a little below the rate of growth of potential for the next several quarters.  That will help to limit longer-run inflation pressures.  In a sense, the forces that seem to be pushing up inflation are also contributing to the conditions that should hold it in check.  In sum, recent inflation data have been an unpleasant surprise, but the source of the price increases—that is, price shocks, not overshooting—and the economic conditions coming into place should imply a softening of core inflation over the next 1½ years.  This outcome is based on the assumption that the relative price increases don’t become more broadly embedded in other prices and second-round effects.  We’ll talk tomorrow about how policy might contribute to reducing the odds of that possibility.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.       CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies.   MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I continue in my concern, which I expressed at the last meeting, about the recent pickup in inflation, especially given the news that we’ve had since the last meeting.  In the past three months, core CPI prices and core PCE prices have grown, respectively, at 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, twice their rate of growth in the previous three months.   It has been interesting to listen to and read the analyses that many folks are doing, trying to parse the reasons for the jump in the inflation rates, no matter what index people are following.   inflation or whether it’s one-off kinds of changes.  We’ve already had several thoughts about how to look at the relation of energy-price increases and their persistence to the rate of inflation.  I won’t add any more to what has already been said, but I thought Mr. Wilcox had a good discussion of the owners’ equivalent rent problem.  What are we really looking at here?  Some of the possibilities I found amusing.  One of them, for example, pointed out that the index used to look at the cost of bank services was up significantly because the opportunity cost on demand deposits had gone up.  If that’s the problem, we can cure it by just stopping the raising of rates.  [Laughter]  So I do think we need to really focus on where we are.  Without being able to really understand the underlying framework here, I am very concerned about the trend.   When I looked at the dramatic drop in forecast growth, at first I became very pessimistic about the outlook, as several of you have also commented.  But the more I looked at the numbers, the more I came to realize that the reduction is all coming from residential housing construction.  Everything else is basically a push from the last forecast for this year and next year.  When I look at the forecast with that perspective, I see things differently.  I’ve been concerned about the amount of speculation in housing construction throughout the country.  To the extent that what’s coming out of the housing sector is this excess speculation, that’s healthy both for the long-run economy and for the stability of the financial system.  One of our challenges in looking at some of the recent indicators is to determine whether we will really have a soft transition to more sustainable long-term growth of new housing or whether the transition will be bumpier or perhaps more abrupt.  A chart in the Greenbook that got my attention was how rapidly the cancellation of sales orders for new housing had jumped within the past five months, from its long-run trend of 22 percent since ’95 to a high rate of 30 percent.  Some of inventory, and so we may see more of a blip; that’s something I think we need to watch.  I think we can’t be complacent that a nice easing into long-term sustainable growth of housing is a sure thing at this point.   At the same time, because the drop in the forecast is all housing, the question is how to look at the relative growth of the rest of the economy.  Since on net it’s basically moving the way it was, I said to myself that I was comfortable with that.  But why am I uncomfortable going forward?  I, too, hear anecdotes about companies’ optimism about what they can do in terms of increasing revenues and profits.   Regarding the capacity issue, we need to realize that a lot of the resources in housing construction are not necessarily transferable to other sectors, except perhaps to commercial real estate.  That sector is forecast to pick up, and so some of the growth could happen there.  But the inability to transfer resources still raises issues, in terms of both fixed investments and people, and I don’t believe that the apparent slowdown to below trend, since it is driven by housing construction, is really going to create much excess capacity.  So that situation makes me concerned about inflation.  Finally, I’d like to talk about how housing affects liquidity and monetary policy and our accommodation.  Several of you and the staff said earlier that we have seen a bit of adjustment in debt spreads since the last meeting—and volatility is up—but we all agree that spreads are still very narrow by historical standards.  Focusing on the staff’s forecast of the flow of funds for the next two years, I found an interesting thing if you look at what’s happening when housing drops to the level forecasted in the Greenbook.  Households, in borrowing for mortgages, basically have been the major user of net borrowing in the past couple of years.  The forecast is for amount by which net household borrowing drops is more than the borrowing by all other sectors combined last year.  So part of the issue is that, because households are such a powerful engine in net borrowing, there will be plenty of funds available.  Also, as to the extent that bank borrowing and funds provision are forecast to drop, the bankers I talked with said that they aren’t going to let the amount of loans that they extend drop as much as I think is in that forecast.  So I really believe that the drop in housing is actually on net going to make liquidity available for other sectors rather than being a drain going forward and that will also get the growth rate more positive than the current Greenbook forecasts.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.    MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In terms of my overall comments, I consider my views really in the center of gravity, as the Vice Chairman described it, of the speakers around the table and probably, again, quite a bit more optimistic in terms of GDP growth and perhaps also more concerned about inflation risks than the Greenbook.   When I look at the strength of the fundamentals of the economy, including strong and accelerating profits, low unemployment, highly accessible capital markets, and remarkably strong balance sheets both for consumers and businesses, I find it hard to reconcile those with some of the pessimism coming not just from the Greenbook but also from some economists that the markets follow.  The two trends and the two sets of data seem to be going in very different directions.    Regarding the data that have come in since our last FOMC meeting, some time has been spent here on a few of the negative surprises, so I want to highlight a few of the positive bits of news.  Federal tax receipts in May were up 26 percent from May a year ago.  For the past twelve 12.9 percent.  Core retail sales rose 0.4 percent in May, up about 6.9 percent year over year if we exclude some of the more volatile items.  According to surveys and anecdotes, the manufacturing base continues to be remarkably robust, both in terms of growth and in terms of jobs.  I’d also note that durable goods orders, though not incredibly robust over the past month, represent growth of about 10 percent over the past three months if we exclude aircraft and look only at nondefense capital goods.  So all in all, I think that the data suggest a more positive trend.   What I’d like to do is spend a little time talking about how the markets have reacted to this news and build on a couple of the points that Dino made at the outset.  First, a lot of pundits have described the “new volatility” in the marketplace, and I think that Dino made a very compelling case that the volatility has really not been nearly as severe as the commentators suggest.  Volatility has in some ways been a euphemism for the fact that the markets have been down, and those are obviously quite different things.  [Laughter]  I think another bit of conventional wisdom is influencing decisionmakers, both in Washington and in business, and it is probably important to correct.  That idea is that somehow the Fed has been the cause of this market volatility.  I think that is largely incorrect.  When I look at what has happened, I think that the markets are focused more and more on core economic fundamentals.  We have changed in the perspective of the markets, which used to think some months and quarters ago that bad news meant good news and now they think that bad news is actually bad news.  The bad news previously meant that we weren’t going to be moving rates higher.  Again, I think the markets, not the commentators, have a better understanding that they really need to be focusing on economic fundamentals. state of corporate profit growth at this point in the cycle.  Over the past twelve months, it was 13.6 percent, and if we look at bottom-up analyst forward estimates for the S&P 500 or for the Russell, it appears that those analyst estimates are actually accelerating.  As a former banker, I will admit to some bias in these numbers, but they’ve been tracking reasonably well.  The forward estimates are that corporate profits should be up something like 16 percent.  So one of the things that we can do over the next several meetings is see how actual results track against those expectations, and my bet is that there will not be as much disappointment in those numbers as the top-down macroeconomic views would suggest.   Diving down into some of the individual markets, I suggest that they’re telling us different things about the state of the economy and the state of inflation prospects.  First, the equity markets have been off on the order of 7 or 8 percent, and many people, myself included, would have thought that that would have significantly affected CEO confidence, that it would have changed some perspectives about where they are in the capital expenditure cycle.  I think that probably has happened in the IPO market.  The IPO market has gotten slower and more selective, and issues that can come to market now have been at the top end of what’s in the pipeline.  If we look more broadly, however, beyond what’s going on in the equity markets, if we look at the cap-ex market, capital expenditures appear to be above plan generally from the discussions I’ve had with folks who are on boards of different companies.   One CEO called before coming out with a survey of CEO expectations for growth in capital expenditures, and he exclaimed, “What are you guys seeing that we’re not?”  In some way he was checking to try to understand what the reason was for concern when his company surveys continue to be quite positive.  The only caution I have is that, if you look across a this very moment that we’re having a discussion about the economy in transition.  The messages that come from the Fed and from other policymakers over the next month, including in the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, will be very important to set the tone, because CEOs are not sure whether to continue to hit the accelerator or whether this might be a time in their own businesses for a pause in capital expenditures.  I have a few comments on a couple of other markets.  Normally in a time like this, when the equity markets are off 7, 8, or 9 percent, the merger and acquisition markets, which I view as a pretty good proxy for CEO confidence, would stop.  In fact, that hasn’t happened:  M&A pipelines are more robust than ever.  The unthinkable deals are being printed and being published.  Pipelines are terrifically strong, and CEOs are ready in some ways to “bet the company” on the strength of their convictions—another reason that I have confidence that business growth could well be in excess of the Greenbook estimates.  Let me make two or three other comments.  First, in terms of inflation, as I look at the commodity markets and at the TIPS markets, I’m most comforted not so much by relative moves, because those TIPS markets are certainly not perfect in describing inflation expectations, but by the responsiveness of those markets to remarks that have come from folks around this table.  That is, if we think about what our authority is in influencing inflation expectations, the very real-time changes in the TIPS markets give me comfort that at this point in the cycle we will be able, with proper and appropriate policies that we’ll discuss tomorrow, to change those inflation expectations rather dramatically.  So I think that’s a reasonably comforting idea. Finally, the fixed-income markets and high-yield markets certainly have moved higher in terms of spreads but, again, not a lot by historical perspectives.  Under normal market conditions or more-pessimistic market conditions than we have now, that move, even a small relative move, would have slowed down those pipelines.  Instead, liquidity is plentiful.  A couple of anecdotes that we heard before describe the situation:  25 or 30 basis points in the high-yield markets are not changing activity.  They’re not changing the interest of investment banks and issuers in coming to market as quickly as they can.  So in terms of market functioning, apart from price, those markets are working exceptionally well.   What would be a reason for pessimism, and what would be a reason to think that the volatility that has been discussed over the past several weeks might turn into real volatility?  One thing that I look to with some degree of concern is the prices that are being paid and the leverage that’s being put on companies that could change the liquidity in those markets very quickly.  I wouldn’t be surprised to find—over the forecast period for sure and maybe even over 2006—a “club” deal in which many private equity partners group together in a highly leveraged situation to buy a very large public company and take it private and, after the course of due diligence and of that acquisition, the deal closes and they find that they missed the first coupon.  That is, the leverage that is being put on these companies, for all the reasons we have discussed around this table, is relatively remarkable.  Those leverage ratios used to sound like purchase prices, and they’re expecting meaningful cost savings that can come out of these businesses six and nine months out.  I suppose I’m concerned that, as these deals come together, there might be a negative surprise that affects the company so that the first coupon would be impossible or difficult to meet.  In that circumstance, all the optimism that I’ve described in terms of these debt you, Mr. Chairman.    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.    MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting I believe Dave Stockton, when he was describing the outlook, said that he was a bit schizophrenic about it.  Given the comments of President Moskow, it is clear that he is no longer schizophrenic but that one side has taken over—the dark side.  [Laughter]   That does not seem to reflect exactly where everyone is, but I think the issues that have been brought out in the Greenbook are extremely important to consider.  I, too, have knocked down my growth estimates a bit, although not quite as much as the Greenbook; and I, too, as many people have said, share a concern that some of the numbers coming in on both headline and core inflation are a bit higher than I had hoped, although I think they are still not out of a manageable range.   Obviously, payroll employment growth is a bit less robust than in the previous forecast.  Since that forecast, we’ve had a little more cooling in housing and some softening of retail demand.  I take a slightly different view of the high tax receipts that have been pouring into the Treasury because they are not only corporate tax receipts but also individual tax receipts.  In some sense that’s putting a bit of a drag on real disposable income because people seem to be paying a little more in taxes and, at the same time, labor costs and pay have not been going up.  So taxes are potentially a bit of a drag, and the Administration seems able to pursue a tighter expenditure policy this year than it has in the past, so we won’t be getting as much of a boost on the fiscal side as we have had.   A number of bright spots have been mentioned here, particularly related to business fixed investment, durable goods orders, and business confidence.  But what are some of the key risks through it in more detail.  I noted, as Governor Bies did, the importance of cancellations in suggesting a change in the way people are dealing with these markets.  If cancellations go up significantly, then a lot more housing stock that is searching for a buyer could be left on the the equivalent of the toaster is perhaps being given out.  Such incentives are not showing up in the reported housing price, but other adjustments are.  I’m not quite as optimistic about world economic growth as the forecast is.  I think a lot of uncertainties exist there.  We have seen and are seeing a lot of elections, particularly in emerging markets.  Mexico obviously has one coming up very soon, which could have a significant effect on a very important trading partner of the United States.  Also, as a number of people have mentioned, we’re seeing a lot of policy tightening around the world.  The obvious question is whether the central banks outside the United States are behind the curve or ahead of the curve.  Well, wherever they are, they are moving along a curve, and they seem to be moving more aggressively than they have in the past.  I think the tightening is going to have more of an effect than has been embedded in a number of the forecasts, not only here but also at the IMF.   Another concern that I have relates to something that President Pianalto mentioned—a disconnect between the numbers that we’re seeing on consumption and business optimism about investment.  My concern is about what’s going to be happening to demand for their products down the line.  It’s certainly disconcerting to hear that one of the largest private institutions in the world—Wal-Mart—is missing its growth targets fairly significantly.  They are a very important part of retail sales.  One could even say that they effectively know what retail sales are before the numbers are reported because their sales are so highly correlated with overall retail more toward business investment and a little away from consumption, but if we move too much away from consumption, the demand won’t be there to make the investment pay off.  We saw a bit of this in the late 1990s as we moved much more in the investment direction, but the investment turned out not to have the kinds of returns that people were expecting.  Now we’re in a very fortunate situation because, even if those returns decline dramatically, a lot of profitability is out there, as Governor Warsh said.  So profits could drop quite significantly, but we’re not going to see a real problem in the corporate sector, as we might have in other circumstances.  I don’t want to overemphasize this concern, but to me it’s a bit of a puzzle, and I see it definitely as a risk.    Turning to the inflation outlook, people have mentioned both here and publicly a cavalcade of concerns about the upticks in PCE and CPI core numbers, which have helped in turn to reduce inflation expectations.  Term premiums continue to remain low, and forward rates continue to remain low.  Often inflation seems to have a bit of momentum—it continues to move up or stays elevated—even as the economy begins to slow a bit.  We have to be careful in economy slows.  We have seen a dramatic change in commodity prices since our last meeting.  Basically, within a few days of the meeting on May 10, almost all the major commodities, whether copper, gold, or whichever one you want, came to a peak.  Since then, oil has come down a little, although not all that much.  I think it’s heartening for the inflation outlook going forward that those elevated levels didn’t stay that elevated.  Although those commodity prices are much higher in 2006 than they had been previously, oil prices have not increased that much during 2006. So what’s going to happen to core inflation going forward?  I think the excellent presentation that we had, in particular the discussion of the attempts to see how well we are modeling historical inflation and inflation going forward, shows that we have a long way to go and that we don’t really understand those dynamics very well.  I share Governor Kohn’s intuition, for the reasons that he articulated, that core inflation going forward will soften a bit more than the Greenbook projects.  I’m not going to repeat those reasons; but as Governor Kohn said, there’s a lot of uncertainty about them, and we don’t understand all that much.   Ultimately, as a number of people have mentioned, it comes down a lot to the type of statements that we make, the credibility that we have.  That’s true not only here but around the world, where we are seeing inflation rates and expected inflation rates come down quite a bit.  That’s something that ultimately we control very directly.  In today’s circumstances, when inflation is not really out of control but is moving up a little, being very clear about what our concerns are can have benefits in bringing down expectations and perhaps changing the inflation dynamic.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  If I could try your patience for a few more minutes at the end of a long afternoon, I’d like to summarize what I’ve heard today and then just add a few comments of my own.  While I’m doing that, Brian, would you distribute table 1?    Table 1 in the Bluebook shows the three alternative suggestions for the statement.  Since the Bluebook, we have received some suggestions, and we’ve done some wordsmithing—we’ve actually responded to a few things we heard today.  The general tone of the three statements is the same, but we wanted you to see where it was today, so that you could think about it overnight and so that it would help you for your discussion tomorrow.  That’s going to be coming around. Let me just briefly summarize what I heard.  Certainly, a central theme of the speakers today was the increase of uncertainty and risk in the environment.  It’s getting more and more difficult to forecast, and there are certainly risks both to the upside and to the downside.    The central tendencies with respect to output seem to be that output is slowing to something close to potential.  Some felt growth would be stronger than the Greenbook suggested; others, like the Greenbook, thought it would be falling somewhat below potential.  A few people saw downside risks from previous tightening.  There was some disagreement on the extent to which financial conditions are supportive of the economy, and some disagreement on consumption, although there was a view that lower-income consumers were going to do worse than higher-income consumers.  Housing is certainly slowing.  Some took the view that it was slowing more or less as expected, whereas some thought the slowing was somewhat worse than expected—certainly that’s a source of downside risk.  The view of the labor market is that it remains reasonably healthy, that it’s difficult to find skilled workers, but there are still few signs of wage pressures in the economy.  The business-sector evaluations were much more upbeat, with ongoing expansion, good sentiment, and capital investment.  Finally, there seems to be considerable unease about recent inflation developments.  Everyone considered these recent developments to be unwelcome.  Some felt that the recent increase in inflation might be temporary.  Others saw it as more persistent.  But there certainly was a sense that it’s a risk to the economy.  Let me add just a few thoughts about the situation.  The situation is, I think, exceptionally complicated because at least three different things are going on.  First of all, there’s a cyclical transition from a period of above-trend growth to what we would hope would be a period of trend growth, the normal soft-landing problem.  Second, we essentially have a supply shock.  It’s commodity prices are rising significantly, and that is creating a worsened tradeoff.  Third, we are having a housing cycle that has a certain autonomous component to it because it’s like any other asset-price correction taking place on its own schedule, so to speak, and it is interacting with the other two forces.  So given these three things occurring at the same time, the situation is obviously very complicated.     Now, the ideal situation would be for us to move to a steady, sustainable pace without inflation.  Right now, the biggest risk to that steady pace seems to be the pickup that we’ve seen recently in inflation.  The main point I want to make about inflation—many points have already been made—is that it really is quite broad-based. I think there are good reasons to downweight, to some extent, owners’ equivalent rent.  It is arguably a cost of living; however, the effects of monetary policy on this kind of cost of living are somewhat ambiguous.  So we could get ourselves into a bad situation if we focus on it too much.  But having said that, if you slice, say, core PCE in any other way—if you look, for example, at core PCE prices excluding OER, at core goods, at core PCE services excluding OER, at market-based core PCE less OER, at any of these ways of slicing inflation—you get a similar pattern in terms of the three-month, six-month, and twelve-month averages, which suggests a broad-based acceleration and one that I think we should be concerned about.  We should also note that the three-month total PCE inflation rate is 5.2, which is significant because it influences inflation expectations overall.     Now, a concern that we all have—and many people expressed—is that we don’t fully understand why this sudden acceleration is taking place.  Some of the possibilities are, first, the supply-shock increases of energy prices; second, the tight product markets; and third, changes in inflation psychology, perhaps related to headline inflation.  I guess I would just raise the to pass through your energy costs or your commodity costs.  That pass-through interacts with higher inflation psychology, and there’s maybe a vicious cycle there.  The thing we should be concerned about is whether those higher prices then lead to higher wage pressures in an inverse kind of spiral.  So I do have concerns about inflation, although I don’t want to exaggerate.  I think we’re still looking at numbers that are historically not extremely high.  The other big issue is the housing cycle.  I’m going to give us a bit of perspective.  It is a good thing that housing is cooling.  If we could wave a magic wand and reinstate 2005, we wouldn’t want to do that because the market has to come back to equilibrium.  The level of activity now is about a third bigger than it was in during the boom in the late 1990s.  The housing construction industry is large, bigger than historically normal, and a controlled decline in housing obviously is helpful to us at this stage in bringing us to a soft landing in the economy.  But as people have pointed out, the cooling is an asset-price correction.  Like any other asset-price correction, it’s very hard to forecast, and consequently it is an important risk and one that should lead us to be cautious in our policy decisions, as we’ll talk about tomorrow.   Another potential nonlinearity is in financial markets, as we’ve seen recently.  We don’t have a good understanding of how changes in interest rates are affecting risk reduction and positions in financial markets right now.  Just a bit of commentary on consumption:  A lot of our uncertainty—I guess you’d call it model uncertainty—is the question about how a decline in housing prices will affect consumer spending.  The range of views is wide, some arguing that, because of equity withdrawal and so on, the effect would be very large.  I don’t know the answer to that question, obviously, but I think there are some positive factors that will support consumption going forward.  To name a low, and I suspect that wages and incomes will start to rise sometime soon.  Consumer confidence is not that bad.  Gasoline prices are likely to come down.  In part, they are reflecting high ethanol prices, which will come down over time.  We’ve seen before that consumer confidence can be very sensitive to gasoline prices.  Balance sheets remain reasonably healthy.  Even if housing prices flatten out, people have accumulated a lot of equity, and the implication of that is that they can smooth their consumption through rough times, if necessary, by drawing on that equity.  Finally, Kevin and Randy, I think, gave different sides of the surge in tax collections, but on the whole it is probably a positive sign.  It probably suggests there is more economic activity than we are capturing.  So let me just conclude by reiterating that we find ourselves in an extraordinarily complicated situation because we have these different themes—the cyclical turning point, the supply shock, and the housing cycle.  The implication is that, whatever we do, we’re going to have to be very deliberate and careful; but I think we cannot ignore the inflation side of this equation.   Any other comments?  Well, thank you again for your patience in a long afternoon.  I’m glad this is a two-day meeting.  [Laughter]  Everyone should have table 1; I don’t expect significant changes before tomorrow.  I’ll see you tonight at the British Embassy, and we will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00. [Meeting recessed]  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everyone.  Mr. Reinhart. MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, market participants marked up their expectations of policy action at this and subsequent FOMC meetings, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Apparently, the upward impetus of stronger-than-anticipated releases on inflation and statements by Federal Reserve officials more than offset the drag of readings on economic activity that had a soft cast.  The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next two years, the middle left panel, had shifted 25 to 35 basis points by the time of the publication of the Bluebook.  In the week since, those expectations edged higher still, with investors sure of a ¼ point hike today and expecting more of the same by autumn.  As has been true for a while, the funds rate is apparently seen by investors as trailing off subsequently—with your last ¼ point rise rolling off in 2007.  Three explanations have been offered for this inversion of the money market futures curve, as noted in the middle right panel.  The first, which is probably more popular inside this building than outside it, is that it may well be optimal to raise the nominal funds rate in response to a temporary bulge in inflation so as to keep the real interest rate from falling.  As inflation recedes, the nominal funds rate can be reduced so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising.  Such a path has been a common feature of the Bluebook exercises we’ve shown you when the Committee is assumed to desire an inflation goal below the prevailing rate of inflation.  The second explanation is based on an assumed nonlinearity in the housing outsized expectations of capital gains, expectations that for a time have been impervious to the level of the policy rate.  In such a circumstance, the FOMC has to tighten to the point that it gets the attention of those investors.  But when it does get their attention and housing demand softens suddenly, the Committee will have to change gears quickly.  The third explanation relates to a hardy perennial in FOMC transcripts.  Over the years, many of you or your former colleagues have said that your last action in any phase of a policy cycle is always a mistake.  And you can’t look at the current configuration of futures rates without wondering whether it is happening again.  The Committee might, however, be willing to accept tilted odds of over-tightening if that were judged to be the least unattractive alternative.  That is, a funds rate a little higher than that consistent with full resource utilization for a time may be seen as the necessary cost of countering inflation that has risen above your comfort zone.  Note also that the extent to which markets view you as rolling back some portion of your anticipated 50 basis points of additional firming will lessen the consequences of that near-term policy path for the prices of longer-lived assets and, presumably, aggregate demand. 3 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). As can be seen in the second column of the table at the bottom left, the upward revision to near-term policy expectations flattened the yield curve somewhat, with rates on two-year Treasury notes rising 30 basis points compared with the 13 basis point gain in their ten-year counterparts.  As the bars at the right show, the rise in nominal rates was more than accounted for by an increase in their real components, especially at short maturities, and inflation compensation edged lower.  This rise in real rates, along with the decline in equity values shown in the bottom two rows of the table, implies that financial market conditions tightened over the intermeeting period.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 2, such a tightening, against the backdrop of weakish data on spending, might incline you to keep the funds rate unchanged at 5 percent today.  Such concerns would be particularly acute if you interpreted the anecdotes and survey measures of participants in the housing housing slump than embedded in the staff forecast.  But you might see some reason to pause now even if you bought into the basic contours of the Greenbook outlook.  Estimated policy rules explaining the Committee’s behavior over the past eighteen years that are fed outcomes for inflation and the output gap as in the staff forecast (plotted as the dashed lines in the middle right panel) predict that you will be lowering the policy rate.  Similarly, the simulations shown in the Bluebook and repeated in the remaining panel suggest that, with a 2 percent inflation goal and specific assumptions about your preferences, you’d also be satisfied with a funds rate no higher than 5 percent.  In that scenario, however, you’d be willing to accept core PCE inflation (the bottom right figure) running at 2⅜ percent for almost one year.  Market participants, in part learning from your public comments, evidently view you as unwilling to accept such an outcome.  And if your own assessment of the economy has evolved in the same direction as that of the staff, then your near-term policy choices have probably gotten more unpalatable.    As can be seen in the top panel of exhibit 3, the Greenbook outlook for unemployment (at the left) and for core PCE inflation (at the right) has worsened over the course of this year.  We tried in the Bluebook to summarize the net consequence of the changes over the past six months in the forces shaping the economy using the FRB/US model.  In those simulations, repeated in the middle panel, the policy that best accomplishes the assumed objectives and the resulting macroeconomic outcomes given by the current outlook (the solid lines) are compared with those implied by the extended outlook at the time of the January Bluebook (the dashed lines).  In each of these simulations, policymakers are assumed to have a long-run inflation goal of 1½ percent and to place equal weights on the three stabilization objectives:  output, inflation, and policy stability.  The current outlook implies a funds rate path that peaks a bit above 5½ percent in mid-2007 and then declines gradually to about 4½ percent by 2010, noticeably above the rate call in January.  financial markets, is the rise in far-ahead inflation compensation, the red-dotted line in the bottom panel, over the past year.  True, you may be heartened that inflation compensation has moved lower since the outbreak of jitters in late April and that, as noted in the inset box, changes in policy expectations prompted by official statements appear to have been associated with a decline in far-ahead inflation compensation.  But concerns about investors’ confidence in your commitment to price stability, witnessed by the positive correlation of data surprises and inflation compensation over the same period, are probably at the root of a decision to tighten at least 25 basis points today and signal that more may come, the subject of exhibit 4.  As can be seen in the top panel, a ¼ point move today would position the real funds rate more assuredly above the center of staff estimates of its neutral level.  And putting some weight on the simulations presented in the Bluebook, if your inflation goal is 1½ percent, as in the middle panel, you may see the need to move the nominal funds rate up from 5 percent sometime soon.  Indeed, if you put a particularly high priority of the attainment of that goal—as in the dashed lines—even more tightening is in store.  As shown in the bottom panel, the prevailing market sentiment is toward a ¼ point firming today, which has been a compelling, but not conclusive, argument for action in the past.  The key question for each of you is, What probability do you place on another ¼ point firming in August?  The solid line in the bottom left figure plots the implied probability currently in financial markets of tightening at both the June and the August FOMC meetings.  When drafting the statement, we thought an 80 percent market probability of such a dual action was on the high side of what you would prefer.  So, in table 1, which is updated as your last exhibit, we put a few asserts that growth is moderating and repeats reasons that inflation might be held in check.  More important, the assessment of risk is also couched in terms of your goals rather than just the policy instrument.  My bet is that, with the release of the statement, the odds would go to 50-50 on action in August, but you should probably view that as no more informative than the flip of a coin.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any questions for Vincent?  If not, then we’re ready to start  the go-round on policy.  Governor Kohn.  MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the alternative B action of 25 basis points and the language in the statement that was passed out last night.  Although output has softened, it’s not clear how much and for how long.  What is clear is that inflation has been running higher.  That’s a given.  That has been in the data. We’ve had some warning over the past weeks and months that inflation expectations aren’t as firmly anchored as we might have hoped they were.  They have come down a bit, but when they’ve edged back down, it has been largely on expectations that we would be firming at this meeting and on the marking up of our path.  So I think it’s important to cement that in and to take that action today.  It’s important to recognize the inflation risks that we all acknowledged in our discussion yesterday.  I think 50 basis points would be too much.  The economy is slowing.  There has been a considerable tightening of financial conditions over this year.  Long-term interest rates are up 50 to 75 basis points over the past six months, including 50 basis points in real rates.  This increase wasn’t just inflation expectations.  Some of the increase has happened over the past couple of months, and I think it’s quite likely that we haven’t seen the full effects of those rate increases on activity.  So we already have some slowing of activity, and I think there’s a little more to come, or at least some additional damping from tightening in the pipeline.  We do need to keep our eye on the forecast here.  As I said yesterday, a good deal of the inflation increase that we’ve gotten has been a consequence of energy prices and maybe the price effects in owners’ equivalent rent, which are so difficult to analyze and predict.  These price effects should dissipate, so I’m certainly expecting inflation to come down as they come out.  We need to be careful about inflation expectations and not overreact to incoming data on inflation, but we shouldn’t ignore them either.  I think that would be a mistake.  The whole thing is very uncertain, and I think that inflation, even after a move of 25 basis points, will remain the greatest risk to our objectives, at least until we get much more data that growth indeed is slowing to below potential. In that regard, I like the elements in the alternative B statement.  In paragraph 2, it’s important to acknowledge that we recognize that the economy is moderating.  That was a prediction last time, and I think we can be confident enough to say it’s an actuality this time, to recognize that a lot of that slowing is in the housing market, and to recognize the lagged effect of increases in interest rates.  It’s important for the rest of the world to know that we have our eye on that.  In paragraph 3, we need, as I said, to acknowledge that inflation has been too high and that there are some things working in a good direction, such as productivity gains and unit labor costs.  There is a risk that inflation could remain higher than we want it to.    In paragraph 4, it’s important to recognize that the slowing of growth should help to limit inflation pressures, at least keep them from building further, but that our primary focus is on inflation risks.  This is a good time to step back a bit from predicting where interest rates are going to go because I think we’re less certain about where they are going to go, and so I was glad to see “some further policy firming may yet be needed” was taken out.  We still have a prediction in there by saying “the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed.”  It should be clear that in the view of the Committee the next move is more likely to be up than down.  But it’s a less definitive statement than it was before, and I think it’s appropriate to take that slight step back at this time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  As I said yesterday, although the outlook for real growth is noticeably softer than it was at the last meeting, it doesn’t seem to me clearly inconsistent with growth around trend going forward.  I see the risk of slowing the economy overly much in the near term by increasing real rates as relatively low. The way I look at the evidence, real short-term interest rates are still somewhat low by historical standards.  If you compare the periods of extended growth, such as the late 1990s, it looks as though they come in between 3 and 5 percent and center near 4 percent or so, although I know there are many ways to measure them.  Right now it appears that, by the same sort of measurement, the real funds rate is between 2½ and 3 percent.  So I still sense that the real rate is low by historical standards for a period of economic expansion like the one we seem to be in now.  My sense is that we may need to raise rates beyond today because it seems clear to me that we’re not pleased with recent inflation or the inflation outlook.  The rate of inflation has been substantially higher over the past few months than we would like, and I think the level of inflation expectations is too high as well, although I recognize some of the subtleties involved in gauging inflation expectations accurately.  Moreover, inflation expectations appear to be unnecessarily fluctuating; we’ve been on something of a rollercoaster ride for the past few months.  Inflation expectations rose when the public wasn’t sure how we would respond to the oil-price shocks, just as they did after Katrina, and inflation expectations came down as they did last October and November only after we communicated our intentions.  These ups and downs really serve no useful purpose in my view.  Last night at dinner, Rachel Lomax made a relevant remark about the extent to which their regime anchors inflation expectations and causes firms to adjust to oil-price increases, not by passing through but by cutting wages and costs elsewhere.  I think that’s a relevant example here.  To say that some inflation currently is a consequence of oil-price increases is incomplete, as we all know, because the extent to which oil-price increases pass through to overall inflation being in place by the public.  Now, I’m not going to claim that this is the end of the world.  This isn’t the 1970s.  I think the credibility of our commitment to not let inflation rise to 10 percent is very secure.  But we ought to be able to improve upon a policy regime and an accompanying equilibrium in which expectations for ten-year-ahead inflation fluctuate as much as they have over the past several months.  So I agree with Governor Kohn that we ought to raise rates at this meeting.  We ought to leave open the option in our statements that we could raise rates again.  I think it’s very important to use today’s statement to clarify our intentions regarding inflation; otherwise we’re likely to be in for more rollercoaster rides in the months and quarters ahead.  I have two concrete recommendations about the statement.  First, note that on June 1 the Chairman characterized recent inflation readings as “unwelcome”—a very important word that harkens back to the word the Committee used in 2003 to communicate a lower bound on the range of inflation rates the Committee considered consistent with price stability.  We should use that word again today in our statement to communicate that we do not view current inflation readings as consistent with price stability.  I’m afraid that failing to do so would be a glaring omission and would unnecessarily perpetuate ambiguity about our intentions.  My second recommendation about the statement has to do with the assessment of risk, the first sentence in alternative B, row 4, that reads, “Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.”  Placing anticipation of an aggregate demand slowdown front and center in our assessment of inflation dynamics seems odd to me in light of all of the talk around this table over the recent years about how flat the relationship is between aggregate demand and that we’re willing to simply wait for a moderation of inflation rather than take sufficient action ourselves.  Given the Greenbook’s forecast, it asks a relatively modest output gap to do a whole lot of work.  It also—but this is a sort of broader doctrinal issue—risks leaving the impression that our methodology for controlling inflation is to manipulate aggregate demand, and I’m not sure that’s entirely accurate.  The assessment-of-risk sentence in alternative C would be much more appropriate than the first sentence in alternative B.  It states clearly what we would like to see happen with inflation:  “In order to foster price stability and a sustainable economic growth, the Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels.”  My sense is that this is something that everyone around the table wants—a medium-term decline in core inflation; if that’s the case, we ought to state it clearly to the public.  These two changes would send a much clearer message about our focus on inflation risks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll start by saying that I support 25 basis points today.  Many of us, including especially the Chairman, helped to shape market expectations that we’re going to do that today, and I think not to carry through, given that we shaped market expectations, would be very unfortunate.  Before I get to the statement, I want to try to state as clearly as I can what my position is on the substance of what we ought to do, thinking about the clarity in the formulation of the statement as having to precede the discussion of it with the public.  I was struck in our discussion yesterday by the differences around the table in the degree of optimism about the real economy.  The Greenbook outlook is perhaps on the low side of the range around the table, and some of Greenbook outcome.  Others are more optimistic than the Greenbook, and they put some weight on a stronger outcome than even their point estimate.  So that produces a range of views about the real economy, but I believe that the range is well within the normal bounds of professional disagreement and well within the normal forecast errors.  Now, how would we characterize our policy stance coming out of this meeting, assuming that we raise 25 basis points?  I think that the right way to characterize the stance, and this is what I was trying to say in the memo that I distributed earlier, is that a fed funds rate of 5.25 percent would be a stance of mild restraint.  Let me give you just a short list of some of the things that lead me to believe that.  This list is in no particular order, although I suppose it’s not an accident that I’m going to put money growth at the top of the list.  We have slow and, indeed, slowing growth of MZM (Money Zero Maturity) and M2, particularly in recent weeks; I don’t put a lot of weight on the short-run information that we get, but what we see is consistent with the view that policy has mild restraint.  We’ve had some persistent increase in real rates of interest this year, particularly, as Jeff Lacker noted, since our last meeting.  We’ve had some modest declines in U.S. equity markets—that is consistent with mild restraint.  We’ve had some dollar appreciation since the May FOMC meeting.  We’ve observed pretty clearly some reduced activity in sectors of the economy that are interest sensitive, particularly housing, and interest sensitivity may have something to do with automobiles as well.  There have been some modest chart against the context of what has happened.  Perhaps there are some other things that you would want to add to the list, but I don’t see anything out there that would be a clear indication on the other side that would say that it is a glaring exception to the list of things that I’ve given. So I think we have a stance of modest restraint.  It could well be that we will need additional restraint in the future, but we should not have a clear presumption that we will be raising the funds rate in the future.  The decision in August should depend on all the information that we get between now and August, and we should not try to build in a particular assumption on the policy decision.  In fact, if I were to be as neutral as I can be on this, I would say something like 50 percent odds that we would hold steady in August and 50 percent odds of another 25 basis point raise.  You could take the mean of that and say, “Well, let’s just be done with it today and raise the funds rate an additional 12½ basis points.”  [Laughter]  But I think that would be pretty silly.  The message we ought to give to the market is that we have mild restraint in place, and we don’t know whether or not that will be enough to do the job.  But if we get some unfortunate additional news about the current inflation readings, which I think we could easily get, I don’t want to be in a position in which I have to prove my manhood, so to speak, by proposing that we have more draconian increases in rates.  If we believe that we already have mild restraint in place and over time it is going to be enough to do the job, then we don’t want to position ourselves that in response to market expectations we have to act more.  Now, I don’t know that we have enough in place, but I don’t want to have a presumption that what’s in place is inadequate at this point.  I think that the inflation we have, including the energy situation, is predominantly from worldwide demand; we’re making a mistake if we ascribe very much of it to supply shocks.  We’ve had a very strong worldwide expansion.  We know that China is soaking up energy like crazy—that’s part of the very strong worldwide demand situation.  Of course, some of the Chinese success comes back to produce demand in the United States:  They’ve ordered a lot of aircraft from Boeing, for example.   Now I’m going to get to the statement itself.  All the alternatives help to create a presumption about the August meeting.  I understand from the paper this morning that the market has now bid into it a probability of a move in August of more like 85 percent rather than 70.  That obviously fluctuates from day to day.  But we shouldn’t produce a presumption.  The way to avoid creating a presumption but at the same time to emphasize our concern about inflation is to say, as I suggested in the memorandum I distributed, that we believe that we have mild restraint in place, assuming that that view is accepted around the table (which it may well not be), and that we will act in August on the basis of the incoming information, which may change the outlook that we get.  So that’s where I come out on this.  Thank you.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker and President Poole have made some specific suggestions.  If additional speakers want to comment, that would be very helpful.  Thank you.  President Yellen.  MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Based purely on the economic data, I consider it a close call between raising the funds rate 25 basis points today and pausing.  I definitely think that policy should have a firming bias because inflation is too high.  However, I do consider policy to be mildly restrictive, and I see a lot of uncertainty right now about the prospects for both real GDP and inflation.  My preference would be to move up a bit more slowly, if in fact it turns out that we do need to tighten more, in order to allow additional time to assess the economic situation as we go.  In other words, the option value of pausing, especially in view of how close the next meeting is, would have ideally, in my view, made it preferable to pause on purely economic grounds today.  There is a wide range of possibilities for the future.  I am deeply concerned about the pace of core inflation in recent months, but as I said yesterday, I take comfort from the continued certainly is a possibility that inflation will remain where it is or pick up even more than we have seen so far, and in that case, further action will surely be required to bring it under control.  I’m also quite aware of the possibility that output will slow much more than the Greenbook expects and that the rise in inflation we’ve seen recently will turn out to be a temporary bulge.  Financial conditions have tightened considerably, and we may regret not getting off the escalator of raising the funds rate at each and every meeting because, if in fact output does slow down even more than the Greenbook projects, we will probably overshoot the appropriate level of the funds rate, perhaps by a considerable amount.  In response to President Lacker’s comment about how we affect inflation, it seems to me that we do affect inflation by manipulating aggregate demand.  That is the channel through which monetary policy works.  To my mind we have two goals, not one, and we are now in a regime with mildly restrictive policy so that we face a tradeoff between the pace at which we’re going to bring inflation back to our target and the path of unemployment along the route.  So although on purely economic grounds I’d prefer to pause at this meeting, I certainly recognize that it would be difficult to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this time.  In general, I believe that we should do the right thing, even if it surprises markets, but in this case our public statements seem to have convinced the public that we will raise the funds rate today.  If we didn’t follow through, there would likely be some loss of credibility for policy.  Moreover, as I’ve indicated, I see today’s call as an exceptionally close one between firming and pausing.  Therefore, I can certainly support another increase in the funds rate of 25 basis points today.  With respect to the statement, in response to Vince’s point about what our policy choice is today, I believe our objective should be to craft wording that lowers the market’s assessment 85 percent at this point.  The revised statement does an excellent job in accomplishing that, and I endorse the analysis of the statement that Governor Kohn gave as he went through the various parts.  I do find, however, that I’m also attracted to the wording suggested by President Poole as an alternative.  It’s another way to accomplish the same thing, and it has the added attraction of including the statement that we judge our stance after today’s move as mildly restrictive.  It does open up the distinct possibility of our pausing in August, depending on the information we receive. To my mind, there is a real policy challenge as we go forward.  Policy—I agree with President Poole—is mildly restrictive:  The Greenbook forecast has unemployment moving above the NAIRU and inflation gradually coming down.  However, assuming that the inflation bulge is not a purely transitory one that will disappear rapidly, the process for inflation to move down is going to take a while.  The communication challenge I think we face and will face for quite a while is how we will live through a period in which inflation exceeds our objective.  We need to express the idea that that is an unacceptable long-run situation.  But I endorse the comments that President Poole made:  We have to make sure that every time we receive an adverse inflation reading—and that could occur for quite some time while the medicine of our policy is working—we don’t respond by raising the funds rate again.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I’d like to build on the comments by President Lacker, President Poole, and President Yellen.  I want to address the language first and the move second.  Following President Lacker’s lead of referring to last night’s dinner, I want to go back to a statement that Governor King made last week—that the Bank of England’s approach is to keep reason that they don’t know and it would be quite misleading to pretend otherwise.  Listening to my colleagues at the table and addressing President Poole’s point and my own concerns, I don’t know where we’ll go in August.  I do think we should keep it simple.    In terms of the wording—and I’ll get to the move in just a minute—it strikes me that the first sentence in alternative B as to the rationale is correct and in keeping with what we’ve heard at this table.  I would then move on—I agree with President Lacker—to say what we set out to do.  But “ongoing productivity gains” and “contained inflation expectations should restrain inflation going forward” is the wording from alternative C, the second paragraph of the rationale.  I don’t like the word “readings” because—and President Yellen has made a very good point—we don’t want to be viewed as reactive.  I’d prefer the word “pressures”:  “However, recent pressures on core inflation have been elevated, which the Committee views as unwelcome.”  Then I agree with President Lacker—to clarify our intention, I would not use in alternative B the paragraph 4 that we have.  I wouldn’t use any of it, and I’ll come to the reason in a second.  I would just say that “in order to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its current elevated levels.”  By the way, I don’t like the second sentence of paragraph 4 in the current alternative B because, as a former market operator, I take from it that we intend to raise rates again.  The slippage in there revolves around the words “any additional firming” and the word “may.” Again, given my background, I read from those words that we’re biased toward raising rates again, and I don’t think that’s where we are.  At least that’s not where I am.  I would also make a plea, which I think I do at almost every meeting, to eliminate from row 5 the words “in any event” and just say, “The Committee will respond to changes.”   As to the move itself, the real epiphany I had last night was after dinner driving home.  I’m about to go on vacation, and I was thinking about golf—besides the wisdom that I garnered at dinner.  In thinking about golf, I was thinking about the U.S. Open.  What happened at the U.S. Open was that the fellow who was in the lead, Phil Mickelson, went for broke.  The fact is that this is a team sport.  (By the way, Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate you for the way you conduct these meetings, because I really do feel—and I think all of us feel—as part of a team.)  But the sequence of events here is that we’re going to release a statement after we announce our move, you’re going to testify on monetary policy, and then the minutes are going to be released, if I understand the time sequence correctly.  The markets look to the Chairman.  Even though this is a team sport, you can go back in history, and you can think of various analogies.  Just to kill my golfing analogy here, we might consider Paul Volcker as Bobby Jones and Alan Greenspan as an octogenarian Tiger Woods, and so on.  Your words will be carefully weighed.  In arguing for a sparse statement, I think the market will be focused on what you say, and then it will look at the minutes, and that’s where we amplify, if we wish to amplify or respond to incoming data.  Just to finish the golf analogy, I think our job in terms of the amount that we move is to put the ball back onto the fairway so you can approach the green.  I think 25 basis points is the best alternative, so I support the 25 basis point move, and I would urge you to consider the wording changes that have been put forth by President Lacker and by President Poole.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is that two-handed?  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Richard, let me just clarify for a second.  So you think we should move today but then leave expectations flat, not 50-50 on another increase? MR. FISHER.  I don’t know where we’re going to go next.  I do believe we should move.  I also believe, by the way, that the economy is stronger than the Greenbook says.  I made that clear in my statement.  I was tempted to suggest adding “somewhat” after the word “moderating,” but moderating is moderating.  I’m not sure where we go next, and I’m not sure that we should signal because I think we don’t know.  This gets partially at President Yellen’s point and certainly to President Poole’s point.  The wording as it is, Tim, is too directive.  Like President Lacker, I would prefer to clarify our intention as it appears in column C here in the fourth box.  I don’t think we need to say much more and should leave amplification to the testimony and to the minutes.  That’s my point.  Does that answer your question?  VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Well, I would have a hard time reconciling Jeff’s comments with the ones that followed.  In some ways we need to make a choice.  It may be true that we’re not sure at this point what’s going to make sense beyond June, but we need to make a conscious choice about what we want to do with the expectations the market now has.  Therefore you can’t evade that reality.  You have to consciously decide what you want to do with those expectations.  You have to decide fundamentally whether you want to leave them neutral, push them down, or push them up.  I was trying to read where you would be on that spectrum.  MR. FISHER.  First of all, we announce a ¼ point move.  Second, we say that we are worried—we use the word “unwelcome.”  The inflationary pressures, the core inflation pressures, are unwelcome.  We state very clearly what our intention is, and we state that we’re going to respond to changes.   I think our action is then addressed in a very straightforward way by the words that we use without indicating that we’re likely to move still further, because I don’t have the confidence that we will move still further.  But we’re making it very clear we’re core.  VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  It sounds as though your objective with those changes would be to push up expectations.  MR. FISHER.  No, I don’t want to indicate that we’re going to move when we’re not sure we’re going to move.  VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I would have read the net effect of your proposed changes as pushing up expectations.  Even if we’re uncomfortable with how much confidence we have about where we want expectations to be, we need to make a choice about what we want to do.  And I would have read the net effect of those changes as pushing up expectations or leaving them unchanged.  MR. FISHER.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I disagree with the reading.  We come from different perspectives.  However, we do need to bear in mind that we have this statement, we have your testimony, we have the release of the minutes, and all of those are tools that we should use.  Let me just leave it at that.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Just a factual question.  Richard said that the sequence is that you testify first and then the minutes come out.  Is that accurate?  MR. REINHART.  The minutes are released three weeks from today.  Testimony is tentatively scheduled to be the day before and the same day.  Is that right, Brian?   MR. MADIGAN.  Yes. MR. REINHART.  So the testimony is Wednesday, and the minutes are released Thursday.  The first leg of the testimony is on Wednesday; the second leg is on Thursday.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I don’t disagree with the importance of trying to assess the effect of our statement on the immediate post-statement probability that the market places on our move in that assessment will in some sense swamp this.  How the markets react to that news and how they view us as likely reacting to that incoming news are going to be important.  I have expressed some dismay at what has happened between the March meeting and now.  I wasn’t unhappy with the March-meeting post-statement assessment by the markets.  I’m unhappy with the way the markets reacted to the news, how they inferred that we’d react to the news that came in.  So I think that, although the focus on what the likelihood is of a move in August is important, I don’t think we should lose sight of how we want markets to interpret incoming news and what that means for our policy going forward.  MR. FISHER.  The wording in alternative C—which says that, in order to foster price stability, we seek a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels—puts into context, President Lacker, how we’re likely to deal with intermeeting data.  That’s our intention.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  On Tim Geithner’s point, we come out of this meeting with a clear asymmetry in the sense that what’s on the table for August is either zero or up 25.  The question is, what kind of probability of up 25 would we like to encourage the markets to think about coming out of the meeting?   I said that I would like it to be sort of 50-50, and let the data between now and August determine the result and not go into the next meeting essentially having created the presumption of up 25.  That’s my position. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the ¼ point increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  There are lots of considerations that go into it, but a principal one in my mind is that it’s important, and perhaps essential, to take that action to anchor inflation expectations and perhaps even to reduce them a bit.  So that’s where I come out on the action.  As far as the statement is concerned, it seems to me that we want to strike some sort of balance between the possibility, maybe the probability, that we ought to increase the funds rate further, perhaps even more than once at subsequent meetings, with the possibility that we may also find it appropriate to pause, perhaps not too far off, partly because of the lags between our actions and their effects and the fact that we’ve moved quite a bit.  I used the language “some sort of balance” because, as I think the discussion has already suggested, it’s going to be very difficult to find something that I would consider fully appropriate and that everybody else around the table would find fully appropriate as well.  So I would be happy with any statement that strikes that balance in a reasonable way.  I think alternative B largely does that, and I can certainly go along with the language in B.  I’m going to resist the temptation to fine-tune it, except to tilt at one windmill and say that I wouldn’t use the word “unwelcome.”  If we want to make the point, we should say “too rapid,” “too high,” “inconsistent with price stability,” or something direct.  Why we would want to be coy isn’t clear to me.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given our recent disappointing inflation experience and, more important, our forecast that suggests that inflation is likely to move at least somewhat higher over the forecast period, I’m solidly in favor of a 25 basis point move today.  Like some others, I am less sure about the need for further increases at subsequent meetings. As yesterday’s discussion highlighted, our near-term policy decisions look to have become somewhat harder.  There is the possibility that output may be slipping to below potential, and inflation has yet to respond in any convincing way to the tighter policy.  Like others, even given that possible problem, I am more concerned about the upside inflation risk, given what I consider to be the greater consequences of an unwelcome development on the inflation side.  Despite that leaning, I would emphasize the increased uncertainty we now face and the need to maintain some flexibility with regard to our subsequent policy actions.  I want to go back to the last point I made, or tried to make, in yesterday’s discussion—the possible policy corner into which we may have unwittingly painted ourselves.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  In an effort to underscore our individual commitments to low inflation, many—and I think perhaps most—of us have over the last couple of years expressed a numerical range of price inflation that we would consider acceptable over the longer term.  While those ranges have not all been the same, 1 to 2 percent on the core PCE price measure has been the most often mentioned and the range many outside commentators have picked up as what they believe us to consider as our informal target.  The problem that we now face in my view is that our forecast for inflation over at least the near term, and perhaps extending into the intermediate term depending on how one defines that time period, does not have inflation moving down even to the upper end of that range.  I was struck by the tabulations of the forecasts we turned in for the upcoming congressional testimony.  Those showed a central tendency of 2¼ to 2½ percent core PCE inflation this year and 2 to 2¼ percent next year.  The staff forecasts were even higher, at 2.4 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year.  Using the confrontational language of one of my grandkids, I will say, “So?”  In other words, what are we going to do about it?  I think it’s important, we should be asking that question of ourselves.  I find it interesting to think back as to how we may have individually hit upon 1 to 2 percent core PCE inflation as reasonable and achievable.  I think it was substantially influenced by our very favorable experience during the 1996 to 2003 period, when we did have the measure comfortably within that range.  But a decomposition of core PCE inflation for that period suggests that such a benign experience may have been an aberration.  During that period, we experienced significant declines in goods prices, due largely to sharply lower worldwide demand and the persistent downward pressure on goods prices resulting from the emergence of China and other developing economies as goods producers.  That pattern of goods price deflation has now changed, and goods prices in the aggregate are now not making a large negative contribution to overall inflation.  In other words, it’s hard to attribute that brief historical period of low core inflation to our domestic monetary policy—it may have simply been good luck—and I think it’s a weak reed upon which to base our longer-run policy response and preference.  The scenario in the Greenbook that has below-trend growth, unemployment above 5¼ percent, and near-term inflation accelerating underscores the difficult policy choices we may face.  And the Bluebook’s modeling of what will be required to get inflation back under 2 percent is sobering.  Yet if we continue to espouse a target range of 1 to 2 percent and do not behave in a way that seems to move us decisively in that direction, then I think we run the risk of a substantial loss of policy credibility.   Finally, alternative C in today’s Bluebook table 1 hints at the kind of action and statement language that would seem to be consistent with a commitment to get back well within a range of remind us of the need to begin to have such a discussion around this table.  With regard to today’s statement, I like the way the various drafts have evolved, and I am generally comfortable with the latest alternative B language that we have before us.  I was very uncomfortable with earlier language that toyed with the notion of commenting on and forecasting several very specific variables.  I would urge us not to use the statement to elaborate on a rationale for our actions or to highlight a particular data series.  I believe that’s best left to the minutes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Guynn, I just want to make a comment that, when I give my testimony, I will have the Committee’s forecasts for year and a half ahead, which are conditioned on optimal monetary policy; so I’ll be able to say that this is what we think we can achieve reasonably over the next year and a half.  Any issue of where we may want to be in the very long run is, at this point, I think moot.  I take your point that we have not, as a committee, and perhaps we should be more cautious about that.  But in the near term, as Vincent’s simulation showed, getting to the 1.5 percent in the simulations takes us five years.  We don’t want to create an impression that we are trying to achieve that kind of objective in a year or a year and a half, and I will make that point very clear in my testimony.  President Pianalto.  MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With our decision in May to set the federal funds rate target at 5 percent, I felt that we had moved the fed funds rate to a level that was slightly above neutral.  I thought at that time that the cumulative effects of our previous actions, along with other elements in the outlook, might enable us to consider a pause at this meeting.  Others at that meeting weren’t quite as sanguine, and I said at that time that I perceived direction and looking for the data to talk them out of it and those who were leaning against an increase and looking for the data to talk them into it.    I was in that latter group, and the data have indeed talked me into another 25 basis point increase in our fed funds rate target today.  I’m just as wary now as I was in May of pushing the fed funds rate beyond the level necessary to restrain inflationary pressures, but my concerns about the real side of the economy have been trumped by what I perceive as a significant shift in the risk to our price stability objective.  For some time now, I’ve been expecting to see headline inflation slow down even as we see a drift up in core inflation.  We may yet find that some of the influences of energy and housing prices on the inflation statistics are transitory and that they’ll wane.  Nevertheless, I’m less confident of that position today than I was in May, and I can’t comfortably rationalize the recent string of bad inflation reports that we’ve seen.  Fortunately, some of the wobbliness in inflation expectations that concerned us in May appears to have stabilized because of the belief that the Committee will respond to the latest inflation reports with a rate increase today.  I think it’s important to validate those expectations.  As others stated previously, I’m also not prepared to say with any conviction today what I will be prepared to do in August.  As Vincent pointed out, the markets are currently expecting another rate increase in August.  I would prefer to see that probability closer to 50-50, and I hope that Vincent is correct that our language is going to move the markets in that direction.  In terms of our statement, I was ready to support President Lacker’s two suggestions in the statement, taking “unwelcome” inflation, which appears in both alternatives A and C, and using it in B.  But after hearing President Stern’s question about what it means, I’m not so sure the first sentence in paragraph 4 of alternative C and using it as the first sentence in alternative B, addresses those concerns.  It conveys that the Committee seeks a decline in core inflation, which is more specific than “unwelcome” inflation.  Even though I understand that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is through the slowing of aggregate demand, I would prefer that our statement be more forthright about what we are trying to achieve as an objective.  That’s what I think that sentence in alternative C does—it says that we are seeking to foster our objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth and are seeking to see a decline in core inflation.  So my preference is alternative B with a change in the first sentence in paragraph 4.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m in favor of increasing rates 25 basis points.  I like to think I’m in favor of it not because that’s what the markets expect but because it’s the right thing to do.  At some point, I hope we can surprise the markets by doing the right thing but not having it be necessarily what’s fully expected.  I’m in favor of the 25 basis points mostly because I think we need to hedge the bet that slower economic growth will rein in the outsized increases in inflation that we’ve seen prompted in part by jumps in energy costs.  But I don’t think we need to start engaging in an all-out war on inflation.  We’ve increased rates seventeen times or so, there has been some upward movement in the long end of the yield curve, and we face the risk that we will overdo.  In that regard, I had a really hard time convincing only a bare majority of my Board—and you saw this in action, Ben—to vote for an increase in the primary credit rate on our last telephone call, as most of them see the amount of tightening already in the works as sufficient ourselves overdoing, particularly if we continue on this upward path.  Perhaps the greatest challenge we’re going to face is figuring out when to stop.  That takes me to President Lacker’s proposal and President Pianalto’s comments.  I’m not one who would like to start a policy that looks to take inflation down to the levels that we saw in 2002 and 2003.  President Guynn made very good points about the fact that our experience with very low levels of inflation, a growing economy, and so forth over the past longer-run inflation scenarios in which you can choose 1½ percent or 2 percent, I really wonder about the sacrifice ratio of moving from 2 percent to 1½ percent and building in a policy pre-commitment to that.  If you take the wording in alternative C and match it with some of the language that has been out there recently, you will build into the market an expectation that we are hell-bent on taking the inflation rate down no matter what.  That’s too much emphasis on one of our goals at the sacrifice of the other.  So I think we need to have some leeway in the statement to pause, maybe in August, maybe later.  I’m very attracted to Governor Kohn’s parsing of the statement.  When I looked at the statement last night, I wasn’t anywhere near as inclined to agree to it as I am now after his walking through it.  I do think that, by our eliminating some of the language that was there last time, it gives us some flexibility in August.  So although there are many ways to shorten it and there may be many ways to make it clearer, I think that editing it at this table does not really help a whole lot.  I would be in favor of both 25 basis points and the statement as it now stands.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support raising the funds rate 25 basis points, both on the merits and for our credibility.  On the merits, I think that certainly, as we discussed yesterday, the risks to growth are higher than they were at the May meeting but inflation risk and the recent news on inflation are certainly tilted to the upside.  So on the merits, I support an increase.  On the credibility side, the markets’ expectations are built as much on what we’ve said as on what they read in the economic numbers, and we need to follow through on those expectations.  I think it would be a mistake not to.  Now, as to the wording, I have to admit I’ve been torn.  The simulations that the staff ran were relatively sobering.  There’s likely a greater probability of needing to raise rates further, but I don’t think we’re ready to use the language in alternative C; it just doesn’t send the right message at this point.  I think there is an amount of uncertainty.  I could spend a lot of time tinkering with the language in alternative B, but I’m prepared to support the language in alternative B the way it is.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m glad that everyone agrees that the strength of a good committee is for someone to disagree, because my preference, based on the assessment of the outlook, is to maintain the funds rate at 5 percent, and I would vote accordingly if I were a voting member.  Even though the financial markets clearly expect a move to 5¼ percent at this meeting, my reading of the evidence suggests that such a move is not necessarily required at this time.  Based on what I know, a 5 percent rate is moderately restrictive and will, given time, result in an easing of inflationary pressures as the economy slows in the period ahead.   Our challenge should be to maintain this rate as the economy begins to slow, until the slowing of the economy intensifies.  I think that’s where our mistake will be made.  I have every concern about inflation.  But the numbers that we’re seeing are in the past, they’re from policy actions we took in the past, and there’s not a lot we can do about them looking backward.  We should be prepared to switch:  If the economic data show a reacceleration of the economy, then we will have real cause to make a move up.  But so long as the economy is slowing and projections show that it is slowing, then we are restrictive—mildly restrictive, as President Poole said—and we should hold firm until we bring inflation down.   I think we are implementing restrictive policy, and what we’re choosing today in raising the rates reflects our desire to steepen the projected downward inflationary trend.  Our choice today reflects our willingness to increase the risk of overshooting in an effort to decrease the risk of undershooting—that’s the tradeoff we’re making today.   So I would hold off, I would be patient, and I would be firm in keeping the rate at 5 percent until we see the inflation numbers come down—that is, if I were choosing.  In the language, I believe it is important to reemphasize our commitment to price stability.  I agree with that.  At the same time, I do not think the risks are all one-sided, and I believe we need to state this in the release.  For example, I judge that monetary policy is now restrictive or somewhat restrictive, and we should say so.  Now, I agree with those who say nineteen people can’t write a statement, but that’s something we should have in the statement going forward.  Moreover, in the current circumstances, I believe it is very difficult to devise forward-looking language that will clearly be understood by the financial markets.  Obviously, we’re talking about that here and having trouble ourselves.  So regardless of the decision at this commit to another increase in August.  And I will leave it at that.  Thank you.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig, I think everyone around the table admires you for your consistent position.  [Laughter]     MR. HOENIG.  That’s a generous word, but thank you.  [Laughter] MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I just want to step in and say that I totally agree with Tom Hoenig’s statement.  At a time when things are so uncertain, it would be really good if all of us could watch the language that we use and not get ourselves into a situation where we feel, which I know I do, pre-committed to something.  I’m in favor of this move.  I would have been in favor of it probably in any event.  But I do think there are reasons to think carefully about the pause that President Hoenig has put on the table and that has been kind of taken out of our hands.  We need to be concerned about that at this time.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the 25 basis point increase that you proposed.  Let me make a couple of comments.  First, people have used the words “modest restraint,” and “mildly restrictive.”  If we are somewhat restrictive, it’s really not very restrictive.  We have increased interest rates 75 basis points since January in nominal terms.  If you adjust for inflation, that’s 30 basis points.  Also, if you look at chart 8 in the Bluebook and you look at the current funds rate, because of the increase in inflation we appear to be a little below the equilibrium real fed funds rate today.  So I take Don’s point that long-term rates have gone up, but on a historical basis they’re still quite low, as we all know. The second point is about the long-term targets.  I realize that these are simulations and that they can change, but when you look at the results of the simulations, they are disturbing because we don’t reach either target.  If you have a 2 percent target or a 1½ percent target, you don’t reach it by 2010.  So that certainly was disturbing to me when I looked at the results.  I agree with the objective that people have stated.  Our objective in the statement should be to leave open the option for August as to whether we want to increase rates 25 basis points, whether we want to pause, or whether we want to increase more or have another increase after that.  So we certainly should leave all those options open.  In terms of the specific proposals on the table, I thought that Jeff Lacker’s two points were very interesting.  You could do both of them, or you could do one or the other.  They both accomplish the same objective.  Gary made the point that he didn’t like the phrase “unwelcome.”  You could say, “Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months, and that’s inconsistent with price stability.”  We could do something like that or “unwelcome.”   One or the other—Sandy favored the first sentence in number 4—accomplishes the same objective, but I think including one would add to the statement.  Finally, I agree with what everyone has said—that the Chairman’s testimony, the minutes, and the data that come out are going to have a great impact on the market’s expectations for what we do in August.   Just one final little edit:  If you go with alternative B, the first phrase in number 4, “although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures,” doesn’t belong there.  I don’t disagree with the phrase, but I don’t think it belongs in number 4.  It really belongs in number 3, and there is a way to work it into number 3 if we start doing that.  I just put a marker down that I’d suggest that edit if we get to that point.  I think it’s part of the rationale, not an assessment of risk.  Thank you.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support a 25 basis point move at this meeting, and I share the objectives that many of the people around the table have.  I think we statement.  In the first part of the rationale, our talking about the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices and the cooling of the housing market is an important acknowledgement of what we have been doing and implicitly gets to the point that President Poole made about mild restraint because it is about the effects of our policy on what’s happening now and what’s going to be happening going forward.  I would prefer not to use the language about mild restraint.  First, I agree with the point that it’s hard to know exactly how much restraint we have.  I think President Moskow made a very good point by looking at the simulations that Vincent has given us to show that such language, at least in some interpretations, would suggest that we’re not really having very much restraint.  Second, and very important from a communications standpoint, if we say this now, then in the future we’re always going to have to characterize how much restraint we are having in the market.  So then we have “mild restraint,” then we have “modest,” and then we take off the word in front.  I think it gets us into a very bad dynamic.  So I would prefer to leave that idea implicit.  It is important to have it in there, through the discussion of the lagged effects of our policy.  We could even say “lagged effects of current policy,” if we really wanted to emphasize something like that.  But I would prefer to go about it that way.  With respect to some of the suggestions that President Lacker has made, I think it’s very clear that I very much share his objectives and concerns about unanchoring expectations.  In each maintaining credibility and know full well the great costs of trying to reestablish credibility once it is lost.  That said, we have to put the movements that we’ve seen in expectations over the past six weeks in a broader context, and I don’t think they’ve moved all that much.  I would prefer them not to be moving up and down; I would prefer that we maintain very clear credibility; but I don’t think that they’ve moved a lot or moved in a way that I consider sufficiently large to be disturbing.  So from that point of view, I would be averse to including the word “unwelcome.”  I consider the word “unwelcome” unwelcome in this statement [laughter] because I don’t think we need to say that or convey it in that way here.  We can convey it through a variety of other means.  But I share the broad objective.  I’m a bit wary of trying to bring in some of the alternative C language into alternative B because I’m concerned about the market’s focusing too much on specific measures when we start talking about the medium-term decline in core inflation.  There may, then, be an overreaction to PCE numbers or CPI numbers that come out, and that would be a bit of my concern.  Something that I very much like in alternative B at the end of the assessment of risks is that we talk about the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, which is very much forward-looking and a bit more concrete, which I think is very valuable and helps to clarify our objectives.  Finally, something that Vice Chairman Geithner brought up—I think there’s a tension between what some people want to achieve and the language that we’re going to use to achieve it.  I concur broadly with the comment that a number of people have made—that alternative B will probably bring down the market’s odds regarding what we’re going to do in August from its recently elevated levels.  We’re going to be getting some important data.  We’ll be getting two temporary or not.  After we see four or five months of data, we will be able to start pulling out whether something is temporary or not.  We have some other important numbers coming up, and so I support basically keeping alternative B as it is.  I think that is the best way to achieve the objective of leaving our options open but not in any way unanchoring expectations.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I support the 25 basis point increase at this meeting, and as several people have said, I think the real issue is what we signal going forward.  Let me refer to some comments already made and respond to some of my colleagues.  President Poole, I’m sort of right where you are:  I’m thinking 50-50 going forward, and so I’m leaning toward the neutral language that leaves our options open.  However, I’m troubled, too, as Governor Kroszner just said, about talking about our position as restraint at the moment.  I see where we are as having removed the excess accommodation.  I’m concerned that if we call this restrictive and if we want to backtrack, it might signal that we’re easing up again.  I think we’re right in the sweet spot, and I don’t really want to characterize it one way or another because, again, I think we’re where we need to be.   The other comment I would make is that we’re still seeing banks loosening lending standards.  There’s plenty of liquidity out there.  As Governor Warsh said yesterday, people are leveraging.  Pricing may be restraining, but there is liquidity.  Credit spreads are still very, very minimal.  From that perspective, the market, given what they’re seeing day to day in deal-making, I like President Moskow’s comment about moving up the first sentence of row 4, the first part about the moderation in growth, to the rationale.  As we spoke around the table yesterday, we transitory and how much will be worked out as housing cools because, again, that is really where the slowdown is coming.  The slowdown is coming from housing, but that’s what we really wanted to happen.  By having the rates rise, we’ve pulled the hot sector down closer to where we want it to be.  If you look at section 3 of alternative B, we really are laying out why we think inflation is headed in the right direction.  Productivity gains are still good.  Unit labor costs, therefore, have been held down.  Inflation expectations are contained.  We could add to those points that the moderation in aggregate demand will also help contain inflation.  However, we still have other pressures.  I think the sentence in row 4 supports that rationale, so I like the suggestion that we move it. I also agree with the suggestion that we take out the first word in the sentence, “readings on core inflation” and just say “core inflation.”  I am open to saying “unwelcome”—it serves as a signal that we are anchoring expectations.  Some numbers as high as 3.8 are very unwelcome to me, so I would be glad to stick the word “unwelcome” in there. The only other thing I would say is that in number 4 I would just put a period after “outlook for both inflation and economic growth.”  To get everybody focusing on the outlook is what we’re all talking about.  When we say “data dependent,” we mean that we need the data to validate our forecast or to modify it.  I think the markets look at just the data, and I would just as soon put a period after “growth.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me support the move of 25 basis points on the merits.  I don’t feel as though I’m constrained by market expectations for this meeting; rather, on the merits, I think that’s the right thing to do. Mr. Chairman, on the markets themselves.  My sense of things is that a bit of a herd mentality remains in the markets in that they have been waiting for our every utterance and, in some ways, they have been guided by us for a very, very long time.  The discussion we’re having today is really the tough one because we recognize that we need to wean the markets from the degree of certainty that we no longer possess.  I think this discussion is really quite healthy in doing so.  In light of that perspective, I think that alternative B strikes the right balance.  Without trying to wordsmith the statement at this point, I think that, although I share Vince’s view that ultimately the markets will get to a probability for August that is more balanced, it will take some time.  That is, I think the some “stickiness” to the view that they have now.  They will believe that we have stopped giving them guidance, that we’ve gotten out of that business, and that we are somehow culpable for that.  We have led them to the river, and now we are telling them that what they do is really their decision after all.  My own view is that this shift is a very, very good thing; but it is not going to be without some pain, and I think swipes will be made at us.  The Chairman’s monetary policy testimony will perhaps represent just a little bit of that. But a dispersion of market views as to what we should be doing, what the state of the economy is, and what the prospects are for inflation is a very healthy thing.  We will be introducing some volatility into the markets, probably in a more meaningful way than they may have seen, but on balance I think such a shift is all to the good. With that backdrop—that these markets are not focused on nuance—and the recognition that the discussion we’re having is about nuance, let me say a few things in support of alternative B.  First, in the rationale section, where we say that inflation expectations remain contained, I think the You say they’re contained now.  What was all that that we heard in between?”  The way that I get comfortable with the statement that inflations expectations are contained is that some of the movements in the markets, in the inflation surveys, in the TIPS markets, and in the commodities them as being contained, but the container may be bigger than we had said it was before.  [Laughter]  I guess I’m not troubled by that.  If we introduced language such as “unwelcome,” the the view that we were anticipating that they move up the fed funds futures markets for August.  I think that view would be very problematic in light of what I hear is the central tendency of people’s views here—that we want that bet to be fairer, closer to 50-50, and I fear that our historical use of “unwelcome” would go against what we’re collectively trying to accomplish. Let me make another comment, about the assessment of risk where we say, “The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.”  I think that people in the markets are going to focus on the word “some.”  “Some” in recent meetings has meant some further policy firming—that is, more than one move; “some” was a strong word.  In this context, after some time and understanding, which will not be at 2:16 or 2:30 or even today or tomorrow, they’re going to recognize that “some” actually weakens the statement somewhat.  Saying “some inflation risks remain” rather than “the Committee judges inflation risks remain” will, on balance, modestly lower the fed funds futures for come our August decision.  I think that taking out “some” is likely to be a good change.  So, on balance, Mr. Chairman, I support alternative B.  Some of the suggestions that have been made about how to characterize our views vis-à-vis neutrality and whether or not we’re mildly restrictive strike walking away from what the markets perceive to be firm and obvious guidance is a bigger move for them than I think this discussion may be suggesting, and I’d rather not add a new notion of neutrality, and a discussion about whether we are less loose or more tight strikes me as inopportune at this moment. I concur with a comment that President Yellen made at the outset about thinking about our want to exercise that option until we have to.  Alternative B preserves our options, on balance, for a fair fight and a fair discussion come the August meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Just very quickly, I think we should remember that the core PCE index comes out tomorrow.  If that’s an unfortunate number, it’s going to be right up against what we say, and people might say, “Some inflation risk?  We’ve got a bad number.  Where are these guys anyway?”  So I would vote for taking the “some” out and for saying, “Inflation risks remain.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would read our discussion yesterday as implying a central tendency to our forecast of an economy that’s growing basically at potential over the forecast period with a trajectory for inflation that is higher than we’d like if it were to extend over time and that moderates slowly and modestly over that period, and the risks of that forecast are still slightly to the upside.  Even if we were all quite confident about that basic forecast and had the same view of the risks around it, we couldn’t say that we actually know at this point how much more tightening we will need to achieve our target. want the fed funds rate to have a positive slope going forward.  Achieving the probability of 50-50 around a move in August would be terrific, but I don’t know if we can do that.  We want to have as much flexibility as we can have.  We want the market’s expectations about policy to be responsive to the data going forward, not sticky because of anticipation of what we’re going to do; and I think, of course, that we don’t want to pre-commit.  I believe that alternative B actually does a very nice job of achieving this objective.  But it’s all about the alternatives, and I think that alternative B, like democracy, is better than the alternatives.  [Laughter] I think we face two types of risk now.  One risk, which I think Janet articulated best yesterday, is that we may already be in the midst of what will prove to be a more acute adjustment in housing and a much more dramatic response by households to the change in expectations about future income and wealth and that the saving rate has been unsustainably low and will have to rise more significantly.  That is a plausible scenario going forward.  A second risk is that, under an expectation that we stop at 5.25, we may be left below the optimal path for policy.  I want to say two things emphasizing that risk, even though I don’t think we can judge it as the predominant one.  First, to echo what I said yesterday, if you look back at where we thought we would end and where we thought prevailing estimates of the neutral rate were, we have been way under and the market has been way under.  The Bluebook estimate of now-prevailing equilibrium illustrates a basic 200 basis point move in estimated equilibrium over this period, and the market’s expectations of the terminal rate have moved a lot.  So we may have been too loose for too long, and we may have to do more moves to adjust for the effect that our stance has had on inflationary behavior, inflation acceptance, psychology, and momentum. was very helpful—left me a little troubled because you can read those exercises as saying that, if our objective for inflation really is 1.5, we’re going to have to be tighter than 5¼ percent; and if you relax the assumption around smoothing, you get a significantly higher near-term path for the fed funds rate that is judged to be optimal. But even with that, those exercises imply a view about inflation persistence that says we’re going to be above 1.5 percent for a very, very long time.  That situation, as I said, does create some risk that people will read the persistence of inflation as implying that we have higher inflation tolerance than we do or it may make us vulnerable to some further gradual erosion in credibility.  So it’s possible that we’re going to need to be higher than the funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook, but we just don’t know, and we don’t need to make that judgment today.  We do not want to try to cap expectations at any particular level and hold them down. Just a few things on the suggestions made.  All the suggestions were very thoughtful, but I would oppose all of them.  [Laughter]  The rise in core inflation would be unwelcome if it was sustained or if it represented an expected path for inflation that was significantly higher than the central forecast.  To say that a bulge like the one we’ve seen today, given what we think is driving it, is unwelcome increases our vulnerability to the perception that we’re going to be a little too backward-looking.  We need the flexibility to stop at the point where core inflation is still accelerating, and “unwelcome” would limit our capacity to do that. I think Governor Kroszner was exactly right in resisting the suggestion that we characterize our current stance of policy as somewhat restrictive.  We don’t know how restrictive policy is; but even if we did, we should not be in the business of calibrating a judgment in our statements about how restrictive we are.  Most important, the statement says implicitly what I think, Bill, you’re economy today.  We also don’t need to be quite as vivid in saying our expectation is to bring core inflation down over the medium term to some implicit level.  “Medium term” does have a lot of flexibility in it, but as the optimal control exercises suggest, we don’t really know what the costs are of adopting a specific horizon now for bringing inflation down from what is only a very small deviation from our implicit target. I think that alternative B strikes a good balance now, and each suggestion would alter that balance in a way that would not be as good at capturing the consensus about the trajectory that was described yesterday.  So I support moving 25 today and the language in alternative B. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you all very much.  Jeff. MR. LACKER.  Just a couple of comments in response to a few things, if that’s all right, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly. MR. LACKER.  First, the statement language that we’ve been using in row 4 to try to influence the probability that we’d like to see immediately after the statement of the next move has conflated two things.  It has combined our assessment of the probability of various data coming in and our intentions about how we’re likely to react to those data.  As a result, when data come in, they have a short shelf life, and not too far out into the intermeeting period the markets become uncertain because we haven’t told them separately what our intentions are, what guides how we respond to the data.  That’s why I think alternative C, which says something about what we’re about, is going to anchor inflation much better. President Stern, I take your comments to mean that you favor something that’s synonymous with “unwelcome” but less coy, and I welcome that suggestion. them about the feasible paths of inflation, a lot of discussion or scrutiny.  I’d be interested to know whether the way in which the evolution of inflation expectations is modeled in those simulations is consistent with the possibility of more-sudden and faster changes in those expectations—as we saw, for example, in the middle of 2003 and as seems to have taken place over the last two intermeeting periods, though with small fluctuations.  It strikes me that they leave out of the entire simulation the possibility of our communications influencing those expectations in a more rapid way.  This is a debate that goes back three decades, and I don’t think we’re going to settle it here today.  But my reaction to those simulations is that it certainly seems plausible to me that we could establish more rapidly in the public’s mind our intentions to aim for inflation at 1½ percent.  And I don’t think we should shy away from attempting to communicate in a way to help that process along. Stopping when core inflation is accelerating seems to me highly implausible.  I doubt that we would be willing to take that risk with the market.  That’s exactly the problem we ran into in late out from that statement was the remark that we may pause even if inflation risks are on the high side.  That statement probably did more to call things into question in these last two intermeeting periods than anything else.  So, again, I think we need to focus on the way markets are going to interpret news coming in and the way they’re going to understand how we’re going to react.  That’s why I’ve been harping on intentions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Not to beat a dead horse here, but I think we have to be sensitive to the fact that we’re going through a very difficult time right now.  After two or three years of the there’s a great deal of uncertainty.  I don’t think we should extrapolate from the way a particular piece of information is received or remarked upon in this period to our further discussion of where we stand with regard to our statement and the kinds of things that we want to talk about. Core inflation is a backward-looking number by definition.  There will be times in which we will not want to move on our assessment of the forecast even when core inflation is rising, and I don’t think that we should view that decision as less of a commitment to inflation but rather as a reasoned balancing of our two goals.  Whatever happened after the JEC testimony is more indicative of the period we’re going through and less indicative of how we should think about the way in which we communicate.  We’ve got to keep the balance in mind.  If we don’t keep the balance in mind, I believe we are subject to overreaction, and the economy pays a penalty for that.  I don’t think we should be insensitive to that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me thank you all very much for your extremely helpful and useful comments.  I, too, think that we should raise 25 basis points at this meeting.  I think it’s justified by the basic economic situation.  The greater risk seems to be from inflation. I think also, following some things that President Lacker said, that a credibility–psychology issue is going on here.  Late in April, perhaps because of my testimony, we had a small inflation scare.  The TIPS spread widened.  The commodity prices, metals prices, essentially went vertical for a while.  The minutes, my remarks, the remarks of other Presidents and Governors succeeded in bringing those expectations down significantly, even though we had two upside surprises in the CPI during that period.  So obviously some connection exists between our talk and market expectations.  Having said that, I think we need to do what we say we’re going to do. close to where we need to be.  We don’t know for sure yet.  Obviously we have to look for more information, but in our public utterances going forward we should be somewhat more balanced about the risks and also somewhat more uncertain about where we’re going in the future.  The risk-management calculations associated with this move are quite difficult.  President Poole has mentioned the risk that if inflation expectations get embedded at a higher level, it would be much more expensive to reduce them later than it is to nip them in the bud, so to speak, at this point.  That risk argues for moving earlier rather than waiting to see what happens.  That being said, I recognize that there are also some downside risks, some potential nonlinearities in housing markets and financial markets.  So where I come out is that I think we should move but try to keep our options open and to move slowly if we do move further. With respect to the statement, I’m the first to agree it’s not a work of art.  We have a very difficult balancing act here.  First, we have achieved some credibility gains in the past few weeks.  We’d like to hold onto those or at least as much of them as possible.  However, we want to keep our options open for August, and we don’t want to generate in the market a fear that we are completely focused on inflation with no regard for output, the other part of our mandate.  It’s a delicate balancing act to show that we are aware of the inflation situation but that we are not single-mindedly focused on the inflation situation.  The statement is designed to show that we are cognizant of the inflation risk.  We take note of the elevated readings.  We mention that inflation risks remain.  We also note, however, that output is moderating and give some reasons for that, and we say in section 4 that the moderation in output will reduce some of the pressure.  Obviously there’s disagreement about how flat the Phillips curve is, but all else being equal, that will be a factor. the rationale in section 3 is more logical, but the way section 3 is structured, first it says, “Here are the things that are slowing inflation,” and then it says, “But here’s what we’re worried about.”  So if we put it there, it will downgrade it somehow; if we put it in section 4, it will say that we are aware of the output risk.  There’s also perhaps a subtlety in section 4 that the firming will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.  That’s actually an adaptation of a suggestion that President Minehan made, and what it does, I hope, is indicate that we’re looking at both variables as we make our decision. So I’m hopeful that this statement will strike the balance between conveying our vigilance, conveying our concern, maintaining our credibility gains, and removing the notions from the market that we are certain we will move in August or that we will pursue inflation single-mindedly at a rapid rate and independent of whatever happens on the real side of the economy. Again, with respect to some of the suggestions that were made, I think they’re all very interesting.  President Poole made a very interesting case.  I don’t think there’s a consensus for going to the restrictive language right now.  However reasonable it may be in principle to use the first sentence in alternative C, section 4, or to say that readings are unwelcome, I fear it will tip the balance toward a higher probability in August; perhaps this nuance is too fine, but I am concerned about the effect on the markets of perceiving the Fed as too aggressive.  There is a new Chairman.  They don’t know me.  As far as they know, I am an inflation nutter, and I want to make sure that they understand that output is one of our concerns. Those were the main points I wanted to make.  Governor Bies suggested striking the last phrase in alternative B, section 4.  I don’t feel strongly about that.  Does anyone have a view on that?  Vice Chairman Geithner. that I wouldn’t know how to answer a question about why we took it out of the formulation after having it in for some time.  Every change we make to the statement has to meet that test, and I’m not sure how I would explain it, although I think I agree with you, Governor Bies, about the reason for it.  But I just don’t think the benefits of doing it offset the need for explanation. MS. BIES.  I was just suggesting a change owing to comments from some of the folks trying to interpret us.  Whenever a piece of data comes out, the market reacts, and that reaction is part of the volatility.  To the extent that the data are anticipated, they are implicit in our forecast, and we don’t want to imply that every piece of news changes that.  I was just trying to respond to those comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me say that I hope in my monetary policy testimony to talk a bit about our framework, our focus on the forecast and on the outlook, and the fact that we will not ever respond to any individual number.  I would be quite happy to receive any suggestions that members might have about how to explain these issues.  We’ll be working on that over the next couple of weeks.  President Pianalto, did you have a comment? MS. PIANALTO.  Well, just a comment that we’ve changed “implied” to “determined.”  Is there supposed to be a difference?  Again, it’s a nuance, but will people focus on that change of word?  Is “determined” stronger than “implied”?  That’s all. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  It’s valid to change the word back to “implied.” VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  That would be fine.  Good point, Sandy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Very good.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I just want to clarify the point that Governor Bies and I were making.  We were suggesting that we move the first half of the sentence in number 4, the clause “although the the rationale part.  In the last sentence of section 3, you could remove the word “however” and just put that phrase right at the beginning of the sentence.  I think the result still would have the same continuity that you want to see in the rationale section, and I think it’s more of a rationale point than an assessment-of-risk point. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It is, but logically you would have to say “ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, inflation expectations remain contained, and the moderation of the growth of aggregate demand would help to moderate.”  Then you say “however,” signaling that these are the things that we are really worried about—resource utilization and prices of energy.  The sentence as it stands signals to me that all these things are working to constrain inflation, but we are more concerned about resource utilization and commodity prices because we put them at the end of the sentence, at the end of the paragraph, giving them the greater emphasis.  I think that putting this clause where it is conveys somewhat greater attention to aggregate demand as a new element in thinking about the inflation outlook relative to our thinking at the last meeting.  I realize that it’s a subtle issue of emphasis, and as I said, I don’t think this statement is a work of art. MR. MOSKOW.  Of course, I understand the logic, but if you do put it in section 4, as President Geithner said, it has a tendency to stay there.  We have to see what it would look like in future meetings as well.  If you then take it out, you have to question why you are doing so. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think the risk assessment is going to change.  We just changed the risk assessment from “further policy firming may be needed” to “risks remain.”  So I think that structure is somewhat more fluid than the other parts.  Governor Kohn.  MR. KOHN.  I was going to make the point President Pianalto made. 25 basis points and alternative B as modified by the one word “implied.”  You can take care of that later, Michelle?  Do you have it to distribute?  You’ve distributed it already?  MS. SMITH.  We can insert it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Fine.  Could you please call the roll? MS. DANKER.  I’ll be reading the directive wording from page 29 of the Bluebook and the assessment of risk from the table that was handed out with Vincent’s briefing. “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5¼ percent.” And “Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.” Chairman Bernanke  Vice Chairman Geithner Governor Bies    President Guynn  Governor Kohn  Governor Kroszner President Lacker   President Pianalto  Governor Warsh President Yellen   Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes do those, finish the meeting, and then have our coffee.  But first, we’ll be right back.  [Laughter] [Recess] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Sorry for that interruption.  We have a report now from the subcommittee on communications.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I distributed a memo earlier this week, a report from our communication with you about how you would like to proceed going forward.  The main thing I’d like to do is hear whether there’s any reaction to that report. Very tentatively, our idea was to cover goals, broad strategies, and philosophy in August.  A number of people thought it would be a good idea to start with that.  It might provide a framework for further consideration.  Then we would move on to the numerical definition of price stability in our two-day meeting in October, which Debbie will talk about in a few minutes.  Most people wanted to start with the numerical definition of price stability, both because it would influence a lot of what else would happen and because it reflects on the discussion we’ve just been having.  It’s relevant to the way we approach our monetary policy right now and in the immediate future.  It will certainly influence some of the discussion we have about what the announcement should say.  So a number of reasons were given for starting with that, and we proposed to do it at the October meeting.  Does anybody have any reactions?  Cathy. MS. MINEHAN.  I certainly think that at the August discussion we need to settle on the policy, the underlying goals, and all of that.  I, for one, am looking forward to an October discussion of inflation targeting about as much as I would be looking forward to a root canal.  [Laughter]  I would be happy to put it off for a standard two-day meeting in January.  I know I’m in a minority on this one, but I just wanted to register how much I’m looking forward to this.  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  You could skip it.  You could stay home. MR. GUYNN.  There’s another way to avoid that, I can tell you.  [Laughter] MR. KOHN.  Any other comments or suggestions about these sorts of near-term paths?  Hearing none, we’ll do that.  From talking with my fellow members of the subcommittee, I’m not sure that there’s much background material we could provide for the August meeting.  That will be a sort of broad philosophical discussion.  If we think of something, we will let you know; or if you folks think of something that would be helpful, please let us know. For the October meeting, I’ll ask the staff to redistribute the material that was distributed in new members, and some of us haven’t looked at it in a long time.  After reviewing that material, if we think there is some updating or some further work that needs to be done to inform that October discussion, we ought to proceed from that base.  So I’ll ask the secretary to distribute the study soon and then ask people to get back to me if they see something else they think needs to be done before VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  What does that actually mean we are going to do in discussion about conviction? MR. KOHN.  Several people thought that defining the goals would help structure the rest of the discussion, and they also had some philosophical points they wanted to make.  This goes to your existential point, perhaps, about the best general, broad, strategic way of accomplishing those goals.  I think it would be useful, and a lot of people thought it would be useful.  At least it might not be a long discussion, and we are trying to do it by extending the afternoon—that might shorten it.  table, it would be nice to get them on the table at the beginning of the discussion.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I know I’m talking too much at this meeting, but with regard to August, I think it’s also important—and this was the last item on your outline—to consider communications in a broad context, not in the narrow context of the statement.  We communicate in a lot of different ways, and I think we need to recognize that in a deeper way than we have in the past. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is certainly the intention of the subcommittee.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Ms. Danker. MS. DANKER.  Just to follow up on the memo that was distributed summarizing the results of the survey on meeting format, that survey revealed a number of areas of clear agreement.  The recent format with the separate go-rounds on the economy and policy is viewed as a good one, and there’s little appetite for substantial change to the format at least for now, but more give-and-take during the meetings would still be welcome by most.  Also, special topics are overwhelmingly considered a good use of time, with strong sentiment for using staff from both the Board and the Banks as well as for allowing enough lead time for ample preparatory work.  Finally, there appears to be widespread sentiment for lengthening the amount of meeting time, but opinions are split about whether two-day meetings are the best way to accomplish this.   On this last point, the survey results and subsequent consultations suggest that a consensus could probably be reached around a steady state of, say, four two-day meetings each year.  These four would consist of two meetings with special topics (two was, in fact, the modal response to the survey question on that) and then two meetings before the Chairman’s semiannual testimonies to allow a more in-depth discussion of the economy and the outlook with the lead-in of the chart show.  For 2007, we are thinking of a baseline of two-day meetings in January and June, as those precede the testimonies, as well as two-day meetings in perhaps March and October for traditional-style special-topic presentations.  Whenever possible, we would schedule those two-day meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays since that was the day-of-the-week option that appeared least distasteful to you in the aggregate.  [Laughter]  Now, coming back to the nearer term, as Governor Kohn noted, communications issues are likely to require significant additional meeting time before the end of this year, including perhaps a couple of two-day meetings.  Therefore, we would like to add time to the August meeting both by beginning a bit earlier and by extending into the afternoon as much as needed.  As long as the policy decision has been completed, the meeting remains in session.  In addition, we would propose to expand both the October and the December meetings to two days to accommodate the communications topic.  Discussions on this topic are, of course, expected to spill over into next year as well, but for now we are not proposing additional two-day meetings for that purpose.  Depending upon how the extended one-day meeting in August goes and how the communications agenda itself progresses, there would be various options for setting aside meeting time next year for those discussions.  So, going forward, if you are broadly in agreement with this approach to the schedule, we will be sending to your offices in the next couple of days a proposed calendar of meeting dates for the remainder of 2006 and through 2007.  We would request, if possible, a relatively prompt turnaround on identifying significant calendar conflicts because we’re receiving numerous inquiries about next year’s meeting dates, which would typically have been released by this point.  Also, as to the special topics, we plan to survey you later this year to see what special topics would be of interest for the slots next year.  So if you have any specific suggestions to make, please let Vincent or me know before then.  Then once the topics are chosen, we propose to use the System Research Advisory Committee to organize the work, with perhaps Board staff leading one special topic effort and Bank staff leading the other.  Finally, thank you also for the additional comments many of you provided on the survey.  They will be useful going forward.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions or comments for Debbie?  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Does your tentative two-day meeting schedule, Tuesday–Wednesday, include the Wednesday right before I think most of us have board meetings?  I have noted that, and I think it’s a particular problem.   I know Richmond has subcommittee meetings of the board Wednesday afternoon, and we do sometimes in St. Louis.  I know that there are a whole lot of constraints that make this scheduling extremely difficult.  I understand that, and it may be that some of us are going to have to move these committee meetings to after our board meeting.  But at any rate, if possible, I think we should try to avoid that. MR. LACKER.  Actually I like missing my committee meeting.  [Laughter] inconvenient—because Thursday is a crunch, particularly if you’re going to travel a distance. MS. DANKER.  Monday and Tuesday, again, was not the least distasteful option from the perspective of the survey respondents. MR. REINHART.  It was also the most distasteful option from the perspective of staff, both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks, because it does interfere with the briefings many of you receive and just makes our life more complicated.  I appreciate that that’s not necessarily in your welfare function. MR. POOLE.  Tuesday–Wednesday is fine if it’s not right ahead of our board meeting.  That’s the issue. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is there a possibility of rescheduling some of the board meetings?  Are they inflexible? MR. POOLE.  We’ve had second Thursday every month for our meeting since day one as far as I know. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t want to jump in here, but I suppose that, for the meeting in October, we could check with people about what days the 2007 meetings should be on. MR. REINHART.  We will do our best to solve the over-determined system that you’re telling us about. MS. DANKER.  We’ll distribute the precise dates in the next couple of days and then please just get back to us. MR. REINHART.  Also remember that Debbie said Tuesday and Wednesday in part because we also have to line it up with the calendar of international commitments, which include get there. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have complete confidence in Debbie and Vincent to solve this problem.  [Laughter] MR. MOSKOW.  When will you announce the fact that we’ll have a two-day meeting in MS. DANKER.  I think the intention is to package the ’06-’07 calendar together.  We hope to have clearance from your offices before the end of July, at which point we’ll go out with the calendar going forward.  I’m sure our Public Affairs colleagues will assist us, explaining the additional meetings later this year on the basis of the communications topic, which I think should be straightforward since that has been in the minutes. MR. REINHART.  Remember that, by the time the calendar is released, the minutes of this meeting, the Monetary Policy Report, and the Chairman’s testimony will be out, and we already had a marker in the Report to talk about the formation of the subcommittee. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  Thank you.  The next meeting is on Tuesday, August 8.  We are adjourned, and you can all join us for coffee outside. MS. DANKER.  And lunch.
