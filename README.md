BT4222 Mining Web Data for Business Insights - Effectiveness of Machine Learning and Text Mining Techniques in
Predicting Fed Rate Movement

## 01 Project Overview

### Introduction

Our project involves the application of relevant text mining and machine learning techniques to forecast the direction
of policy rates in the United States.

### Project Context

Policy rates is an important monetary policy tool that can be used to control economic activity in the country. For
instance, the Central Bank can increase the policy rates to battle inflation and prevent an overheating economy. On the
other hand, it can reduce policy rates to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates reduce the borrowing cost and
incentives investors to invest in the country, directing foreign capital into the country. Additionally, it reduces the
incentives for saving which bolsters domestic consumption.

In the U.S., policy rates are determined by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Each year, the FOMC meets eight
times to determine the near-term direction of monetary policy and interest rates. In particular, the Fed Fund Rate is
discussed, voted and determined during the meetings. Upon each meeting, FOMC publishes minutes, statements and
testimonials on its website, establishing their view on the current economic situation, and their forecast that result
in their monetary policy decision.

### Project Motivation

Many attributes result in the decision-making of the Fed Rates, but Natural Language Processing (NLP) has not been
utilized much in this area. We want to find out the effectiveness of FOMC textual data in helping to improve the
prediction of Fed Rate movement.
